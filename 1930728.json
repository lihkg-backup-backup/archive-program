The chimaera infected human airway cells &mdash; proving that the surface protein of SHC014 has the necessary structure to bind to a key receptor on the cells and to infect them. It also caused disease in mice, but did not kill them.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough almost all coronaviruses isolated from bats have not been able to bind to the key human receptor, SHC014 is not the first that can do so. In 2013, researchers reported this ability for the first time in a different coronavirus isolated from the same bat population2.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnews%2Fengineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787%3FWT.mc_id%3DTWT_NatureNews&d=Ih%2BYJd3WmO0qFhbj2imzB4nMh2OwnA7FCi%2BsKpr4SDY%3D&h=63fdc20b\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews</a>"}]}
