Benjamin Mayo reported earlier this week that protesters were using AirDrop to spread pamphlets and other material supporting their cause, but some new details have come to light.<br />\n<br />\nBlasting out jpegs to everyone who appears within AirDrop range wouldn&rsquo;t be very efficient, so protesters worked out a plan to discern who needs the material and who doesn&rsquo;t. They used the super popular website LIHKG, a kind of Hong Kong version of Reddit, to make a plan: protesters heading to the event changed the name of their iPhone to something starting with the word &ldquo;自由&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;peace&rdquo;. (Actually there is another, much more vulgar term used as well: 自由閪. You&rsquo;ll need to look up the translation; it was famously hurled at a protester by a police officer, so protesters have taken the term for themselves.) <br />\n<br />\nIf the iPhone name didn&rsquo;t contain &ldquo;peace&rdquo;, protestors knew to share the material.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s a unique approach, particularly because the targets that day were Mainland Chinese citizens who have no access to protest coverage at home (more on this below). The digital fliers were even written in Simplified Chinese which is common on the Mainland, while Hong Kong people use Traditional Chinese. It&rsquo;s an ingenious idea, but one wonders if this will catch on among protesters elsewhere.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/10/china-complains-about-apple-app-store/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2019%2F07%2F10%2Fchina-complains-about-apple-app-store%2F&d=mly3UyGsD7RWnvW57yDWjnIsb0SIwbGp5IKHDv9YBGc%3D&h=ecc3ae72\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/10/china-complains-about-apple-app-store/</a>"},{"pid":"570209b82caff5c30011ba1901a1d109a512c20f","tid":1307225,"uid":28279,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-11T12:54:32.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />輸出抗爭技術"},{"pid":"4c57f6382f3b86f6a16aa56b1031061d82f4eaaf","tid":1307225,"uid":23094,"like":7,"dislike":0,"score":7,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-11T12:59:07.000Z","msg":"super popular website LIHKG<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"19ecdd5327c075d2fc086c5a68d1700d29c7eb2b","tid":1307225,"uid":149833,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-11T13:23:36.000Z","msg":"香港呢種示威方式<br />\n的確吸引其他國家深入研究<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1a4c232040b08679073dd32f19dd596429782101","tid":1307225,"uid":31094,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-11T13:24:38.000Z","msg":"法國遲早都要嚟學示威<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/devil.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e64c93ce6c918bb3904b9b35dbc61df1b63ff61b","tid":1307225,"uid":29153,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-11T13:35:02.000Z","msg":"香港人最叻依D野<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b9ac54a892f23f74cc83c2abf7b321be5d66bac1","tid":1307225,"uid":167289,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-11T13:39:25.000Z","msg":"自由係 Peace?"},{"pid":"ae2db6f47014e304ea18087a3247e0b7ec0f8ce2","tid":1307225,"uid":63276,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"b9ac54a892f23f74cc83c2abf7b321be5d66bac1","tid":1307225,"uid":167289,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-11T13:39:25.000Z","msg":"自由係 Peace?"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-11T19:02:50.000Z","msg":"我都想講<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\nfreedom先係自由，個作者好明顯搞錯咗<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
