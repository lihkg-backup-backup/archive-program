pull off a 'Calexit' and secede from the US<br />\nMelia Robinson Feb 4, 2017, 1:00 PM ET<br />\nProtesters hold up signs during a march and rally against the election of Republican Donald Trump as President of the United States in Los Angeles, California, U.S. November 12, 2016.<br />\nLucy Nicholson/ReutersProtesters hold up signs during a march and rally against the election of President Donald Trump in Los Angeles, California.<br />\nThe last time a state seceded from the US, it was the 1860s and a civil war broke out.<br />\n<br />\nStill, history hasn't stopped a small group of Californians from pursuing a breakaway from the union in the wake of President Donald Trump's rise to office.<br />\n<br />\nSince the election, the &quot;Calexit&quot; movement has grown from a hashtag trending on social media to a legitimate campaign for California's independence. Secession backers are now collecting voter signatures to get a measure on the 2019 state ballot which, if passed, would help clear a path for legal secession.<br />\n<br />\nOne in three Californians surveyed by Reuters/Ipsos in a recent poll want the state to leave the US. Still, the event of a Brexit-like secession remains unlikely.<br />\n<br />\nMany opponents have taken to Twitter to remind Calexit backers that Texas already tried to secede in the past - and failed miserably.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTexas has attempted a &quot;Texit&quot; time and time again. Residents of the Lone Star State passed resolutions calling for a vote on secession recent as March 2016.<br />\n<br />\nOne big obstacle: The US Constitution lays out procedures for how a new state may enter the union, but there are no protocols for a nation to exit.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;There's no legal path to secession,&quot; Cynthia Nicoletti, an associate professor of law at University of Virginia School of Law and author of the upcoming book, &quot;The Treason Trial of Jefferson Davis: Secession in the Aftermath of the Civil War,&quot; told Business Insider last year.<br />\n<br />\nShortly after Barack Obama was re-elected to the presidency in 2012, disgruntled Texans filed a petition to the White House asking that the administration &quot;peacefully grant&quot; the state the right to withdraw from the union. It racked up over 125,000 signatures. The director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, Jon Carson, dashed their dreams in his response.<br />\n<br />\nCarson wrote that our founding fathers established in the US Constitution &quot;the right to change our national government ... But they did not provide a right to walk away from it.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThat leaves two paths, according to Nicoletti. &quot;You're going to need a constitutional amendment or you're going to need a revolution,&quot; she said."},"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2018-12-03T22:47:22.000Z","msg":"That leaves two paths, according to Nicoletti. &rdquo;You&rsquo;re going to need <span style=\"font-size:
