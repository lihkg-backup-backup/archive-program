Arsenal is one of the biggest clubs in the world. We need to be competing for the top trophies in the game and that&rsquo;s been made very clear to me in my discussions with Stan and Josh Kroenke, and the senior people from the club.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;We all know there is a lot of work to be done to achieve that but I am confident we&rsquo;ll do it. I&rsquo;m realistic enough to know it won&rsquo;t happen overnight but the current squad has plenty of talent and there is a great pipeline of young players coming through from the academy.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nMikel&rsquo;s coaching team will be announced as soon as possible. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.arsenal.com/news/mikel-arteta-joining-our-new-head-coach\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arsenal.com%2Fnews%2Fmikel-arteta-joining-our-new-head-coach&d=Wr%2FXdV%2FekiVpClOitW4NQTrpXFO54mr1mpDNnesGdkc%3D&h=6e1dfa6f\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.arsenal.com/news/mikel-arteta-joining-our-new-head-coach</a>"}]}
