However, the revolution is far from over. We have repeated our five demands to the corrupt government since June, and all we got was nothing other than tear gases, rubber bullets, and batons to the head. It is too late to withdraw the bill after all the horrible things that this revolution has revealed.<br />\n<br />\nThe five demands are as follow:<br />\n1. Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill<br />\n2. Retraction of the riot characterization of the June 12 protest<br />\n3. Release and exoneration of arrested protesters<br />\n4. Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police brutality and conducts /<br />\n    Re-organization of HKPF<br />\n5. Implementation of universal sufferage<br />\n<br />\nSo far, the government has only responded to the first demand, and it may not even be a complete withdrawal since it requires the winning of a majority of votes in LegCo where the pro-Beijing camp has virtually absolute control. This whole thing could be a wording game to fool foreigners that the bill is dead, just like what happened on July 9 when Carrie Lam announced the so-called &quot;death&quot; of the bill but never officially withdrew it. However, once again, it does not matter anymore if the bill was dead or not. After the suicides of 8 protesters, 2100+ injuries including permanent loss of eyesight and cervical bone fractures, two attacks from the police and triads in the MTR stations and 1100+ arrested, this revolution revealed many underlying yet glaring issues with the corrupt government and made us completely lost hope to them. If we decided to bend down now, our deceased friends would not forgive us. Too many tragedies have happened since June 9, and Carrie Lam practically caused all of them by implementing a bill that two million of us have never asked for in the first place.<br />\n<br />\nWe believed you had seen the footage recorded during the Yuen Long and Prince Edward Station Attack, the unprecedented brutality and misconduct of the police force are making us question whether Hong Kong is turning into a police state. Moreover, several of the citizens and protesters are still missing during the Prince Edward Station Attack, and yet the pro-China MTR company has refused to hand out the CCTV footage of that night, presumably under pressure from the police. This rejection raised severe concerns about what happened during that night. We strongly suspect that the police might have caused the death of one or more people, whether accidentally or intentionally. If this is the case, the police and the government behind are preventing the truth from reaching to the general public to avoid the massive ramification and outrage they will face. They are broadcasting the fact that they will do anything to maintain the stability of the government, even it means the death of innocent citizens and severely undermining the freedoms that our city once had. With this in mind, we are not even sure if an independent commission can genuinely bring back justice anymore. A total re-organization of the HKPF and the government is desperately needed.<br />\n<br />\nThe ultimate and only solution to the above issues is the implementation of universal suffrage. Therefore, let us repeat one more time, the government must fulfill all five of the demands immediately. The withdrawal of the bill is not a victory as the media have mentioned, it is the result of numerous Hongkongers sacrificing their lives and futures on the city's bloodshed streets. If anything, it proved to us that the only way to make a totalitarian regime bend down is by fighting back ferociously.
