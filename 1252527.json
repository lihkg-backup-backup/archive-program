/>\n<br />\n岩岩有巴打提出可以利用G20 機會係有關既國家登報紙頭版公開信：<br />\n<br />\n但要搞呢個Project 需要搞好多野，希望民間高手可以出黎幫下手集思廣益，依家要需要既資源同考量係：<br />\n<br />\n1. 封信，要登報首先要有野登，我地需要巴打寫一手靚英文既公開信，然後比巴打幫手翻譯做其他語言（德法日文）<br />\n<br />\n2. 設計，無理由就咁白紙黑紙寫篇文就算掛，起碼都執靚少少觸目D多D人睇，萬一落唔到頭版都可以吸引人睇。<br />\n<br />\n3. 登邊度：美國德國日本呢三個幫香港出過聲既不在話下，特別係美日，因為G20 係日本搞，而美國可以話不嬲都係主力打手。<br />\n<br />\n4. 錢，要登報紙當然要比錢，但問題係點集資，有巴打講過可以試下用Gofundme或者fringebacker，或者如果有巴打有其他suggestion 都好，重點係要有人點搞，集左資之後要follow返去搞銀行手續去俾錢同睇實D錢，重點係mission fail既要分返D錢俾巴打。<br />\n<br />\n5. 有錢唔係大晒，都有睇個報紙有無檔期，會唔會比人買左，但一間唔得可以試第間。所以都要人手聯絡報館問價。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n原post係度<br />\n假如628各地報紙都見到公開信？<br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/PjkzPU\"

Our liberal future is doomed, though, unless we get your support before the G20 Summit meeting.<br />\n<br />\nSince the Summit is to be held this Friday, the local government has paused its witch hunt, as its earlier violent crackdown on peaceful protesters had embarrassed Chinese President Xi Jinping. His US counterpart Donald Trump will meet Xi and raise the issue. But this shield will fade soon. If the two leaders strike a deal, Hong Kong&rsquo;s fate risks being ignored. A worse crackdown, both physical and institutional, may then follow.<br />\n<br />\nThe protests stemmed from the public's opposition to the government&rsquo;s plan to allow suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. This prospect has worried the grassroots, professionals and chambers of commerce across the Atlantic alike. They fear the breakdown of the &ldquo;firewall&rdquo; between the two jurisdictions, which has separated the common-law practicing Hong Kong from the rest of China. <br />\nThe government ignored the ire, though. On 9 June 2019, after a million citizens marched, the government insisted that debate of the bill be resumed in three days&rsquo; time. <br />\n<br />\nWithout a choice, on 12 June 2019, tens of thousands of people occupied the streets to deny legislators access to the chamber. In response, the police dispersed the crowds with violence unseen for decades. Peaceful protesters were attacked with tear gas, rubber bullets, and beanbag shots, which Amnesty International later found &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; and &ldquo;excessive&rdquo;. Hundreds of them, including journalists, were injured, some critically. <br />\n<br />\nThe injured, however, were denied treatment. The police obstructed ambulances. Worse, many of the wounded avoided medical help, fearing arrests in hospitals. Later, a doctor confirmed that the police could access a hospital system which indicated patients&rsquo; attendance of  &ldquo;mass gatherings&rdquo;. <br />\n<br />\nFor those arrested, the charges include &ldquo;rioting&rdquo;. The implication is stark, as convicts are subject to 10 years imprisonment. The use of such an ordinance has been slammed by former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten for infringing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.<br />\n<br />\nThe same night, the chief executive Carrie Lam refused to budge in her televised speech. This caught worldwide attention. US congressmen touted reintroduction of Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, called the protests a &ldquo;beautiful sight to behold&rdquo; and hinted at reassessment of the special status US conferred on Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nOnly three days later did Lam try to reduce the tension, probably because her act had recklessly given Washington an edge in its negotiation with Beijing, which was not pleased. That said, while she promised suspension of the bill, she fell short of withdrawing it, or retracting her description of the protest as a riot. <br />\n<br />\nCurrently, the police have restrained itself. This will not last. The government&rsquo;s thinking is that once the G20 summit is over, international scrutiny does not matter. It may then restart its mass campaign of arrests, aimed at silencing and revenging on Hong Kong citizens. Worse, the bill may get reintroduced, as a pro-government figure hinted. But at that time, we may lose completely.<br />\n<br />\nAgainst such a background, if we wish to have our humble demands - withdrawal of the bill, setting up of an independent commission, and refraining from prosecuting peaceful protesters - met, they are to be achieved before the G20 meeting, or never. <br />\n<br />\nWe desperately need urgent help. We sincerely hope that you stand with us and voice your support before we become another victim in the global trend of democratic recession.<br />\n<br />\nYours truly,<br />\nFreedom-loving Hong Kong citizens"},{"pid":"63dbd1601977ee0fbe913207fa3fae9d35de263b","tid":1252527,"uid":215715,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"3c7563d9edaa377ef13e59303bdd66ad3a275019","tid":1252527,"uid":253119,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"7f45faf184503449d10a5bd2c3d314bb075c1123","tid":1252527,"uid":215715,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a157e199b3cc5ba5364c30686ed5618619adb8bc","tid":1252527,"uid":258170,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T02:23:06.000Z","msg":"wow"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T02:25:07.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n我直接出冇proofread <br />\n有串錯唔該巴打大大力屌"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T02:32:11.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/chicken.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T02:34:13.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/@.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0780236e7a5c4493538e8f07707bafd04cd9dbe0","tid":1252527,"uid":258170,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"fc5a2965d55e0dd5d15667fcfa33d528b9845875","tid":1252527,"uid":215715,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":4,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T02:18:58.000Z","msg":"Open letter from Hong Konger to the free world: <br />\n<br />\nWhen the eyes of the world were on Hong Kong 22 years ago, barely anyone of us could have ever expected this.

Our liberal future is doomed, though, unless we do something before the G20 Summit meeting.<br />\n<br />\nIt was the amendments to the fugitive ordinance proposed in May. The law potentially allowed the Hong Kong government to send suspects requested by China without going through Hong Kong&rsquo;s judicial procedures.
