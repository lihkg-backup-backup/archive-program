Aware that Chinese nationals attending U.S. universities or finding employment at U.S. national laboratories, innovation centers, incubators, and think tanks may have access to cutting-edge information and technologies, <strong>the Chinese State has put in place programs aimed at encouraging Chinese science and engineering students &ldquo;to master technologies that may later become critical to key military systems.&rdquo;</strong><br />\n<br />\n The national and economic security risks are that <strong>the Chinese State may seek to manipulate or pressure even unwitting or unwilling Chinese nationals into becoming non-traditional information collectors that serve Beijing&rsquo;s military and strategic ambitions.</strong> <br />\n<br />\n&hellip;&hellip;FBI Director Christopher Wray....responded that the FBI has observed &ldquo;the use of nontraditional collectors, especially in the academic setting, whether it's professors, scientists, students&hellip;in almost every&hellip; field office that the FBI has around the country. It is not just in major cities, it's in small ones as well. <strong>It's across basically every discipline; and I think the level of naivet&eacute; on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues.&rdquo; </strong><br />\n<br />\nIn FBI Director Wray&rsquo;s view, <strong>Chinese non-traditional collectors &ldquo;are exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have</strong>, which we all revere. But<strong><span style=\"color: red;\"> they're taking advantage of it, so one of the things we're trying to do is view the China threat as not just the whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat on their end, and I think it's going to take a whole-of-society response by us.&rdquo;</span></strong> <br />\n<br />\nAs the DIUx Pentagon Report notes: Academia is an opportune environment for learning about science and technology since the cultural values of U.S. educational institutions reflect an open and free exchange of ideas. As a result, Chinese science and engineering students frequently master technologies that later become critical to key military systems, amounting over time to unintentional violations of U.S. export control laws."},{"pid":"60e3abe674d4a2088894cab46b38e90d19e6f5d1","tid":710907,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-21T06:49:49.000Z","msg":"<strong><ins>Chinese Nationals In the U.S. as Non-Traditional Information Collectors</ins></strong><br />\n上面整錯咗"},{"pid":"e4cf0f8fe8fc9e16abf7f4cf7bbbdc15df982e3c","tid":710907,"uid":14918,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-21T06:57:19.000Z","msg":"巴打好有心<br />\n<br />\n搵到份report出黎<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
