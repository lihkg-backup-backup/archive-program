China really hasn't,&quot; Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated, told CNBC's &quot;Trading Nation&quot; on Wednesday.<br />\n<br />\nThe S&amp;P 500 and Dow broke records on Thursday, while the Shanghai composite was stuck in a bear market. The Chinese stock market index has fallen 24 percent since its highs set in late January.<br />\nThe monetary impact of tariffs also tips the trade war in favor of the U.S., said Chiavarone.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;When we add up all the impact of tariffs, they come up to just a fraction of the stimulus being added into the economy in the U.S. and I think the market is really starting to ferret that out,&quot; he said.<br />\nBy Chiavarone's calculation, the sum of tariffs over the next three years amounts to just one-tenth of the effect of stimulus. <br />\n<br />\nHe estimates that tax cuts, repatriation and government spending should bring in around $2 trillion through to 2020, while this round of tariffs could total $200 billion over the same stretch.<br />\nView Related Chart<br />\n<br />\nThe U.S. winning this trade war is crucial for its standing as an economic powerhouse in the next Industrial revolution, said Chiavarone. He explains that the next revolutionary wave hinges on key technologies such as automation, artificial intelligence, robotics, the internet of things, 3D printing and blockchain.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;If you control the technologies of the next Industrial Revolution, you're going to be the world's pre-eminent economic power. We control those today. The Chinese would like to and therein lies that conflict,&quot; said Chiavarone. &quot;Ultimately I think it's something that the market feels is worth us exploring.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nChiavarone expects U.S. stocks to continue to drive higher as the Trump administration makes progress in its other trade deals such as NAFTA.<br />\n<br />\n中國依家真係好唔掂。外憂內患，幾時求和or 爆？<img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />  <br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"> PS 厲害了我的國</span><br />\n<br />\nsorce，延伸閱讀：<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/09/20/america-is-winning-the-trade-war-heres-proof-market-watcher-says.html?__source=instagram%7Cmain\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2Famp%2F2018%2F09%2F20%2Famerica-is-winning-the-trade-war-heres-proof-market-watcher-says.html%3F__source%3Dinstagram%257Cmain&d=PfME75FzGX8h9tP9z3Zjnh4KspRE1ZdqvS7v6cf6aI4%3D&h=c9962f69\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/09/20/america-is-winning-the-trade-war-heres-proof-market-watcher-says.html?__source=instagram%7Cmain</a>"},{"pid":"fc2fc81af91be4c18f081091951f4674fa65e26c","tid":834879,"uid":14918,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T12:40:26.000Z","msg":"求咩和<br />\n<br />\n維尼最好權鬥贏開放派<br />\n鎖國多幾十年"},{"pid":"fcc816bdbcb14acb8c08141bebb8fbe8629473b9","tid":834879,"uid":9286,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T12:40:45.000Z","msg":"睇下清末拖咗幾耐先投降 就大概估到中共仲要拖幾耐投降<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"aa272d483235b661a8b61e217ecf3be3aae43f5e","tid":834879,"uid":91294,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"fc2fc81af91be4c18f081091951f4674fa65e26c","tid":834879,"uid":14918,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T12:40:26.000Z","msg":"求咩和<br />\n<br />\n維尼最好權鬥贏開放派<br />\n鎖國多幾十年"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T12:41:40.000Z","msg":"但香港未一齊pk <img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a7a1c6928211aa1041107c87b1b257d02451cec5","tid":834879,"uid":91294,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"quote":{"pid":"fcc816bdbcb14acb8c08141bebb8fbe8629473b9","tid":834879,"uid":9286,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T12:40:45.000Z","msg":"睇下清末拖咗幾耐先投降 就大概估到中共仲要拖幾耐投降<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T12:42:35.000Z","msg":"到時一齊食福壽膏<img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/tongue.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"89faed42fd82880319a5b466ebd1636cfddb34d7","tid":834879,"uid":9286,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a7a1c6928211aa1041107c87b1b257d02451cec5","tid":834879,"uid":91294,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"quote":{"pid":"fcc816bdbcb14acb8c08141bebb8fbe8629473b9","tid":834879,"uid":9286,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T12:40:45.000Z","msg":"睇下清末拖咗幾耐先投降 就大概估到中共仲要拖幾耐投降<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T12:42:35.000Z","msg":"到時一齊食福壽膏<img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/tongue.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T12:43:50.000Z","msg":"食人血饅頭<img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/flowerface.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d7f13caf25ea5b9578d58d28decf65d0833d5641","tid":834879,"uid":128261,"like":3,"dislike":1,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"fc2fc81af91be4c18f081091951f4674fa65e26c","tid":834879,"uid":14918,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T12:40:26.000Z","msg":"求咩和<br />\n<br />\n維尼最好權鬥贏開放派<br />\n鎖國多幾十年"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-25T00:41:34.000Z","msg":"變返老毛時代咁，最好搞多次文革<br />\n第二次文革香港唔會無份架喇<img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d9df4e6682051550e06a3d49cda9df73a809b97d","tid":834879,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-25T02:48:09.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/lomore_shocking.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/lomore_shocking.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/lomore_shocking.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"82fe530b59af3e071bf6bf0f3a6a087d7691c7c1","tid":834879,"uid":89931,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-25T02:48:32.000Z","msg":"too long no read"},{"pid":"8b8219010307c36b24c62d625fb866363a5fb7ef","tid":834879,"uid":89931,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-25T02:48:58.000Z","msg":"反正中國最後會成最大贏家<img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"37d4a19ec5dcc326e673ba81ccaaaac273e40c47","tid":834879,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-25T03:16:24.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/oh.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
