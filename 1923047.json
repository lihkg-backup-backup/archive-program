Chelsea personnel who had recent close contact with the player in the men&rsquo;s team building will now self-isolate in line with Government health guidelines. These will include initially the full men&rsquo;s team squad, coaching staff and a number of backroom staff.<br />\nIt is expected that those who did not have close contact with Callum will return to work in the coming days. In the meantime, the men&rsquo;s team building, one of several separate buildings at our training ground, will remain closed. The rest of our training facility, Stamford Bridge and our other facilities are operating as normal.<br />\n<br />\nCallum displayed symptoms similar to a mild cold on Monday morning and has not been at the training ground since then as a precaution. However, his test came in positive this evening and he will undergo a period of self-isolation. Despite testing positive for the virus, Callum is doing well and looking forward to returning to the training ground as soon as it is possible.<br />\n<br />\nWe will continue to adhere to Government and Public Health Guidelines with regard to our facilities and staff and will be discussing next steps with regards to upcoming fixtures with the Premier League on Friday morning. We will provide further updates as necessary via the club&rsquo;s website.<br />\n<br />\nWe wish Callum a speedy recovery and look forward to welcoming him back to the club soon."},{"pid":"d2d27d539b6400e97ccefdd3904877ca40aae53c","tid":1923047,"uid":132128,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-13T01:35:40.000Z","msg":"玩撚猿"},{"pid":"51fff30b4bd34efda0565afd1342516db8474f5a","tid":1923047,"uid":11061,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-13T01:36:31.000Z","msg":"屌<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d431a6e0ac2c25a032bc15bf641a98babb6c59f1","tid":1923047,"uid":29080,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-13T04:08:25.000Z","msg":"仲唔肯停CLS<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
