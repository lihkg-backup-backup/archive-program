To be clear: this is not a service where people can stream footage of themselves playing video games like Twitch, it's a service that lets people play games without downloading them by streaming them over the internet.<br />\n<br />\nThis kind of streaming technology for games has been an&nbsp;up-and-coming focus for some video game hardware companies&nbsp;like Microsoft and Sony. It saves users from taking up hardware space with large video games (which can sometimes be larger than 100 GBs) and opens up the possibility of services that allow players to play games for a limited time on a subscription basis."},{"pid":"1299e38abd9e7b2f93c7a2c856b3aef6804e7333","tid":846858,"uid":59136,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-10-03T17:20:46.000Z","msg":"佢既對手似係 nvidia 既 geforce now多啲喎"}]}
