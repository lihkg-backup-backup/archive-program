This is part of a global meetup that is happening in cities all over the planet. Everyone interested in meeting up and discussing what the future holds for us is welcome.<br />\n<br />\n​<br />\nHere's what we'll be doing at our hangout spot:<br />\n​<br />\n<br />\nAfter introductions and you have let people know why you're so excited/unhappy with the future, you can split into smaller groups or stay in the main group depending on group size. Make sure you try to meet everyone though.<br />\n​<br />\n<br />\nOnce in your group, you can start discussing and debating the following topics in any order you choose stating your pros and cons for it.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDo you believe we are heading towards a utopian future If yes/no, why?<br />\n<br />\n​<br />\nDo you think AGI/BCI(Artificial General Intelligence/Brain-Computer-Interface) will happen? If yes, when?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWhat's your preferred solution to the Fermi Paradox?<br />\n​<br />\n<br />\nWhen will we land on Mars?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWhat's our city's elevation relative to the nearest coastline? How badly and how soon will floods from sea-level rise over the next decades affect us?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWill AGI/BCIs be able to solve the looming climate crisis?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDo you prefer AGI or BCIs?<br />\n<br />\n​<br />\nBasically, would you trust an Artificial Intelligence that is a thousand times smarter than humans without any human intervention? Would you trust every action that AGI takes?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nOr would you prefer a human who has been enhanced by a computer to higher intelligence levels, but also carries the baggage of personal emotions and preferences?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFinally, we chill and discuss any off-topic stuff and other personal interests and decide whether we should do this again in the future to gauge humanity's progress again in the above-mentioned topics.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe can also hit a street food joint or restaurant afterward. We'll be splitting the bill or paying for ourselves.<br />\n<br />\n​<br />\nIf you're unfamiliar with any of the topics that come up in the discussion, no worries, just ask the person who brought it up. It's always good to learn something new. Do some prior research on your own if you'd like to learn more. This meetup should be a great opportunity to learn new stuff and the bleeding edge of research across several industries.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThis is the chat group we'll be using for choosing the hangout spot[ <a href=\"https://chat.whatsapp.com/GyNRj2oF3fbFBXnZNiYe24\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.whatsapp.com%2FGyNRj2oF3fbFBXnZNiYe24&d=2wHvujEsOXgOuf6ql2b4nDBezIcYxRdZTJmtLZSysqE%3D&h=e5191c5b\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://chat.whatsapp.com/GyNRj2oF3fbFBXnZNiYe24</a> ], whether the event should be on a Saturday or Sunday night. So, please hop in, introduce yourself and tell us which part of the city you're from! Looking forward to seeing you on event night!"},{"pid":"7e8dcb25de5726d55ffc5bfd48df2e9cdaf07449","tid":1635268,"uid":12633,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-07T13:02:32.000Z","msg":"係咪要用英文討論"},{"pid":"bf0d104957fa2d4da6d0825dcb1aed412fc5d9f0","tid":1635268,"uid":331793,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"7e8dcb25de5726d55ffc5bfd48df2e9cdaf07449","tid":1635268,"uid":12633,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-07T13:02:32.000Z","msg":"係咪要用英文討論"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-16T08:25:33.000Z","msg":"唔一定嘅"}]}
