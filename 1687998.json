It&rsquo;s basically made of animal muscle cells grown in a culture in a lab, a technology similar to stem cells.<br />\n<br />\nAdvocates say lab-grown meat is flavorful and better for the environment than conventional meat. They say it consumes less water, energy and land, produces less greenhouse gases and reduces animal suffering.<br />\n<br />\nAgriculture is estimated to generate around 13 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, with livestock alone responsible for two-thirds of those emissions, according to the United Nations&rsquo; Food and Agriculture Organization.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2018/12/1-ALEPH-FARMS-S-e1544958071318-640x400.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.timesofisrael.com%2Fwww%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F12%2F1-ALEPH-FARMS-S-e1544958071318-640x400.jpg&h=70feebba&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nAleph Farms, an Israeli startup launched in 2017, announced in December it succeeded in producing a lab-grown &ldquo;minute steak&rdquo; made from bovine cells that closely resembles the texture and flavor of its cow-borne counterpart.<br />\n<br />\nFor now, the tiny steaks are just 3 millimeters (a tenth of an inch) wide &mdash; roughly the size of a very thin strip of roast beef.<br />\n<br />\nThe first lab-grown burger was made by a Dutch company in 2013 at a cost of over $300,000. Production costs have fallen in the years since. Last year, US-based Memphis Meats&rsquo; ground beef alternative was reported to cost about $2,400 per pound. Each slice of Aleph Farms&rsquo; &ldquo;steak&rdquo; costs about $50 to produce.<br />\n<br />\nBefore it can hit the shelves, lab-grown meat will face regulatory obstacles. The US government&rsquo;s FDA and USDA announced in November they would &ldquo;jointly oversee the production of cell-cultured food products derived from livestock and poultry.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"7917ea7adabf0d9aede6f880ab951ef162f3ef9f","tid":1687998,"uid":159876,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T08:41:03.000Z","msg":"人造肉，新鮮肉類<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c8b4eac8c42e037d50a471b6ff221473f961050f","tid":1687998,"uid":120678,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"7917ea7adabf0d9aede6f880ab951ef162f3ef9f","tid":1687998,"uid":159876,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T08:41:03.000Z","msg":"人造肉，新鮮肉類<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T08:41:50.000Z","msg":"用動物幹細胞造，所以同新鮮肉類完全冇分別"},{"pid":"4072d2543cfede7578a2374711b4e1d7ad451880","tid":1687998,"uid":116331,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"c8b4eac8c42e037d50a471b6ff221473f961050f","tid":1687998,"uid":120678,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"7917ea7adabf0d9aede6f880ab951ef162f3ef9f","tid":1687998,"uid":159876,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T08:41:03.000Z","msg":"人造肉，新鮮肉類<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T08:41:50.000Z","msg":"用動物幹細胞造，所以同新鮮肉類完全冇分別"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T08:44:34.000Z","msg":"做唔做到隻口感同味道<br />\n好多時都係靠動物平時活動令到唔同部分既肉好食"},{"pid":"682175c8db958a5c4d4d657b1ee9fad980af3edb","tid":1687998,"uid":43173,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"4072d2543cfede7578a2374711b4e1d7ad451880","tid":1687998,"uid":116331,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"c8b4eac8c42e037d50a471b6ff221473f961050f","tid":1687998,"uid":120678,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"7917ea7adabf0d9aede6f880ab951ef162f3ef9f","tid":1687998,"uid":159876,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T08:41:03.000Z","msg":"人造肉，新鮮肉類<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T08:41:50.000Z","msg":"用動物幹細胞造，所以同新鮮肉類完全冇分別"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T08:44:34.000Z","msg":"做唔做到隻口感同味道<br />\n好多時都係靠動物平時活動令到唔同部分既肉好食"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T09:04:39.000Z","msg":"喺太空0重力，有隻活牛有運動都唔會練到肌肉"},{"pid":"adeb10ab0fababb97117424f8ab5575325b84554","tid":1687998,"uid":124690,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T09:08:04.000Z","msg":"睇錯製造人肉"},{"pid":"f4c4ab1486706e83480e569b1163fec323ec015d","tid":1687998,"uid":186844,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T09:36:36.000Z","msg":"互食咪得 輕鬆簡單<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/sowhat.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
