Yet, it is the sugar-coated poison to deceive the citizens to temporally relieve people's wrath. <br />\n<br />\nThe credibility of Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is seriously doubt. <br />\n<br />\nFirst, it is not what its name stated, &lsquo;independent&rsquo;. The members of the IPCC were somehow with their own political stance, where mainly they are Pro-Beijing (*1). The new members introduced by Carrie Lam includes Paul Lam, former chairman of Bar Council, and Helen Yu Lai Ching-ping, campaign advisors of Carrie Lam during Chief Executive Election of 2017. It is afraid that the IPCC cannot work political neutrally in handling complaints on such events. <br />\n<br />\nSecond, the rate of successful complaints was extremely low. Since the establishment of IPCC (2009), there were over thousands of complaints were submitted. Yet, only around 3-4% were accepted as verified. Most of the involved police members were warned only, causing no deterrent effect. (*2)<br />\n<br />\nTo conclude, establishing independent probe is the only way to resolve the issue.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong citizens made it crystal clear that &lsquo;5 demands no 1 less&rsquo;. <br />\n<br />\n1/ Completely withdraw Extradition Bill. <br />\n2/ Retract the proclamation that protesters were riots <br />\n3/ Withdraw criminal charges against all protesters <br />\n4/ Establish independent probe to thoroughly investigate abuse of powers by the police. <br />\n5/ Dissolve the Legislative Council by administrative order, and immediately implement Dual Universal Suffrage."},{"pid":"bf5003a40985c94e0afc87c0ab2f9b1649690455","tid":1541029,"uid":60410,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T13:19:47.000Z","msg":"Over the past few months, the crisis aroused due to the extradition bill is far more than the bill itself. It is a humanitarian disaster that it has become. It is evident that the police adopt excessive force on the protesters, even on the pedestrians passing by the protesting scene. The lethalness of the weapons escalates from baton, tear gas to bean bag rounds, even lethal 9mm ammunition. <br />\n<br />\nSince the &ldquo;Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Bill Protest&rdquo; began, 8 martyrs have died already. 3 eyes of our fellows were taken by &lsquo;being hit accidentally&rsquo; by police&rsquo;s bullets. 2 brave young men were harmed seriously by the members of triads with knives. Over 100 people were charged. Over 1000 people were arrested. <br />\n<br />\nThe real fear is not the physical harm. The real fear is the erosion of freedom and rule of law. <br />\n<br />\nThe Basic Law stated clearly that &lsquo;Hong Kong residents shall have freedom of speech, of the press and of publication; freedom of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration; and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions, and to strike.&rsquo;. In the past few months, such basic rights of Hong Kong citizens were seriously invaded. Some of the assembly were objected due to unknown reasons. Some of the citizens were arrested just because they held opposite opinions with government. Even worse, the police were biased to the supporters of the government, taking the law to their own hands. We strongly stand against the white fear brought by the Hong Kong Police and Hong Kong Government. <br />\n<br />\nWe will not forget our sadness and our anger, but we will keep kindness in our hearts, and we wish no more people will die for the cause of freedom, justice and democracy. We hope the society will stick together, fight against tyranny, and protect Hong Kong together. We all believe that an elected government would bring us a better future.<br />\n<br />\n#5demandsno1less<br />\n<br />\n自行加Tag<br />\n監警會擬主動查6.12衝突 清一色建制派 無權全盤檢視<br />\n<a
