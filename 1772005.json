/>\n＞要求示威者無條件和平抗爭係雙重標準，因為咁做只會忽略咗政權暴力。<strong><span style=\"color: orange;\">無論示威者做乜都好（包括只破壞特定目標），政權都會將示威者稱為「暴徒」或者「罪犯」去合理化同正當化暴力打壓行動</span></strong>。<br />\n＞作者認同應以和平抗爭為目標，但當情況絕望時，武力反擊最少可以令抗爭者有「主動性」，而非一味受苦。<br />\n＞西方雖然呼籲和平抗爭，但歷史上，好多所謂成功既和平示威，其實都有大規模針對警察既武力，呢種武力有時可以成功令政權部隊退卻。<br />\n＞<span style=\"color: orange;\"><strong>外人呼籲和平抗爭，其實係假設緊自己比抗爭者更清楚局勢</strong></span>。事實上香港抗爭者好清楚8964係咩一回事，但佢地亦知道如果自己唔反抗，就會變成下一個新疆。<strong><span style=\"color: orange;\">外人係無資格為抗爭者決定要容忍政權暴力到邊一個地步</span></strong>。<br />\n＞甘地提倡和平抗爭，但甘地其實認為武力反抗總比成為懦夫好。馬丁路德金有陀槍，亦提倡大家要以武力自衛。孟德拉成為和平抗爭既象徵前，亦有提倡使用武力。<br />\n＞研究顯示，勇武抗爭有時會嚇走和平示威者，但<strong><span style=\"color: orange;\">當政權被視為不合法同腐敗時，勇武抗爭不但唔會嚇走人，更可能會增加大家信心</span></strong>。<br />\n＞雖然統計顯示和平抗爭成功率較高，但<strong><span style=\"color: orange;\">如果唔理解抗爭背後既政治同社會脈絡而罔下判斷批評武力抗爭，咁係極不負責任</span></strong>。<br />\n＞如果抗爭者喺暴力政權打壓下見唔到和平出路，咁外人更應該聯手向政權施壓。"},{"pid":"42e76819c3c40042823ca2f86c3411ff80fdd748","tid":1772005,"uid":165683,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-06T09:15:03.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"383b8c30f88809e3cbb6cb67d88d1def45335a6c","tid":1772005,"uid":165683,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-06T09:15:32.000Z","msg":"其實可以spin

Nelson Mandela was an insurgent and advocate of violent struggle before he became a symbol of nonviolent resistance. The threat of violence in South Africa was crucial in pushing the apartheid regime to compromise, despite conservative critics wishing Mandela were more like King and Gandhi.<br />\n<br />\nMore problematic for nonviolent resistance advocates, however, are questions about the evidence used to proclaim the consistently superior effectiveness of nonviolence. Studies of nonviolent resistance were reinvigorated by Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan&rsquo;s 2011 book Why Civil Resistance Works, which found that nonviolent movements are on average more likely to achieve their goals.<br />\n<br />\nBut many movements have a mix of nonviolent mass protests and more violent, radical flanks that engage in unarmed collective violence with sticks, stones, fists, or Molotov cocktails. As Chenoweth and co-authors recently acknowledged, evidence on the effects of radical flanks is mixed. Sometimes violence by protesters may backfire and alienate the public, but other times, when the government is viewed as illegitimate or corrupt and protesters as justified, it may have no effect or even bolster support for protesters&rsquo; cause. In more authoritarian settings, it may not be possible to stage a sustained protest without some degree of violent resistance to security forces, who would otherwise sweep protesters off the streets.<br />\n<br />\nEven when statistical studies are based on good data and find that nonviolent resistance is more effective, that broad principle cannot apply to all situations. Without deep knowledge of a particular political and social context, it is irresponsible to tell protesters that nonviolence will be more effective. That&rsquo;s an ethical argument, not an evidentiary one.<br />\n<br />\nIn a perfect world, protesters&mdash;and governments&mdash;would not resort to violence. But if anti-authoritarian protesters feel they have no other way out from under a violent, repressive government, then solidarity and pressure on the government, not moralizing, is the best way to support the movement."},{"pid":"257a21a8bd87dddbc2aaab8ab564c5f78051aab7","tid":1772005,"uid":161011,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-06T14:02:33.000Z","msg":"推"}]}
