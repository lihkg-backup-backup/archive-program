The aim is to promote smart city development and supporting 5G mobile network implementation. <br />\n<br />\nUnder the current planning, only three types of city data will be collected via the smart lampposts to enhance city and traffic management services of relevant departments, they are meteorological data, air quality data and traffic snapshot images in low resolution.  Data collected will only be transmitted to relevant government departments (i.e. Hong Kong Observatory, Environmental Protection Department and Transport Department), and will also at the same time be uploaded as open data to the Public Sector Information (PSI) Portal (<a href=\"http://data.gov.hk\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.gov.hk&d=1ZU4T503J%2FBBtE%2F0CauWlfFBXrQbHxe6tNmRytRnjp4%3D&h=6326abb1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">data.gov.hk</a>) for free access by the public and the industry to promote development of more innovative applications.  All data will be deleted immediately after transmission and will not be stored in the lampposts. <br />\n<br />\nThe smart lampposts do not carry any facial recognition function and no walking gaits or other biometric data will be collected. <br />\n<br />\nUnder the scheme, all smart lampposts will be installed on public roads/streets and none will be installed in MTR Stations or shopping malls.  We have released the locations, functions and equipment of the 50 smart lampposts which have been installed so far, and also published them as open data on PSI Portal for public reference.  The aim is to enable the public to have an objective and better understanding of the functions and applications of the lampposts.  These 50 lampposts are now in place on Sheung Yuet Road in Kowloon Bay and Shing Kai Road in Kai Tak and in the Kwun Tong city centre.  Information on any new batch of smart lampposts to be installed or functions to be added to the lampposts in future will also be released to the public with the same level of transparency.   <br />\n<br />\nFurthermore, we will also continue to brief the Legislative Council on the progress of the scheme, and consult relevant District Councils before installing the remaining 350 or so lampposts. <br />\n<br />\nThank you very much for your
