Its legal justification is drawn from Article 2, Section 2, of the Constitution, which states, &quot;The President &hellip; shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.&quot; Because of their common basis, the difference between amnesty and pardon has been particularly vexing. In theory, an amnesty is granted before prosecution takes place, and a pardon after. However, even this basic distinction is blurry&mdash;President GERALD R. FORD, for example, granted a pardon to President RICHARD M. NIXON before Nixon was charged with any crime. Courts have allowed the two terms to be used interchangeably."}]}
