When the participants felt the urge to move a finger, they had to note the dot's position. Libet recorded brain activity several hundred milliseconds before people expressed their conscious intention to move.</code><br />\n<br />\n而John Dylan 係2008 年同2011 年想重覆Benjamin Libet既研究 用更新既技術去(fMRI) 做實驗 Mon住受試者既腦部反應 要受試者隨便選擇左或右按鈕 但係受試者進入意識佢想選擇邊個按鈕前 在形成意識前大約7秒 相關腦部有反應 但係研究人預測只揾到60%準確率<br />\n但係無論點都好之後都有唔少相關同類似研究係我地有意識前作出反應或決定前 腦部已經開始工作緊 究竟自由意志應該點解讀好呢？ <br />\n<br />\n(等睇哲學L Vs Bio L大戰)  <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/tongue.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"19a67fa64f62759b4e1c0a565d7fd04848caeffd","tid":2335897,"uid":255045,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T09:21:06.000Z","msg":"留名<br />\n想睇<img src=\"/assets/faces/catxm/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4111022d5c4c469f05f0913fbdc67b21fd1fb6f8","tid":2335897,"uid":41355,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T09:22:19.000Z","msg":"推到大戰 留名"},{"pid":"6cdd1e3a5400e9f18c3e596b0fe8bcfd12f886d3","tid":2335897,"uid":41355,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T09:26:17.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/UX7bs4uvPyc\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FUX7bs4uvPyc&d=YgirQyY3AADlg18%2F%2B2KZ%2FVR4K0ufT%2FFGu3kbIPb6xA8%3D&h=d7704937\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/UX7bs4uvPyc</a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/joCOWaaTj4A\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FjoCOWaaTj4A&d=YgirQyY3AADlg18%2F%2B2KZ%2FVR4K0ufT%2FFGu3kbIPb6xA8%3D&h=f34a8d7f\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/joCOWaaTj4A</a><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/29.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a0f2a1765bc44c40691a1dc1ea55965332b0da17","tid":2335897,"uid":37869,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T09:41:28.000Z","msg":"有冇可能用潛意識解釋呢種現象？"},{"pid":"f6a96176b571ba917ded1e6056b6bba59f911d9c","tid":2335897,"uid":44403,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T10:47:14.000Z","msg":"其實人類根本就無完全自由意志，從好多Social psy出名嘅實驗都可以得出呢個結論"},{"pid":"09cf14272173f5db534739b29251d8e980565272","tid":2335897,"uid":244368,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T10:51:27.000Z","msg":"反基因方程式"},{"pid":"474c4811cac927159be3180769334715bd654c6f","tid":2335897,"uid":66882,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"f6a96176b571ba917ded1e6056b6bba59f911d9c","tid":2335897,"uid":44403,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T10:47:14.000Z","msg":"其實人類根本就無完全自由意志，從好多Social psy出名嘅實驗都可以得出呢個結論"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T10:52:05.000Z","msg":"Eg?"},{"pid":"172f54e7f70baf56e33b64185af5f4944ed444ae","tid":2335897,"uid":370010,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T10:56:55.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"89cf1aa012d81acbab59ca3b0d6fec8f6a87e71c","tid":2335897,"uid":44403,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"474c4811cac927159be3180769334715bd654c6f","tid":2335897,"uid":66882,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"f6a96176b571ba917ded1e6056b6bba59f911d9c","tid":2335897,"uid":44403,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T10:47:14.000Z","msg":"其實人類根本就無完全自由意志，從好多Social psy出名嘅實驗都可以得出呢個結論"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T10:52:05.000Z","msg":"Eg?"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T10:57:49.000Z","msg":"最Classical咪Milgram Experiment<br />\n<br />\nThe Milgram experiment(s) on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram.

Participants were led to believe that they were assisting an unrelated experiment, in which they had to administer electric shocks to a &quot;learner.&quot; These fake electric shocks gradually increased to levels that would have been fatal had they been real. The experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of subjects would fully obey the instructions, albeit reluctantly. Milgram first described his research in a 1963 article in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book, Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.m.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMilgram_experiment&d=YgirQyY3AADlg18%2F%2B2KZ%2FVR4K0ufT%2FFGu3kbIPb6xA8%3D&h=7d71c114\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment</a>"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:13:54.000Z","msg":"但係呢個實驗唔係只係指出人類普遍有服從權威嘅傾向咋咩<img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:22:20.000Z","msg":"其實一個實驗嘅design同result係objective嘅，點interpret 係subjective；但至少你見到in this study, participants obey to authority, despite the fact that the instructions received were conflicting with their personal conscience/values，已經反證左佢地既決定唔係100% free will。"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:26:38.000Z","msg":"加上，當electric shocks被要求繼續遞增嘅時候，佢地有得選擇唔繼續服從指示，但點解大部份人都會選擇繼續？都係一個point illustrate if we have total free will"},{"pid":"524b87167a019716a4eb9d17dbb40e5fb1710b7c","tid":2335897,"uid":53876,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"3b7da07b079739d2708c9bd62bd05d9ae88a912a","tid":2335897,"uid":53876,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a81fad69b4cb9a7899662b797bd931bed74a3e3c","tid":2335897,"uid":44403,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"93a58943c81b5b00e29f6d2d23f6b16444b62b31","tid":2335897,"uid":53876,"like":6,"dislike":0,"score":6,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:13:54.000Z","msg":"但係呢個實驗唔係只係指出人類普遍有服從權威嘅傾向咋咩<img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:22:20.000Z","msg":"其實一個實驗嘅design同result係objective嘅，點interpret 係subjective；但至少你見到in this study, participants obey to authority, despite the fact that the instructions received were conflicting with their personal conscience/values，已經反證左佢地既決定唔係100% free will。"},"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:25:55.000Z","msg":"但個結果個60零個%完全服從咋喎，點足以證明係冇free will?<img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:29:26.000Z","msg":"有服從權威嘅傾向點解會代表冇free will, 個邏輯關係喺邊？"},{"pid":"1562718a84721d092113058d6cacb8b215502c72","tid":2335897,"uid":44403,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"3b7da07b079739d2708c9bd62bd05d9ae88a912a","tid":2335897,"uid":53876,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a81fad69b4cb9a7899662b797bd931bed74a3e3c","tid":2335897,"uid":44403,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"93a58943c81b5b00e29f6d2d23f6b16444b62b31","tid":2335897,"uid":53876,"like":6,"dislike":0,"score":6,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:13:54.000Z","msg":"但係呢個實驗唔係只係指出人類普遍有服從權威嘅傾向咋咩<img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:22:20.000Z","msg":"其實一個實驗嘅design同result係objective嘅，點interpret 係subjective；但至少你見到in this study, participants obey to authority, despite the fact that the instructions received were conflicting with their personal conscience/values，已經反證左佢地既決定唔係100% free will。"},"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:25:55.000Z","msg":"但個結果個60零個%完全服從咋喎，點足以證明係冇free will?<img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:29:52.000Z","msg":"你可以咁講嘅，但都證明唔到係有free will"},{"pid":"32586bfc90926e692151e2e3480e16eca07069f3","tid":2335897,"uid":44403,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"524b87167a019716a4eb9d17dbb40e5fb1710b7c","tid":2335897,"uid":53876,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"3b7da07b079739d2708c9bd62bd05d9ae88a912a","tid":2335897,"uid":53876,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a81fad69b4cb9a7899662b797bd931bed74a3e3c","tid":2335897,"uid":44403,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:22:20.000Z","msg":"其實一個實驗嘅design同result係objective嘅，點interpret 係subjective；但至少你見到in this study, participants obey to authority, despite the fact that the instructions received were conflicting with their personal conscience/values，已經反證左佢地既決定唔係100% free will。"},"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:25:55.000Z","msg":"但個結果個60零個%完全服從咋喎，點足以證明係冇free will?<img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:29:26.000Z","msg":"有服從權威嘅傾向點解會代表冇free will, 個邏輯關係喺邊？"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-22T11:34:17.000Z","msg":"Free will is the ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded.
