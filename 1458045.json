The situation has escalated, and on 21 Jul, the Force has allowed triad gangs to attack normal citizen in Yuen Long station. Many described it as terrorist attack. In spite of the warning received previouslu and police observation of some 800 triad gangsters gathering outside the station at the spot, the Force had decided to let gangsters did their work.<br />\n<br />\nAlso, during the course of the past two months, the Force has been observed firing rubber bullet, bean bag bullet, and 40 mm react rounds at the protesters' head while they are attempting to leave the scene, causing many protestors to suffer from severe injury. Things have gotten worse on 11 Aug. The below acts of brutality and attempt of murder were observed on the day:<br />\n<br />\n1. A young girl was shot in the eye by the Force in Tsim Sha Tsui with bean bag bullet, causing ruptured eyeball and complete blindness. This together with many head-shot incidents by the Force, are attempted murder to kill the protestors and silent the public.<br />\n<br />\n2. Firing tear gas inside Kwai Fong and Tai Koo MTR, something strictly forbidden according to the instructions provided by the weapon manufacturer. This could cause fire, and accumulation of tear gas in the station could cause death. The Force has been caught using expired tear gas in their operation, which according to expert could turn into cyanide, and firing into densely populated regions.<br />\n<br />\n3. Torturing surrendered protestors with baton and push protesters down the escalator with an attempt to kill them.<br />\n<br />\n4. Shoting a large crowd of protestors at their heads with bean bag bullet in less than 1 meter of distance in Tai Koo station.<br />\n<br />\n5. Dressed up as protestors and arrested protestors, something forbidden by the law. The Force was also caught by camera planting evidence into protestors' backpack.<br />\n<br />\nThe members in the Force, while attempting the above brutality, were masked. There is no way for general public to know their identity and file lawsuit in the local court against such brutality.<br />\n<br />\nIn this regard, I would like to seek your assistance to instigate investigation into the Hong Kong Police Force of such brutality against humanity.<br />\n<br />\nThank you for your kind attention. I hope by your international impartial status as well as the connection with the UN, you can help us to stop the violence and offences being done by the HK Police, and bring true justice to us.<br />\n<br />\nRegards, <br />\n<br />\nXXXX<br />\nA Hong Kong citizen"},{"pid":"97d29cce068d4afc9a94500dad1cb2560c3e72bb","tid":1458045,"uid":160257,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-12T12:53:59.000Z","msg":"唔識，等識嘅人俾意見<br />\n721 811"},{"pid":"3afda16d8ed608eef585260bf1cada1952950323","tid":1458045,"uid":289846,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"ebae9449df838cba3ea499748fd832187586a083","tid":1458045,"uid":276903,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-12T12:50:39.000Z","msg":"【手動轉】<br />\n<br />\n推！爆！佢！<br />\n<br />\n整咗封email 去國際刑事法院<br />\notp.informationdesk@icc-cpi.int<br />\n要求調查及控告香港警察， 請考慮一齊send！<br />\n（歡迎修改及轉載）<br />\n<br />\nRequest for investigation and prosecution of the HONG KONG POLICE FORCE<br />\n<br />\nDear Sir/Madam,<br />\n<br />\nI would like to request your investigation and prosecution into collusion with triad gangsters, attempted murder, use of chemical weapon (expired tear gas) in MTR, and use of brutal means to attack protestors by the HK Police Force (the &quot;Force&quot;), all of which have been recorded and reported by the local media.<br />\n<br />\nEver since 9 Jun, there has been large scale demonstrations in HK.
