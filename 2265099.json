For months, Joe Biden has consistently and convincingly led Donald Trump in polls. Swing states in the industrial Midwest and Sun Belt appear to be heading Biden&rsquo;s way, and if you trust the polls, it&rsquo;s not a leap to imagine him winning 330+ electoral votes.<br />\n<br />\nBut what if you shouldn&rsquo;t trust the polls?<br />\n<br />\nIn 2016, months of national polls confidently showed Hillary Clinton ahead, and set many Americans up for a shock on Election Night, when the Electoral College tilted decisively in Trump&rsquo;s favor. Two pollsters who weren&rsquo;t blindsided by this are Arie Kapteyn and Robert Cahaly. Kapteyn, a Dutch economist who leads the USC&rsquo;s Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research, oversaw the USC/Los Angeles Times poll that gave Trump a 3-point lead heading into election day&mdash;which, Kapteyn notes, was wrong: Clinton won the popular vote by 2 points. Cahaly, a Republican pollster with the Trafalgar Group, had preelection surveys that showed Trump nudging out Clinton in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and North Carolina&mdash;all of which he won.<br />\nThis year, both men believe that polls could again be undercounting Trump&rsquo;s support. The reason is &ldquo;shy&rdquo; Trump voters&mdash;people reluctant to share their opinions for fear of being judged. Though the &ldquo;shy voter&rdquo; idea is thrown around a lot by both Trump supporters and Democratic skeptics, Kapteyn and Cahaly have specific insights into why, and how, Trump support might be going undetected."},{"pid":"298e88ddbf79e96e388619919423e8dffc7b11a9","tid":2265099,"uid":28114,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-31T07:15:33.000Z","msg":"For Cahaly, those votes are likely to make the difference again. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of hidden Trump votes out there,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Will Biden win the popular vote? Probably. I&rsquo;m not even debating that. <span class=\"red\">But I think Trump is likely to have an Electoral College victory.&rdquo;</span><br />\n<br />\nAs an illustration, Kapteyn described what his team at USC sees in its polls. Beyond simply asking voters whether they support Biden or Trump, USC asks a &ldquo;social-circle&rdquo; question&mdash;&ldquo;Who do you think your friends and neighbors will vote for?&rdquo;&mdash;which some researchers believe makes it easier for people to share their true opinions without fear of being judged for their views.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;We actually get a 10-point lead, nationally, for Biden over Trump&rdquo; when asking voters who they personally plan to support, says Kapteyn. &ldquo;But if you look at the &lsquo;social-circle&rsquo; question, Biden only gets like a 5- or 6-point lead. &hellip; In general&mdash;and certainly on the phone&mdash;people may still be a little hesitant to say to that they&rsquo;re Trump voters.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"red\">&ldquo;We live in a country where people will lie to their accountant, they&rsquo;ll lie to their doctor, they&rsquo;ll lie to their priest,&rdquo; says Cahaly. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re supposed to believe they shed all of that when they get on the telephone with a stranger?&rdquo;</span><br />\n<br />\nThis year, conventional pollsters say they&rsquo;ve learned their lessons, and are accounting for factors that skewed their results last year. Kapteyn and Cahaly aren&rsquo;t so sure, as they explained to POLITICO this week via Zoom. A transcript of that conversation is below, condensed and edited for length and clarity."},{"pid":"b1e9d275561012a39eb55c5959f3d8e08eb1c7dd","tid":2265099,"uid":55917,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-31T07:15:59.000Z","msg":"登登MUST WIN<img src=\"/assets/faces/cat/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/cat/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6dc16f3280ccce33ee62acc1492c9adab8770fb0","tid":2265099,"uid":28114,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-31T07:16:27.000Z","msg":"Election Day is next week. National polling averages show Biden leading Trump by around 9 points. In 2016, averages had Clinton up by around 3 points, but you both ran polls that showed Trump winning the presidency. What do you see this year?<br />\n<br />\nRobert Cahaly, the Trafalgar Group: Well first, we don&rsquo;t do national polls, and that&rsquo;s for the same reason I don&rsquo;t keep up with hits in a baseball game: It&rsquo;s an irrelevant statistic. But the battleground-state polls are a little closer [than the national polls], and there&rsquo;s a lot at play. People are going to be shocked. A lot of people are going to vote this year who have been dormant or low-propensity voters. I think it&rsquo;s going to be at an all-time high.<br />\n<br />\nThe models of who&rsquo;s going to turn out this year are very flawed. What type of person comes out for Trump? They&rsquo;re not a normal election participant. They&rsquo;re a low-propensity voter. We included them in all of our surveys in fall 2016, and we are including them now.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;People are going to be shocked. A lot of people are going to vote this year who have been dormant or low-propensity voters. I think it&rsquo;s going to be at an all-time high.&rdquo;<br />\n Robert Cahaly<br />\nRelying on live callers for polls is especially bad in this modern era, where &ldquo;social desirability bias&rdquo; is in full play. People avoid awkward conversations. So when a person you don&rsquo;t know calls and asks how you feel about Donald Trump&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t know how they feel&mdash;you tend to give them an answer that you think will make them look at you in the best light. We&rsquo;ve seen it year after year, and I think it is very much at play this year."},{"pid":"fa7ca76b28439adebde5076fa4fcf62c0500f141","tid":2265099,"uid":28114,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-31T07:17:33.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/29/2020-polls-trump-biden-prediction-accurate-2016-433619\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fnews%2Fmagazine%2F2020%2F10%2F29%2F2020-polls-trump-biden-prediction-accurate-2016-433619&d=DHxvyfXarR7adKHN0Usak5SOxZpZ29aBESoBY3kI%2Fuw%3D&h=4c34706e\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/29/2020-polls-trump-biden-prediction-accurate-2016-433619</a><br />\n<br />\n長到ok，自己入去睇<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c45d2a4c6bab225bd299d8430d73478ac970c773","tid":2265099,"uid":273218,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-31T07:18:10.000Z","msg":"Democrat民調即係cctvb 同民建聯民調"},{"pid":"4790caaacd250f5c91b27cdf3e979300f9b1e6bd","tid":2265099,"uid":270220,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"quote":{"pid":"c45d2a4c6bab225bd299d8430d73478ac970c773","tid":2265099,"uid":273218,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-31T07:18:10.000Z","msg":"Democrat民調即係cctvb 同民建聯民調"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-31T07:19:21.000Z","msg":"文匯報問你都cut線<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/nope.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ae03a85755b4aa842d4b8f542282ff2d0ac3214d","tid":2265099,"uid":2054,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"fa7ca76b28439adebde5076fa4fcf62c0500f141","tid":2265099,"uid":28114,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-31T07:17:33.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/29/2020-polls-trump-biden-prediction-accurate-2016-433619\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fnews%2Fmagazine%2F2020%2F10%2F29%2F2020-polls-trump-biden-prediction-accurate-2016-433619&d=DHxvyfXarR7adKHN0Usak5SOxZpZ29aBESoBY3kI%2Fuw%3D&h=4c34706e\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/29/2020-polls-trump-biden-prediction-accurate-2016-433619</a><br />\n<br />\n長到ok，自己入去睇<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-31T07:20:36.000Z","msg":"有幾ok<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"fad2576d4be51ceee43de8455cb6da39b0a71da0","tid":2265099,"uid":230594,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-31T10:02:15.000Z","msg":"TLNR<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
