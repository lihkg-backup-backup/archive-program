By Chapman Chen, HKBNews<br />\n今日（八月三日），香港大批示威人士由旺角遊行至尖沙嘴，有後生男勇士揮美國旗。記者問：為何舉美國旗？勇士答：這面旗代表自由民主正義，記者問：有無人話你勾結外國勢力？勇士答：無人指使我。記者問：怕唔怕揸美國旗會被警察毆多幾棍？死都唔驚，何況被克警毆多幾棍！On Aug. 3, a large group of Hong Kong dissidents marched from Mongkok to Tsim Sha Tsui protesting for universal suffrage and against police brutality. A young male therein was waving an American flag. When asked why he should hold it, the young man replied, &quot;This flag represents freedom, democracy and righteousness.&quot; When asked whether anybody had accused him of colluding with foreign forces, he said, &quot;No one has put me up to it.&quot; When asked if he was worried that he would be hit even harder by the HK Police for holding such a flag, the dissident asserted, &quot;I fear not even death, let alone being hit harder by the dirty cops!&quot; <br />\n<br />\nFB link: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/742487356189031?__tn__=-R\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhongkongbilingualnews%2Fposts%2F742487356189031%3F__tn__%3D-R&d=DXsCe6mrroMB06wP0eqGVUZZ0ArqIWVBMBEeODt8eII%3D&h=fe3b6847\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/742487356189031?__tn__=-R</a> <br />\n<br />\nWeb LINK: <a href=\"https://www.hongkongbilingualnews.com/post/%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E6%97%97%E5%8B%87%E5%A3%AB%E5%BF%83%E8%81%B2-what-a-hong-kong-protester-with-a-usa-flag-thinks-by-chapman-chen-hkbnews\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hongkongbilingualnews.com%2Fpost%2F%25E7%25BE%258E%25E5%259C%258B%25E6%2597%2597%25E5%258B%2587%25E5%25A3%25AB%25E5%25BF%2583%25E8%2581%25B2-what-a-hong-kong-protester-with-a-usa-flag-thinks-by-chapman-chen-hkbnews&d=DXsCe6mrroMB06wP0eqGVUZZ0ArqIWVBMBEeODt8eII%3D&h=0cbc7031\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.hongkongbilingualnews.com/post/%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E6%97%97%E5%8B%87%E5%A3%AB%E5%BF%83%E8%81%B2-what-a-hong-kong-protester-with-a-usa-flag-thinks-by-chapman-chen-hkbnews</a><br />\n<br />\n#extraditionlaw #ccp #communistchina #makeamericagreatagain #donaldtrump #maga2020 #hongkongpolicebrutality"},{"pid":"92872fad04f05e2cf8b6ec2aeef4b0e7b655d34b","tid":1401185,"uid":19218,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-03T14:28:12.000Z","msg":"on9<br />\n俾位人入<br />\n呢面旗好撚礙眼"}]}
