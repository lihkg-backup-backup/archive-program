It's well accepted that niacinamide can combine with any ingredient for the skin and only enhance it. Your post about Retinol being rendered useless by adding acids (like hydroxy or ascorbic acid) is wrong too. Heck, Roc, the leading manufacturer of Retinol, puts ascorbic acid in their day moisturizer. I could go on and on, but what's the use. I am done, and rely on my dermatologist and clinical studies to get accurate info. Shame on you.<br />\n<br />\nJJ  Ella Darling &bull; a year ago<br />\nI completely agree with you that Futurederm does NOT know what she is talking about regarding this topic. The research articles she cites are completely outdated and did not use stabilized formulations. With the way modern technology has advanced, skincare has completely changed and there is no longer any further concern with niacinamide and ascorbic acid interacting with each other whether they are both in the same product or if they are layered on as separate products. Even in the studies Futurederm cites, she neglects to mention that the amount of niacinamide/ascorbic acid deteriorating is so small that your skin wouldn't even know the difference. This article should be taken down.<br />\n <br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/25.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"887e75d7e99a1abd6df235da0bb19cc6158101b2","tid":389665,"uid":52539,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-09-07T16:54:06.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/23.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ac0df51cfa0f5e7e1ebabb12098560931932858d","tid":389665,"uid":52539,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-09-09T14:16:17.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/02.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"12ab05956d056cd334bd83ff79f160771ba84cea","tid":389665,"uid":52539,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-22T03:49:34.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/09.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
