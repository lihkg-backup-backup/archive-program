Hong Kong is a part of China but operates under &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot; which basically means it supposedly has a high degree of autonomy. We have our own little constitution called the Basic Law which stipulates that Chinese laws cannot be applied to Hong Kong. <br />\n<br />\nFor more background information, and ease of reference, this article provides a good short overview of the proposed bill: <a href=\"https://qz.com/1635504/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hong-kongs-extradition-law/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1635504%2Feverything-you-need-to-know-about-hong-kongs-extradition-law%2F&d=NXUP4IJ4la%2FJDnFlXEjtWExj1a1M9JfR6d2dSWReNkw%3D&h=4969c1c4\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://qz.com/1635504/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hong-kongs-extradition-law/</a><br />\n<br />\nTo put it very simply, the bill is a serious derogation of the rule of law and the arrangement of One Country Two Systems because it subjects all those in Hong Kong to the weak legal system in China. Over the past three months, many professionals including the legal field has expressed doubt and criticism for the amendment but the government has simply ignored everyone. <br />\n<br />\nOn 9 June (Sunday), over 1.03 million citizens went on the streets to express their objections though a march, this is important because Hong Kong's population is 7.23 million people, which means around 15% of the population took to the streets to express their concerns. The government ignored everyone and decided to proceed with the second reading of the bill (after completely skipping the bills committee which scrutinises the amendment clause by clause) on 12 June 2019.<br />\n<br />\nOn 12 June (Wednesday), the citizens of Hong Kong decided to go for &quot;picnics&quot; outside the lawn area of the Legislative Council and government headquarters. There were thousands and thousands of people who showed up, majority being students and young people and this soon overflowed to neighbouring areas and road blockades. It was an extremely peaceful ordeal on the part of the picnic-ers as seen in this video: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HKallies/videos/vb.461674323909925/883501851982532/?type=2&amp;theater.\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FHKallies%2Fvideos%2Fvb.461674323909925%2F883501851982532%2F%3Ftype%3D2%26theater.&d=NXUP4IJ4la%2FJDnFlXEjtWExj1a1M9JfR6d2dSWReNkw%3D&h=f41bc43d\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/HKallies/videos/vb.461674323909925/883501851982532/?type=2&amp;theater.</a> However, after 4pm local time, the police unleashed brutal force on the protestors. Police were seen abusing their power by firing at unarmed and innocent young people with rubber bullets as well as continuously dropping tear gas bombs. They beat peaceful protesters and shouted at them using provocative language. Some even celebrated their &ldquo;victory&rdquo; against the citizens. They called it a riot, a supposed state of emergency when the only people provoking this violence was the police themselves. They stopped ambulances from entering the zone and providing necessary help. They have alleged that protestors threw bricks at the police, this did not happen. Protestors did not instigate any sort of violence. Our Chief Executive (leader) has refused to back down but if this bill goes through, everything we stand for in Hong Kong will no longer remain. Please refer to @godblesshk for images on the incident for context.<br />\n<br />\nThis was the most disheartening day in the history of Hong Kong. There was bloodshed. There was violence. We were betrayed by those who vowed to protect us.  We were treated like rioters despite having done nothing violent. We might be a small city but we stand as one during this difficult time. We need help getting exposure. We urge the rest of the world pay attention to this incident happening in Hong Kong because this is a fight for our basic rights and freedoms: the right to protest, freedom of speech, freedom of press, etc. <br />\n<br />\nWe know this is a long shot, Hasan, but the young people of Hong Kong could really use your help."},{"pid":"fcb1e35fc431df368e3dd1513a00dfcf3c7d1464","tid":1215068,"uid":243092,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-13T07:33:03.000Z","msg":"1推"},{"pid":"6a01e8c868858246552652dbcaeec256096dd0cb","tid":1215068,"uid":211347,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-14T03:37:44.000Z","msg":"/呢個聯署，真係一定要join，同埋推俾多d人<br />\n<br />\n原來林鄭係 2015 年獲頒法國最高榮譽 Officer of the Legion of Honor，表揚佢作為一個「模範政治領導人和公僕」既工作，同埋佢對於法國係香港既經濟及文化活動既支持。四年後既今日我相信大家聽落去都覺嘔心。而法國Legion of Honor寫到明話如果有人得到呢個榮譽後做一D違背法國支持既理念（如自由，人權）既野，佢可以被取消資格的。請大家聯署，要求法國當局取消林鄭呢個榮譽。自由，平等同博愛，佢配唔起！//<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1094495067293073/permalink/2274131519329416?sfns=mo\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroups%2F1094495067293073%2Fpermalink%2F2274131519329416%3Fsfns%3Dmo&d=NXUP4IJ4la%2FJDnFlXEjtWExj1a1M9JfR6d2dSWReNkw%3D&h=bdd42c53\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1094495067293073/permalink/2274131519329416?sfns=mo</a>"},{"pid":"916e41cfcb335e618ccc86b62ad18b536f621c1f","tid":1215068,"uid":211347,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-14T03:38:05.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
