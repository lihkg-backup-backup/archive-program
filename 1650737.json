Did Lam learn anything at all from the political storm she caused with her disastrous bill? Most would agree she didn&rsquo;t, yet she still has the gall to repeatedly demand an end to the violence.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The ongoing violence didn&rsquo;t suddenly spring out of thin air. It is a direct result of Lam&rsquo;s many political blunders. Maybe she has forgotten violence came only after she ignored mass peaceful protests. Lam is known for mouthing absurdities. Remember when she said protesters had no stake in society?&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;She upped her absurdity last Saturday by saying Friday&rsquo;s city-wide rampage proved a mask ban was necessary. Is she living in a parallel universe? Her mask ban sparked the rampage, for goodness sake. Lam wants an end to violence so Hong Kong can return to its former normal.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"c89a7b97a58387a0b6b9616b9b4979b2e160264b","tid":1650737,"uid":127177,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-13T06:30:51.000Z","msg":"There is a conspiracy that Lam is not actually the one who gives order.
