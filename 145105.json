Apple was rumored to have talked with Time Warner about an acquisition before AT&amp;T closed that deal, and it seems like Apple is once again considering buying a production studio rather than just buying TV content. However, no one is sure what to expect because of the aforementioned competition within the company. <br />\n<br />\nNot only does that competition make it unclear what Apple's plans are, it also implies that even Apple doesn't know what path it should take. That makes any potential deal less likely, but not out of the realm of possibility. Of course, there's also the issue that Apple has always been a hardware and software company, and although it has excelled at distributing media, actually being a content creator is a very different business. Acquiring the talent to make that work would be better than Apple thinking it could do it alone, but it's unclear if such a move would add to Apple's business or simply pull focus from the hardware and software businesses."},{"pid":"9012261a26635586684d66d417ae54d628c5e7a4","tid":145105,"uid":68094,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-06T04:03:42.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"0c36f457933d950389577279349f282e05218816","tid":145105,"uid":50872,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-06T04:07:04.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>Apple越行越遠<br />\n<br />\nappleTV 這個興趣，遲早害死APPLE</blockquote><br />\n<br />\n唔通成世靠iphone食老本咩<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n唔發展其他又話人地死硬<br />\n發展其他又話人越行越遠<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"01ab8fc46513bb759202a281ab36926ee65652bf","tid":145105,"uid":40867,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-06T04:08:10.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>Apple越行越遠<br />\n<br />\nappleTV 這個興趣，遲早害死APPLE</blockquote><br />\n放長雙眼睇<br />\n當初搞itunes都係咁講<br />\n<br />\niDog <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8ac35f4b42bebb9dbd65779e7083d72efc3a28b9","tid":145105,"uid":81397,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-06T05:27:22.000Z","msg":"本身想買wb"},{"pid":"6e6bf8dd958a22e5cc9293f24bc1c30cd5cf7bfa","tid":145105,"uid":39628,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-06T05:45:37.000Z","msg":"有錢就身痕ga la<br />\n鬼叫佢真係好多錢.....<br />\n真係吹佢唔脹"},{"pid":"46c85e7614451c56c975a7573a811b8f83c2af19","tid":145105,"uid":81397,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-06T05:48:14.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>有錢就身痕ga la<br />\n鬼叫佢真係好多錢.....<br />\n真係吹佢唔脹</blockquote><br />\n1000億，收曬6大都無問題"},{"pid":"5b76ae91d53184b3f948404948f2f24bf6d677a3","tid":145105,"uid":85052,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-06T06:02:33.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>Apple越行越遠<br />\n<br />\nappleTV 這個興趣，遲早害死APPLE</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nApple 無可能賣足成世iPhone架大佬<br />\n趁iPhone 仲可以吊命嘅時候 <br />\n拎啲錢去其他地方投資好平常啫"},{"pid":"7dc858a6526b16e79782b9cf12d257d33431a4d6","tid":145105,"uid":8410,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-06T06:04:10.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><blockquote>Apple越行越遠<br />\n<br />\nappleTV 這個興趣，遲早害死APPLE</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nApple 無可能賣足成世iPhone架大佬<br />\n趁iPhone 仲可以吊命嘅時候 <br />\n拎啲錢去其他地方投資好平常啫</blockquote><br />\n<br />\n不過投資的眼光就...<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1bac0ed20f201d9e8b143c59630dc6e23c60faaf","tid":145105,"uid":25612,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-06T06:05:34.000Z","msg":"其實以前Apple定位喺Audio唔明點解唔自己整個Hi-res耳機brand出黎，要收購垃圾Beat"},{"pid":"6176d626c9d05e8bd91c070bc9ea9a4861726d36","tid":145105,"uid":24345,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-06T06:15:08.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>其實以前Apple定位喺Audio唔明點解唔自己整個Hi-res耳機brand出黎，要收購垃圾Beat</blockquote><br />\n垃圾quality 賣幾千<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 老閪都要"},{"pid":"81b0b4308dda096f24a47fc0b4b4a7a184a43717","tid":145105,"uid":81397,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-06T06:28:02.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><blockquote>其實以前Apple定位喺Audio唔明點解唔自己整個Hi-res耳機brand出黎，要收購垃圾Beat</blockquote><br />\n垃圾quality 賣幾千<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 老閪都要</blockquote><br />\nApple 收購Beat 係想要個music steaming同果班人手，耳機只係附送，<br />\n<br />\n好似而家Sony影業最吸引Apple係AMC，電影反而係其次"}]}
