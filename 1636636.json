They suppose to know the laws since they have the authority to arrest citizens violating the law and regulations. But obviously, they DON&rsquo;T HAVE THE SENSE OF COMPLYING WITH THE LAW. When the police are the ones who violate the law, who are going to arrest them? They won&rsquo;t got arrested, be prosecuted, thus they don&rsquo;t have to bear any responsibility for their brutality. Instead, protestors are taking the risk of being prosecuted, and even getting hurt in the police station.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Then, you have to know who they are attacking.</span></strong></span><br />\n<br />\nProtestors: police, pro-BeiJing citizens and shops<br />\nPolice: all citizens<br />\n<br />\nFor protestors, they are attacking at those who don&rsquo;t agree with their opinion and ATTACK THEM FIRST. They won&rsquo;t attack innocent people, or even pro-govt supporters who do nothing on them.<br />\nHowever, there are cases which police arrest and attack youngsters without any proper reason(eg a teen got caught since he has two octopus cards^).

Protestors are obviously not aiming for any money or luxurious products as they don&rsquo;t get anything from the shops. Instead, they are just expressing their anger in a violent way. Why are they using violence is because of the government&rsquo;s ignorance on their demands when they express the 5 demands peacefully. On the other hand, police are undoubtedly using excessive violence to suspect and they even killed citizens during and after protests. Some of the victims are believed to be innocent as the police attack all people on the train back to 31 Aug, one of the darkest days in Hong Kong. Though there are no official evidence of death provided by the government, there are many suspicious and weirdly many cases of committing suicide. The details can refer to related articles and post about &ldquo;831 terrorist attack in Hong Kong&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nPlease think carefully on the following questions:<br />\n- if the protestors are really violent, why don&rsquo;t they start destroying pro-govt or china-based shops and supporters since June? <br />\n- protestors&rsquo; violence and police brutality, which one brings larger
