Our city has been heavily polluted by tear gas. <br />\n<br />\nYou may have noticed from news reports that since protests started in June, the police have used more than 10,000 canisters of tear gas in this densely populated city.<br />\n<br />\nThis poses a huge public health danger.<br />\n<br />\nIn the short run, those on the frontline, including journalists, bear a huge risk of developing respiratory diseases. As the police fire the canisters indiscriminately, innocent passers-by and even babies have been attacked.<br />\n<br />\nIn the long run, the city is polluted. The water system may have been contaminated. There are also talks of carcinogenic dioxins, which have a half-life of many years, may have accumulated in different parts of the city."},{"pid":"17fef767e89fb63ebdf5eb068a61602b0ee7b31e","tid":1780265,"uid":266088,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T08:34:51.000Z","msg":"Needless to say, the government has refused to conduct an independent inquiry into the issue, and  publicise relevant safety data. Even the environmental bureau does not reveal the composition of those canisters. We don&rsquo;t even know what we are inhaling every day.<br />\n<br />\nSimilar to global warming, this crisis is human made and arises from irresponsibility of those in power. The difference is that we are already suffering now, rather than a few decades later. This is therefore an even more immediate issue to us living here.<br />\n<br />\nIn this regard, we appeal for your support for Hong Kong. Your moral authority on the issue of environmental issues would assist us in ensuring that we and our descendants can live in a environmentally decent environment.<br />\n<br />\nAny form of support is welcome. You may speak on the issue in international forums, urge international bodies such as the World Health Organisation to study this public health crisis, and even visit us in person. Should you express your interest, we are sure many of us in Hong Kong would line up to help.<br />\n<br />\nMay we hope that we all live in an environmentally friendly world where those in power are held responsible for their crimes and those who work hard are entitled to a clean and sustainable world to live in.<br />\n<br />\nBest regards,<br />\nHong Kong citizens"},{"pid":"1aec3e0175b2e0f3594e7cabe885047d007b1234","tid":1780265,"uid":265192,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T08:39:37.000Z","msg":"香港人一直支持，並且身體力行實踐環保。我地熱愛我地既地球，但缺乏政治權利，令香港人都冇辦法將環保理念係社會既層面實踐。因為欠缺民主同公民權利，令香港既環保運動停滯不前。<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/4KWUV6B.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2F4KWUV6B.jpg&h=7e13195d&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"6abae64710c2be2a85f1493d9ea7ae5e9c69f89c","tid":1780265,"uid":165683,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T08:41:06.000Z","msg":"見twitter有環保撚反駁 因為中國為全球生產所以高污染 <br />\n所以要理左美國先<br />\n<br />\n歐美長期為國內工廠訂立高環保標準<br />\n並沒有為進軍中國貨訂立環保標準<br />\n導致工廠成本比中國高<br />\n最終令產品於中國生產<br />\n造成輸出性污染<br />\n<br />\n就此建議 歐美應為進口貨訂立環保標準 <br />\n否則應納環保稅<br />\n今中國人民唔洗受污染之苦<br />\n<br />\n中國工人有福了"},{"pid":"b1961c1adc243de53e1036bafb50efd42d4213e0","tid":1780265,"uid":266088,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T08:42:11.000Z","msg":"從香港給環保少女Greta Thunberg的信<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1780265\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1780265</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"4fe5e9ec74c7a81b2a98890b37ec7d49395cbb62","tid":1780265,"uid":336896,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T08:46:55.000Z","msg":"寫得好好，但你要知道，佢背後嘅團體，<br />\n只係關心climate change，不妨加多句，<br />\n我地邀請你來香港參觀，<br />\n甚至可以贊助佢搭帆船或西伯利亞火車，<br />\n希望你觀察中國的問題，<br />\n中國是碳排放最高國家，<br />\n未來更會繼續大量建造燒煤炭的發電廠，<br />\n中國係導致溫室效應最嚴重嘅國家。<br />\n咁樣先至會擊中要害，令佢必須回應。"},{"pid":"b46c83bf2f445bb5b35eee519ee7febe264635c4","tid":1780265,"uid":266088,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"4fe5e9ec74c7a81b2a98890b37ec7d49395cbb62","tid":1780265,"uid":336896,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T08:46:55.000Z","msg":"寫得好好，但你要知道，佢背後嘅團體，<br />\n只係關心climate change，不妨加多句，<br />\n我地邀請你來香港參觀，<br />\n甚至可以贊助佢搭帆船或西伯利亞火車，<br />\n希望你觀察中國的問題，<br />\n中國是碳排放最高國家，<br />\n未來更會繼續大量建造燒煤炭的發電廠，<br />\n中國係導致溫室效應最嚴重嘅國家。<br />\n咁樣先至會擊中要害，令佢必須回應。"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T09:00:24.000Z","msg":"多謝提議，有冇更多意見<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"556bf338b29afd1acce48f0555de0f53ee26f816","tid":1780265,"uid":60916,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T09:02:44.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"1c2e1f118c2b0d061f861a98f13bb364c101dccb","tid":1780265,"uid":266088,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T09:15:08.000Z","msg":"環保撚入<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"af0606b314ed58a0600b54a71c6c0c37a62215de","tid":1780265,"uid":33293,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T10:26:25.000Z","msg":"推推，傑出的一手"},{"pid":"59d4d8ffbda9385a6f3ffc035684b1539cdd4b7e","tid":1780265,"uid":266088,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T10:36:47.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8b5db8f0bf0e2478af44b36c9758d021e643a3b0","tid":1780265,"uid":53254,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T11:05:32.000Z","msg":"上個封面俾全港撚狗<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4240bdb9ca2ec149e454aa4ee183e456d44ee12b","tid":1780265,"uid":114781,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T11:18:02.000Z","msg":"快d上twitter恭喜佢同邀請佢關注下香港催淚彈毒煙同支那第一污染物排放量<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/sowhat.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"bb092e6f6b796fd5d1939465ed5644316bacf654","tid":1780265,"uid":266088,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T11:55:13.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"836cb6dd9f3e5dfd952fea84c3f447e01cbc2e6d","tid":1780265,"uid":266088,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-12T12:25:23.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"153cadd935b45ede89b01acaf8037126162b7804","tid":1780265,"uid":266088,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-13T05:21:10.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
