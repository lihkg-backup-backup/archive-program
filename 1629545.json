The People's Republic of China claims Taiwan as one of its provinces and does not recognize it as an independent country.<br />\n<br />\nWhen Hong Kong and Macau users updated to iOS 13.1.1 or above, the emoji for the Republic of China flag, or Taiwan's flag, disappeared from the emoji keyboard. The iOS 13.1.1 rolled out at the end of September.<br />\n<br />\nPreviously, the Taiwan flag emoji was already not present for iPhones in mainland China. An article on the Apple blog Hiraku says that any device model with the &quot;CN&quot; or &quot;ZA&quot; region, meaning China and Hong Kong, will not be able to use the Taiwan flag emoji.
