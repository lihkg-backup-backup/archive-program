In a similar vein, in Chan Kin Sum Simon v Secretary for Justice &amp; Another (unrep, HCAL 79, 82, 83/2008; 11 March 2009) at &sect;64, A Cheung J explained the effect of a suspension order as follows:<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo; &hellip; in continuing to do what it used to do in accordance with the statutory provisions that have been successfully challenged, the relevant Government official will not be acting in contravention of an operative declaration and risk committing a contempt of court for so acting, which would have been the case if there had been no suspension. <span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\">However, it does not mean that the Government and the official concerned will not be acting contrary to law</span></span>. For regardless of whether there is an operative declaration, the Court&rsquo;s judgment in which it is held that the offending provisions are unconstitutional constitutes, by definition, part of the common law of Hong Kong. The ratio decidendi of the decision of the Court constitutes part of the case law of Hong Kong. <span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\">To continue acting as before, the Government and its official would be acting contrary to the common law of Hong Kong as decided by the Court. So regardless of whether there is any operative declaration, by acting contrary to the common law as held by the Court, the Government and its official would be acting contrary to law and incurring legal liability as a result. </span></span> The temporary suspension of the declaration of unconstitutionality only prevents the Government from acting in contravention of a declaration in operation and removes the risk of the Government official&rsquo;s action amounting to a contempt of court, which is an even more serious matter than acting contrary to the law (including common law) of Hong Kong.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n...<br />\n<br />\n37.  For these reasons, we decline to make any temporary validity order or suspension order.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n麻煩大家學習下讀判詞之後會決定屌唔屌啦好嗎<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8d64dbe39f9c127686ccf7f759e0a9c1e6306d6a","tid":1745687,"uid":112878,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-22T10:54:47.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"9eb79041967d4fc036fa9d451cb5f3ca4b67cab7","tid":1745687,"uid":86027,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-22T10:54:53.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f4699d6cebd1af742c1157a238b40f48cd2ad2a5","tid":1745687,"uid":86027,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-22T10:58:40.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"2289169c775ee735bc1a9bf468387ca35533f5b4","tid":1745687,"uid":235025,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-22T11:00:25.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"a9c98cadfa518fe2458a3eb4088a3e1cfa7e7e46","tid":1745687,"uid":158613,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-22T11:01:54.000Z","msg":"含啦"},{"pid":"2baed928abf679e8145cc6a46c95a989e9e6ebb7","tid":1745687,"uid":86027,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-22T11:03:50.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ec85ae9eebacc3718e1a596826e3d16e63b40f2c","tid":1745687,"uid":130797,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-22T11:04:19.000Z","msg":"引用返之前有個巴打既比喻<br />\n<br />\n雖然你強姦係犯法<br />\n不過暫時容許你繼續抽插到月尾先<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"269a633112d055f91d6bbb22b0e529720765faf0","tid":1745687,"uid":55598,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-22T11:05:35.000Z","msg":"3. We should also make it clear, lest there be any doubt, that pending the appellate process, there is inherent in our system always an uncertainty whether the lower court&rsquo;s judgment will be affirmed or reversed. If a judgment declaring a law to be invalid is reversed on appeal, the effect is that the law has always been valid, and persons who have acted contrary to it during the intervening period may find themselves to have breached that law and to have to bear the consequences. Our Judgment is not intended to give, and cannot be taken as, any encouragement for any person to use face covering in the situations covered by the PFCR."}]}
