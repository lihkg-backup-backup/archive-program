A lot of times people talk about, they had 2,000 people but it was really 1,000 or it was 200. I see it all the time &hellip; but when you look at this demonstration, they said it was a million people. That was a million people,&rdquo; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;That was as big a demonstration as I&rsquo;ve ever seen, so I hope it all works out for China and for Hong Kong,&rdquo; he continued.<br />\nAsked if protesters are sending a message to China with these demonstrations, Trump said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re sending them. That&rsquo;s a demonstration that they&rsquo;re having. I understand the reason for the demonstration, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll be able to work it out. I hope they&rsquo;ll be able to work it out with China.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nAt least 72 people have been injured in Hong Kong protests over the bill.<br />\n<br />\nThe proposed law would allow Hong Kong to extradite fugitives to territories where it doesn't have formal extradition deals, including mainland China, Taiwan and Macau.<br />\n<br />\nOpponents of the bill say it could mean democracy activists, journalists and foreign business owners could be surrendered to mainland China.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/hong-kong-protests-june-12-intl-hnk/index.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fedition.cnn.com%2Fasia%2Flive-news%2Fhong-kong-protests-june-12-intl-hnk%2Findex.html&d=0lytrcPBTEnksf4YR0ybMUzY%2BUnkXQH0zW%2FJu7eEK44%3D&h=0caff070\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fedition.cnn.com%2Fasia%2Flive-news%2Fhong-kong-protests-june-12-intl-hnk%2Findex.html&h=eb2ffb20\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/hong-kong-protests-june-12-intl-hnk/index.html</a>"}]}
