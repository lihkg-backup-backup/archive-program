Afterwards I doorstopped the DPRK colonel, asking how we could really tell the tunnels had been destroyed. He said we had seen with our own eyes the sort of explosion produced.<br />\n<br />\nKept asking questions but he didn&rsquo;t give detail. You can see full exchange on @skynews. There are many questions about verification unanswered. But I think the main impact of &lsquo;closing&rsquo; Punggy-re is in the putting these sorts of images out very publically<br />\n<br />\n<strong>It&rsquo;s easy enough for DPRK to make another test site. It&rsquo;s also easy enough for us to tell if they test another weapon. Important thing was this as statement of intention - and the about face it would be if DPRK restarted testing.<br />\n</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/JuK-_SFrQhE\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FJuK-_SFrQhE&d=svrvB11%2FOjkRJrQQYRknZ4M9LuuOiGKVuJxWWRW4JEQ%3D&h=feab0bec\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/JuK-_SFrQhE</a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/chesh\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fchesh&d=svrvB11%2FOjkRJrQQYRknZ4M9LuuOiGKVuJxWWRW4JEQ%3D&h=081b6f63\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/chesh</a>"},{"pid":"18dd5c8d553a7adbdce271102a2f2b2de617e900","tid":681366,"uid":34103,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-05-28T03:38:39.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"9c14dfb6fdd1b4b8831e8e72c750710660816642","tid":681366,"uid":68094,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-28T03:53:54.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"}]}
