On trade, Buttigieg is more conciliatory than Warren, but on ideology, Buttigieg&rsquo;s stance is more aggressive than Warren&rsquo;s. The mayor has left room for cooperation with China in his public statements, but his belief that the US and China are in an ideological conflict will most likely lead to increased tensions."}]}
