Because Hong Kong is something that&rsquo;s very visible in Europe.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">&ldquo;This is more serious than the trade talks,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;If you want to know what could tip you into a worldwide recession, it is just a shutdown of Hong Kong,&rdquo; a major financial hub in Asia.</span></strong></span><br />\n<br />\nProtesters in Hong Kong have been rallying since June, at first in opposition of a proposal that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, a measure critics argue would threaten judicial protections. They want Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to officially withdraw the extradition bill from future consideration instead of just saying that the measure is &ldquo;dead.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nDemonstrations, which have morphed into a democracy movement, ramped up on Monday, with about 5,000 protesters flooding Hong Kong International Airport, one of the world&rsquo;s busiest, and leading officials there to cancel flights for the rest of the day.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying the protesters are playing with fire. I think the protesters want fire,&rdquo; Cramer said. &ldquo;This airport needs to be opened for me to feel better about what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; </span></strong></span>The &ldquo;Mad Money&rdquo; host has been saying since last week that the unrest in Hong Kong is his biggest worry for markets.<br />\n<br />\nCramer said he expects the Chinese government to bring in the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army to quell the crowds, which would have global implications.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Tiananmen Square&rsquo; in Hong Kong, we know this market has to get hit,&rdquo; he said, talking about what could a worst case scenario. In 1989, Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square to break up a mass pro-democracy demonstration, killing what&rsquo;s believed to be at least 10,000 people.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/cramer-hong-kong-protests-more-serious-than-us-china-trade-war.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2019%2F08%2F12%2Fcramer-hong-kong-protests-more-serious-than-us-china-trade-war.html&d=xhW6TUFsNmSNLx%2F%2BVUQDb2%2FWCCUevL1oElw8znUqpaw%3D&h=ff7c0c48\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/cramer-hong-kong-protests-more-serious-than-us-china-trade-war.html</a><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">去機場方向正確<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></span></strong></span>"},{"pid":"a6069d9ff1d9ec7e79f9cafbd009842c77633af9","tid":1461599,"uid":151248,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T08:38:33.000Z","msg":"自推"},{"pid":"c9dcd705b434dd3790805b64cbbc2fa41a68ddde","tid":1461599,"uid":151248,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T08:39:44.000Z","msg":"Pish"},{"pid":"ddb2f79fad1788091dc19ec13c0fac18384d700a","tid":1461599,"uid":151248,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T08:40:26.000Z","msg":"大家放工記住入機場啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f691d54f5582ca5248e913c605ca7f1531955bd7","tid":1461599,"uid":151248,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T10:21:16.000Z","msg":"Pish"},{"pid":"5e5f26f375269602b182ff1595af8e12bde87f17","tid":1461599,"uid":151248,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T10:40:27.000Z","msg":"入機場呀入機場呀<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4ae7984a16bfb6ed01274220400e638e72244abc","tid":1461599,"uid":151248,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T10:40:37.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"fedd30ed6835f4d9e50b3eb16ac8e3057da3dc6f","tid":1461599,"uid":151248,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T11:00:36.000Z","msg":"入機場呀入機場呀<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"87a0de44b53320d2838da36decece7c64979d530","tid":1461599,"uid":151248,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T11:06:09.000Z","msg":"入機場呀入機場呀<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"69e1e2d7d9eb6b8512633403bcca41d9429c349a","tid":1461599,"uid":151248,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T11:50:55.000Z","msg":"入機場呀入機場呀<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
