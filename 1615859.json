Such an incident reflects a major escalation of force. The Hong Kong Police Commissioner has confirmed officially the shooting a few hours later, by claiming the officer has aimed the gun at the young protester's left shoulder. <br />\n<br />\nOn the same day, the Hong Kong Police Force has also confirmed six live rounds were fired at different scenes of clashes. Previously on September 29th, a female journalist from Indonesia was hit by a projectile on Sunday, September 29th, while covering the protest in Wanchai district. It has been confirmed she will lose her eyesight completely on one of her eyes. Ms. Veby Indah's lawyer Michael Vidler of Vidler &amp; Co Solicitors has issued a statement on her behalf. <br />\n<br />\nAlthough projectiles have been fired to warn and disperse the crowd at other protesting scenes, and serious injuries were caused as a result of rubber bullets and beanbags employed by the police, this is the first time a protester was hit with a live round since mid-June. Amnesty International Hong Kong Chapter has previously conducted an investigation on the Hong Kong Police's abuse of power. <br />\n<br />\nThe Hong Kong police officer who pointed his gun and open fired at the young protester, Tsang Chi Kin (曾志健), an 18-year-old secondary school boy's in a very short distance. The New York Times has broken down the incident with the video footage collected from various sources. <br />\n<br />\nThe Hospital Authority said that as of 8 pm (1300 BST) on October 1st, 51 people had been injured across Hong Kong today. Two were in critical condition and two in a serious condition.<br />\n<br />\nAs on October 2nd, 2:59am Eastern Time, the Wall Street Journal reports the condition of the injured teenage boy is undetermined.<br />\n<br />\nPolice also attacked the first aiders and the news reporters.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hong Kong SAR government has turned a blind eye to the heightened police-induced brutality and abuse and continues to refuse citizen's demands for an independent investigation committee to look into the current turmoil.<br />\n<br />\nWe, Hongkongers, are experiencing a humanitarian crisis and we hope to seek your attention and consent in launching an investigation into the current chaotic situation in Hong Kong. With faith in ICC's international, impartial status and connection with the UN, I do believe you are able and willing to save Hong Kong people from the violence caused by the government and police force of the city.<br />\n<br />\nMay justice be upheld.<br />\n<br />\nYours faithfully,<br />\n（<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />請考慮用真名及真EMAIL<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />）<br />\nHong Kong citizens<br />\n<br />\nREFERENCE:<br />\nWall Street Journal <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/student-shot-by-police-in-hong-kong-protest-is-the-bravest-type-cousin-says-11569958133\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fstudent-shot-by-police-in-hong-kong-protest-is-the-bravest-type-cousin-says-11569958133&d=2%2FeNT3TbtuwIHwt2a%2FmQGNgc6rz%2Ba6PLwHdujBQ9FQE%3D&h=5d56faef\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/student-shot-by-police-in-hong-kong-protest-is-the-bravest-type-cousin-says-11569958133</a><br />\n<br />\nNew York Times<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006745719/hong-kong-protester-shot.html?fbclid=IwAR2KVvgb2TVwWSizurZjFyQ6pnJJV3XRAfMNHyT1J0iDvFEnLSnqrtj8WsQ\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Fvideo%2Fworld%2Fasia%2F100000006745719%2Fhong-kong-protester-shot.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2KVvgb2TVwWSizurZjFyQ6pnJJV3XRAfMNHyT1J0iDvFEnLSnqrtj8WsQ&d=2%2FeNT3TbtuwIHwt2a%2FmQGNgc6rz%2Ba6PLwHdujBQ9FQE%3D&h=7aa90c43\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006745719/hong-kong-protester-shot.html?fbclid=IwAR2KVvgb2TVwWSizurZjFyQ6pnJJV3XRAfMNHyT1J0iDvFEnLSnqrtj8WsQ</a><br />\n<br />\nContact of Vidler &amp; Co Solicitors Ms. Veby Indah: Info@vidler-co.com"},{"pid":"1f480c86e98bb0cf40770ba6292516e41587a7d1","tid":1615859,"uid":151313,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T08:32:23.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"10369fd88b9b4f4d7d8344f2648947d72e011594","tid":1615859,"uid":140416,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T08:38:06.000Z","msg":"spam爆個mailbox"},{"pid":"7f1b84069fbb9b4336648cb793f8cdd5a62f236a","tid":1615859,"uid":131622,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T08:57:08.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"bd5ba4b77d1e8975d67b29160797ff826d14a9e2","tid":1615859,"uid":313615,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T09:18:20.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/ZQ5Aefu.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FZQ5Aefu.jpg&h=13d564ff&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"2e957616fb9c172c872867b2638d4e4743eacbb5","tid":1615859,"uid":313615,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T09:26:25.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/qMYYWwr.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FqMYYWwr.jpg&h=5b2131c2&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/mG7CsC4.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FmG7CsC4.jpg&h=7a9a20e2&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/c6yYWwL.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2Fc6yYWwL.jpg&h=09b69093&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"79d58504a4de5783aa3a8a5a63ef9ec1ddd27efc","tid":1615859,"uid":183181,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T09:32:17.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"color: red;\">幫手改咗啲字眼formal啲，內容冇分別，大家可以參考用呢個version<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n改得長咗啲，分兩part post<br />\n</span><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\">Part 1</span></span></strong><br />\nnformation and Evidence Unit<br />\nOffice of the Prosecutor<br />\nPost Office Box 19519<br />\n2500 CM The Hague<br />\nThe Netherlands<br />\n<br />\nE-mail: otp.informationdesk@icc-cpi.int<br />\nFacsimile: +31 70 515 8555<br />\n<br />\nDear Sir / Madam,<br />\n<br />\nI am writing to invite you to investigate and prosecute the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Police Force in relation to their brutal violence in the past 4 months, especially a case of an allegedly &quot;murderous attempt&quot; that happened on 1st October 2019.  <br />\n<br />\nA Hong Kong police officer has attacked an 18-year-old protester with live ammunition at Tsuen Wan district in the afternoon on Tuesday, 1st October 2019.
