The over-55s surveyed said they&rsquo;d put only 16% into stocks.<br />\n<br />\nIn all, the online survey of 430 retail investors found that respondents plan to put a large chunk (37%) of any forthcoming stimulus directly into stocks, which could represent a sizable inflow into the market of $170 billion, Deutsche Bank estimated.<br />\n<br />\nThe report, authored by Deutsche Bank Strategist Jim Reid and Research Associate Raj Bhattacharyya and first published late last month, focused on a growing trend of younger people getting into retail investment.<br />\n<br />\nThe overall sample had nearly equal representation of those under 34 (41%) and 34-54 (37%) and a somewhat smaller share of those over 55 years of age, Deutsche Bank noted. In terms of income distribution, the biggest group was in the $50,000 to 100,000 range (34%), which aligns with the U.S. median income of around $69,000. Most respondents were either employed full-time (59%) or retired (12%).<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/clap.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"70b7bc25c2a5b1daef60a73473e7f5862ac94975","tid":2438428,"uid":311611,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:13:44.000Z","msg":"炒GME?"},{"pid":"377efe048dda8ace57abb0da84a2b2d1b94e0fc7","tid":2438428,"uid":129340,"like":6,"dislike":0,"score":6,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:13:45.000Z","msg":"韭菜<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"3d3275da0b5478a9ad5047645e29d09e641fdcf7","tid":2438428,"uid":36134,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:14:31.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0365c5e3e4ea47b9f11343795b3c6048f8854de7","tid":2438428,"uid":31215,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:14:55.000Z","msg":"sh sh sh sh sh"},{"pid":"f0ac6f7e55b910b67f73445149263e3939f038ca","tid":2438428,"uid":360741,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:15:44.000Z","msg":"炒幣<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ade118ea2c89f48699e6a713bba140d13648245c","tid":2438428,"uid":63934,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:16:41.000Z","msg":"GME<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f44eaa7362d1e984e921b680cb2d3521c69464ae","tid":2438428,"uid":57073,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:17:18.000Z","msg":"Gme<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"2bbc66cde02f5bbdbc7a5f01278a8cb3ce97b83f","tid":2438428,"uid":34213,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:18:03.000Z","msg":"pump it up"},{"pid":"2a9d4fe00731a3dea79d282c720f05e474abf1ef","tid":2438428,"uid":109462,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:18:43.000Z","msg":"4月20號啲大麻股會唔會爆升<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b3ddd934e619501552f81c247c9a0cb67f27a11f","tid":2438428,"uid":366470,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"2a9d4fe00731a3dea79d282c720f05e474abf1ef","tid":2438428,"uid":109462,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:18:43.000Z","msg":"4月20號啲大麻股會唔會爆升<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:49:51.000Z","msg":"有咩大事發生"},{"pid":"6c4860df9a296cefe0c36dd94c32ea2052c20311","tid":2438428,"uid":109462,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"b3ddd934e619501552f81c247c9a0cb67f27a11f","tid":2438428,"uid":366470,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"2a9d4fe00731a3dea79d282c720f05e474abf1ef","tid":2438428,"uid":109462,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:18:43.000Z","msg":"4月20號啲大麻股會唔會爆升<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:49:51.000Z","msg":"有咩大事發生"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:55:33.000Z","msg":"國際大麻日<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"270cd8b026666716444c1becf72a1af92c2040ce","tid":2438428,"uid":89046,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"f0ac6f7e55b910b67f73445149263e3939f038ca","tid":2438428,"uid":360741,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-08T13:15:44.000Z","msg":"炒幣<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-09T02:32:43.000Z","msg":"Dogecoin<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/touch.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5c74ac6ea248996b8c1c979e8ef0bb67f03c981e","tid":2438428,"uid":8308,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-09T02:34:35.000Z","msg":"唔好炒股啦 炒幣啦"}]}
