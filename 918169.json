NASA's Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) lander successfully touched down on the Red Planet after an almost seven-month, 300-million-mile (458-million-kilometer) journey from Earth.<br />\n<br />\nInSight's two-year mission will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed.<br />\n<br />\nInSight launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California May 5. The lander touched down Monday, Nov. 26, near Mars' equator on the western side of a flat, smooth expanse of lava called Elysium Planitia, at 11:52:59 a.m. PST (2:52:59 p.m. EST).<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Today, we successfully landed on Mars for the eighth time in human history,&quot; said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. &quot;InSight will study the interior of Mars and will teach us valuable science as we prepare to send astronauts to the Moon and later to Mars. This accomplishment represents the ingenuity of America and our international partners, and it serves as a testament to the dedication and perseverance of our team. The best of NASA is yet to come, and it is coming soon.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe landing signal was relayed to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, via NASA's two small experimental Mars Cube One (MarCO) CubeSats, which launched on the same rocket as InSight and followed the lander to Mars. They are the first CubeSats sent into deep space. After successfully carrying out a number of communications and in-flight navigation experiments, the twin MarCOs were set in position to receive transmissions during InSight's entry, descent and landing."},{"pid":"cb514698ba7249b6f044e44c4b7e2ad4879177e2","tid":918169,"uid":32511,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-27T04:03:29.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"594951533973c60bda956ac39f46b6f863b3b277","tid":918169,"uid":18012,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-27T04:03:59.000Z","msg":"之前聽講有直播LINK<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d70963322906a1bb53fa074da8679a40fa5c1b52","tid":918169,"uid":71071,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-27T04:54:56.000Z","msg":"上火星先至用十一億美金<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 一條鳩鐵要七百億港紙<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
