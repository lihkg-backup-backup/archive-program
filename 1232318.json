Withdraw the extradition bill! Strike tomorrow!<br />\nStatement from Civil Human Rights Front<br />\n<br />\n1. The Black March today saw the opening of all six lanes from the beginning of the march; due crowd control arrangement in many MTR stations, citizens had to get off at Fortress Hill, North Point, Admiralty or Central Station, etc., and then walk to Victoria Park to start the demonstration. Furthermore, demonstrators filling up Lokhard Road, Gloucester Road and Harcourt Road marks an unprecedented number since 1997!<br />\n<br />\n2. Carrie Lam has refused to apologise till this moment. She thought a suggesting a &ldquo;postponement&rdquo; at the press conference alone could fool the vast citizens and calm down the public rage. Truth is, citizens take to the street again, insisting to demand the withdrawal of the extradition bill and the resignation of Carrie Lam. Facing such public rage, Carrie Lam simply makes apology through a press release, for &ldquo;xxx&rdquo; but not for pushing to pass the bill or police&rsquo;s crackdown on protesters. She even stressed that she would continue to serve the citizens. This is a total insult to and fooling the people who took to the street! Hong Konger will not accept this!<br />\n<br />\n3. The police cracked down the protesters with lethal weapons on June 12 and yet still characterise the protest as riot. The demonstration today totally shows how furious the people are to the violence by the police. CHRF reiterates, the Hong Kong Government, lead by Carrie Lam, must hold accountable for the decision to shoot, retract the characterisation of the protest as riot, drop charges against protesters, and release the arrested persons.<br />\n<br />\n4. June 6 saw 1.03 million citizens taking to the streets. In merely a week, citizens once again show their determination to demand the withdrawal of the extradition bill. CHRF reiterates the follow demands:<br />\n<br />\n1/ complete withdrawal of the extradition bill;<br />\n<br />\n2/ accountability for the decision to shoot;<br />\n<br />\n3/ release of the arrested protesters and withdrawal of all charges;<br />\n<br />\n4/ retraction of characterisation of the protester as riot;<br />\n<br />\n5/ resignation of Carrie Lam.<br />\n<br />\nShould the government refuse to respond, only more HONG Kongers will strike tomorrow; 2 million + 1 citizens will take to the street, until their voices be heard.<br />\n<br />\nJune 16, 2019<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CivilHumanRightsFront/photos/a.517931904920872/2306234302757281?type=3&amp;sfns=mo\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCivilHumanRightsFront%2Fphotos%2Fa.517931904920872%2F2306234302757281%3Ftype%3D3%26sfns%3Dmo&d=xNvf4PJMmDX7L7bksShbPkqdoMPUcUEfVTbHbk%2Bo2EU%3D&h=3ed0bb1d\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/CivilHumanRightsFront/photos/a.517931904920872/2306234302757281?type=3&amp;sfns=mo</a>"},{"pid":"a1694286a701099fc4293395cd650a03fa538dc8","tid":1232318,"uid":47659,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-16T15:09:10.000Z","msg":"推爆"},{"pid":"04fb4a42cc4900dfe8fac36bb79adf55085fc24b","tid":1232318,"uid":28114,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-16T15:10:59.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
