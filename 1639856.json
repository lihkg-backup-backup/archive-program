I know that black shirt/white text is the preferred color scheme. Unfortunately... I'm also told that due to lighting in Staples Arena white shirts will be much more legible on TV and black shirts won't really be visible. What does everyone think about this? Stick with the Morey design, or get a black shirt? Let me know on twitter or by sending me messages here.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/M80hq2t.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FM80hq2t.png&h=4c72ddcf&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/free-hong-kong-tshirts-on-nba-opening-night\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gofundme.com%2Ff%2Ffree-hong-kong-tshirts-on-nba-opening-night&d=cH2nQL%2B7gNVGRZzFZPB6VtC8ckn1nBU%2Fwr2%2FVciPwp8%3D&h=b6cd1040\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.gofundme.com/f/free-hong-kong-tshirts-on-nba-opening-night</a><br />\n<br />\nThe Fundraiser (Sun Lared) is asking for your opinion on the T-Shirt Color.  <br />\n<br />\n<strong>Please pick one:</strong><br />\n<br />\nblack background/white text (same as the picture above) - Thumbs up<br />\nor <br />\nwhite background/black text - Thumbs down"},{"pid":"e38316b36f1cfe7021ecf2e99fd31588b25e25e7","tid":1639856,"uid":56084,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T18:19:47.000Z","msg":"Can we have a performance in the after the second quarter?"},{"pid":"0ca00379ca75f91cac60460fe7c42db13404b02c","tid":1639856,"uid":301277,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"e38316b36f1cfe7021ecf2e99fd31588b25e25e7","tid":1639856,"uid":56084,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T18:19:47.000Z","msg":"Can we have a performance in the after the second quarter?"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T18:33:54.000Z","msg":"I am just one of the donor.
