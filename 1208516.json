This<br />\nlegislation would legitimize and legalize the kidnapping of businessmen,<br />\nbooksellers and anyone that China disagrees with, and imperils the safety of<br />\nthe 85,000 Americans living in Hong Kong.  As Martin Lee, the founder of Hong<br />\nKong&rsquo;s Democratic Party, recently wrote, this bill &lsquo;threatens to destroy<br />\nHong Kong&rsquo;s free society.&rsquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The extradition bill imperils the strong U.S.-Hong Kong relationship that<br />\nhas flourished for two decades. If it passes, the Congress has no choice but<br />\nto reassess whether Hong Kong is &lsquo;sufficiently autonomous&rsquo; under the &lsquo;one<br />\ncountry, two systems&rsquo; framework.  We look forward to the introduction of a<br />\nnew bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in the coming days by<br />\nSenator Rubio, Chairman Jim McGovern and Congressman Chris Smith.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The House stands united with Senator McConnell, the Administration and all<br />\nwho have denounced this dangerous extradition legislation.
