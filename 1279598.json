This CPU spike was caused by a bad software deploy that was rolled back. Once rolled back the service returned to normal operation and all domains using Cloudflare returned to normal traffic levels.<br />\nThis was not an attack (as some have speculated) and we are incredibly sorry that this incident occurred. Internal teams are meeting as I write performing a full post-mortem to understand how this occurred and how we prevent this from ever occurring again.//"},{"pid":"30188c5050902e576d8df1d28c6b795c90748466","tid":1279598,"uid":160494,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-02T17:02:23.000Z","msg":"幫推"},{"pid":"af40704aef31f6ffa87f40b6c815bcdc252acdd2","tid":1279598,"uid":160494,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-02T17:02:40.000Z","msg":"幫推<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7e9761ff8878dc4deee2dbd8356ea4d7fcd97226","tid":1279598,"uid":164970,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-02T17:03:15.000Z","msg":"係中國Ddos攻擊"},{"pid":"78dc320e15d3cf882eb1e1911d86379b2e11967e","tid":1279598,"uid":160494,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-02T17:04:00.000Z","msg":"//Cloudflare outage caused by bad software deploy//"}]}
