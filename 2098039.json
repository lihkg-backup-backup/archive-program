target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_nationality_law</a><br />\n<br />\nBy descent<br />\nWhether a person is a Canadian citizen by descent depends on the legislation at the time of birth. Generally speaking, any person who was born to a parent born or naturalized in Canada who has not actively renounced their Canadian citizenship is a Canadian citizen by descent (known as first generations born abroad), regardless of the time of birth. (Such renunciation of Canadian citizenship is considered valid only if it is addressed to Canadian immigration authorities.) These persons either automatically acquired Canadian citizenship at birth, or on 17 April 2009 or 11 June 2015. A small number of persons who voluntarily obtained Canadian citizenship through special grant programs before 2004 were either retroactively granted citizenship since birth or gained citizenship on the day their application was approved.<br />\n<br />\nCases for children of first generations born abroad (known as second and subsequent generations born abroad) are more complicated. For such persons, only those who were born on or before 16 April 2009 may be Canadian citizens.<br />\n<br />\nCurrent legislation<br />\nUnder Bill C-37 which went into force on 17 April 2009, every person born outside of Canada as the first generation born abroad (i.e., born to a Canadian parent who derives their citizenship from birth or naturalization in Canada) on or after 17 April 2009 is automatically a Canadian citizen by descent at birth.<br />\n<br />\nThe Bill also automatically granted Canadian citizenship, for the first time, to children of former Canadian citizens whose citizenship was restored on that day (which was every person who involuntarily lost Canadian citizenship under the 1947 Act). On 11 June 2015, Bill C-24 further extended the automatic grant to children of British subjects who were born or naturalized in Canada but never acquired Canadian citizenship.

/>\n你仲可以加拿大住3年再去英國，咁多cash無乜需要擔心。"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-09T17:13:10.000Z","msg":"華人比較安全呢個真"},{"pid":"7f3774717601914a2a6012eacab18d53cae00dd9","tid":2098039,"uid":97240,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"bb0d11df7b51e706765a989dd4bab47cd1fda294","tid":2098039,"uid":254593,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"b590e452663d26f710343d443c25c767fc6de579","tid":2098039,"uid":254593,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"3d06b57eb4e463790ef55dd663d0459de575d141","tid":2098039,"uid":271635,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-07-08T23:27:00.000Z","msg":"Cantonese

BCIT for trades, Emily Carr University (for arts and design), Victoria University in Victoria city ( 1.5 hrs ferry from Vancouver), Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo (1.5hr ferry from Vancouver). There are also colleges such as Douglas College and Langara College. These are a few in Vancouver area. <br />\n<br />\n2) BC province is the one of the few that provide zero interest rate student loan. So if Canada's Hong Kong rescue plan for 18-35 is to provide student loans, and easy immigration, zero interest rates is quite attractive to come to BC and study here and eventually work. <br />\n<br />\n3) there is a silly argument that you can't get a job in a different location and is stuck in your university city. In a 比喻， It's like saying one grad from Chinese University at 火炭 and the other grad at Hong Kong university at 西環。So if you live in 火炭 area, you cannot apply for jobs on Hong Kong Island because your university is further away than Hong Kong university at 西環. <br />\n<br />\nIt's true Canada is a big county. If you are talented in successfully completing university and pretty ok social skills, you can apply and get jobs in any city inside Canada. Most employers see you grad is a known Canadian university (we don't have 野雞大學), and you did well in interview, you're hired with 3 months trial. <br />\n<br />\nThe only advantage of location is this. You normally try to apply for jobs in your home city before another province, so local employers have an advantage of hiring the fresh grads and new talent. <br />\n<br />\nUsually as a new grad, you will accept a good job even if it requires you to move. My first job after grad is in... Japan (for fun) and then a more serious government work in small town of 13000 people in the north. It took a few years to make it back to Vancouver area. <br />\n<br />\nOne of my sister grad as engineer at University of Waterloo and needed to move to Saskatoon to a work in a mine. <br />\n<br />\n4) Canada and USA are two different countries. Graduate in Canada gives you work permit in Canada (not in USA). If you are extremely talented, US companies will hire you and apply for work permit for you. You do not simply walk accross the US border and start working for a company. It's lots of work for a mid size company to apply for a work permit for a Canadian but they will do it if your job is high demand - doctors, nurses, animal doctors/nurses, health care field and hospital support staff. <br />\n<br />\nThere is always hope you might really end up working in USA. One of my sisters fell in love with a Chinese-American. She has a degree in commerce in a small university in Canada. They met online by playing a game called &quot;world of warcraft&quot; and met in real life (apparently such love relationships is more common than you think) . They married and instead of the guy moving to Canada, my sister moved to USA. She was able to work in New York and then now works in California. The degree and work experience in Canada was no problem and was recognized in USA. <br />\n<br />\n5) once the Canadian rescue hong kong package is out, and it's indeed student loans + immigration. Then likely you are paying CANADIAN DOMESTIC TUITION. Canadian universities are subsidized by government, so domestic tuition is about 33% of international rates. So International student pay $300, domestic students only pay $100 in tuition.

BCIT for trades, Emily Carr University (for arts and design), Victoria University in Victoria city ( 1.5 hrs ferry from Vancouver), Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo (1.5hr ferry from Vancouver). There are also colleges such as Douglas College and Langara College. These are a few in Vancouver area. <br />\n<br />\n2) BC province is the one of the few that provide zero interest rate student loan. So if Canada's Hong Kong rescue plan for 18-35 is to provide student loans, and easy immigration, zero interest rates is quite attractive to come to BC and study here and eventually work. <br />\n<br />\n3) there is a silly argument that you can't get a job in a different location and is stuck in your university city. In a 比喻， It's like saying one grad from Chinese University at 火炭 and the other grad at Hong Kong university at 西環。So if you live in 火炭 area, you cannot apply for jobs on Hong Kong Island because your university is further away than Hong Kong university at 西環. <br />\n<br />\nIt's true Canada is a big county. If you are talented in successfully completing university and pretty ok social skills, you can apply and get jobs in any city inside Canada. Most employers see you grad is a known Canadian university (we don't have 野雞大學), and you did well in interview, you're hired with 3 months trial. <br />\n<br />\nThe only advantage of location is this. You normally try to apply for jobs in your home city before another province, so local employers have an advantage of hiring the fresh grads and new talent. <br />\n<br />\nUsually as a new grad, you will accept a good job even if it requires you to move. My first job after grad is in... Japan (for fun) and then a more serious government work in small town of 13000 people in the north. It took a few years to make it back to Vancouver area. <br />\n<br />\nOne of my sister grad as engineer at University of Waterloo and needed to move to Saskatoon to a work in a mine. <br />\n<br />\n4) Canada and USA are two different countries. Graduate in Canada gives you work permit in Canada (not in USA). If you are extremely talented, US companies will hire you and apply for work permit for you. You do not simply walk accross the US border and start working for a company. It's lots of work for a mid size company to apply for a work permit for a Canadian but they will do it if your job is high demand - doctors, nurses, animal doctors/nurses, health care field and hospital support staff. <br />\n<br />\nThere is always hope you might really end up working in USA. One of my sisters fell in love with a Chinese-American. She has a degree in commerce in a small university in Canada. They met online by playing a game called &quot;world of warcraft&quot; and met in real life (apparently such love relationships is more common than you think) . They married and instead of the guy moving to Canada, my sister moved to USA. She was able to work in New York and then now works in California. The degree and work experience in Canada was no problem and was recognized in USA. <br />\n<br />\n5) once the Canadian rescue hong kong package is out, and it's indeed student loans + immigration. Then likely you are paying CANADIAN DOMESTIC TUITION. Canadian universities are subsidized by government, so domestic tuition is about 33% of international rates. So International student pay $300, domestic students only pay $100 in tuition. So under this scheme and the quality of education, unless you are going to Harvard or Yale or those Ivy Leagues, it crazy to abandon the Canadian university for USA ones and pay International tuition rates."},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-10T01:40:54.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\"

BCIT for trades, Emily Carr University (for arts and design), Victoria University in Victoria city ( 1.5 hrs ferry from Vancouver), Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo (1.5hr ferry from Vancouver). There are also colleges such as Douglas College and Langara College. These are a few in Vancouver area. <br />\n<br />\n2) BC province is the one of the few that provide zero interest rate student loan. So if Canada's Hong Kong rescue plan for 18-35 is to provide student loans, and easy immigration, zero interest rates is quite attractive to come to BC and study here and eventually work. <br />\n<br />\n3) there is a silly argument that you can't get a job in a different location and is stuck in your university city. In a 比喻， It's like saying one grad from Chinese University at 火炭 and the other grad at Hong Kong university at 西環。So if you live in 火炭 area, you cannot apply for jobs on Hong Kong Island because your university is further away than Hong Kong university at 西環. <br />\n<br />\nIt's true Canada is a big county. If you are talented in successfully completing university and pretty ok social skills, you can apply and get jobs in any city inside Canada. Most employers see you grad is a known Canadian university (we don't have 野雞大學), and you did well in interview, you're hired with 3 months trial. <br />\n<br />\nThe only advantage of location is this. You normally try to apply for jobs in your home city before another province, so local employers have an advantage of hiring the fresh grads and new talent. <br />\n<br />\nUsually as a new grad, you will accept a good job even if it requires you to move. My first job after grad is in... Japan (for fun) and then a more serious government work in small town of 13000 people in the north. It took a few years to make it back to Vancouver area. <br />\n<br />\nOne of my sister grad as engineer at University of Waterloo and needed to move to Saskatoon to a work in a mine. <br />\n<br />\n4) Canada and USA are two different countries. Graduate in Canada gives you work permit in Canada (not in USA). If you are extremely talented, US companies will hire you and apply for work permit for you. You do not simply walk accross the US border and start working for a company. It's lots of work for a mid size company to apply for a work permit for a Canadian but they will do it if your job is high demand - doctors, nurses, animal doctors/nurses, health care field and hospital support staff. <br />\n<br />\nThere is always hope you might really end up working in USA. One of my sisters fell in love with a Chinese-American. She has a degree in commerce in a small university in Canada. They met online by playing a game called &quot;world of warcraft&quot; and met in real life (apparently such love relationships is more common than you think) . They married and instead of the guy moving to Canada, my sister moved to USA. She was able to work in New York and then now works in California.

BCIT for trades, Emily Carr University (for arts and design), Victoria University in Victoria city ( 1.5 hrs ferry from Vancouver), Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo (1.5hr ferry from Vancouver). There are also colleges such as Douglas College and Langara College. These are a few in Vancouver area. <br />\n<br />\n2) BC province is the one of the few that provide zero interest rate student loan. So if Canada's Hong Kong rescue plan for 18-35 is to provide student loans, and easy immigration, zero interest rates is quite attractive to come to BC and study here and eventually work. <br />\n<br />\n3) there is a silly argument that you can't get a job in a different location and is stuck in your university city. In a 比喻， It's like saying one grad from Chinese University at 火炭 and the other grad at Hong Kong university at 西環。So if you live in 火炭 area, you cannot apply for jobs on Hong Kong Island because your university is further away than Hong Kong university at 西環. <br />\n<br />\nIt's true Canada is a big county. If you are talented in successfully completing university and pretty ok social skills, you can apply and get jobs in any city inside Canada. Most employers see you grad is a known Canadian university (we don't have 野雞大學), and you did well in interview, you're hired with 3 months trial. <br />\n<br />\nThe only advantage of location is this. You normally try to apply for jobs in your home city before another province, so local employers have an advantage of hiring the fresh grads and new talent. <br />\n<br />\nUsually as a new grad, you will accept a good job even if it requires you to move. My first job after grad is in... Japan (for fun) and then a more serious government work in small town of 13000 people in the north. It took a few years to make it back to Vancouver area. <br />\n<br />\nOne of my sister grad as engineer at University of Waterloo and needed to move to Saskatoon to a work in a mine. <br />\n<br />\n4) Canada and USA are two different countries. Graduate in Canada gives you work permit in Canada (not in USA). If you are extremely talented, US companies will hire you and apply for work permit for you. You do not simply walk accross the US border and start working for a company. It's lots of work for a mid size company to apply for a work permit for a Canadian but they will do it if your job is high demand - doctors, nurses, animal doctors/nurses, health care field and hospital support staff. <br />\n<br />\nThere is always hope you might really end up working in USA. One of my sisters fell in love with a Chinese-American. She has a degree in commerce in a small university in Canada. They met online by playing a game called &quot;world of warcraft&quot; and met in real life (apparently such love relationships is more common than you think) . They married and instead of the guy moving to Canada, my sister moved to USA. She was able to work in New York and then now works in California. The degree and work experience in Canada was no problem and was recognized in USA. <br />\n<br />\n5) once the Canadian rescue hong kong package is out, and it's indeed student loans + immigration.

BCIT for trades, Emily Carr University (for arts and design), Victoria University in Victoria city ( 1.5 hrs ferry from Vancouver), Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo (1.5hr ferry from Vancouver). There are also colleges such as Douglas College and Langara College. These are a few in Vancouver area. <br />\n<br />\n2) BC province is the one of the few that provide zero interest rate student loan. So if Canada's Hong Kong rescue plan for 18-35 is to provide student loans, and easy immigration, zero interest rates is quite attractive to come to BC and study here and eventually work. <br />\n<br />\n3) there is a silly argument that you can't get a job in a different location and is stuck in your university city. In a 比喻， It's like saying one grad from Chinese University at 火炭 and the other grad at Hong Kong university at 西環。So if you live in 火炭 area, you cannot apply for jobs on Hong Kong Island because your university is further away than Hong Kong university at 西環. <br />\n<br />\nIt's true Canada is a big county. If you are talented in successfully completing university and pretty ok social skills, you can apply and get jobs in any city inside Canada. Most employers see you grad is a known Canadian university (we don't have 野雞大學), and you did well in interview, you're hired with 3 months trial. <br />\n<br />\nThe only advantage of location is this. You normally try to apply for jobs in your home city before another province, so local employers have an advantage of hiring the fresh grads and new talent. <br />\n<br />\nUsually as a new grad, you will accept a good job even if it requires you to move. My first job after grad is in... Japan (for fun) and then a more serious government work in small town of 13000 people in the north. It took a few years to make it back to Vancouver area. <br />\n<br />\nOne of my sister grad as engineer at University of Waterloo and needed to move to Saskatoon to a work in a mine. <br />\n<br />\n4) Canada and USA are two different countries. Graduate in Canada gives you work permit in Canada (not in USA). If you are extremely talented, US companies will hire you and apply for work permit for you. You do not simply walk accross the US border and start working for a company. It's lots of work for a mid size company to apply for a work permit for a Canadian but they will do it if your job is high demand - doctors, nurses, animal doctors/nurses, health care field and hospital support staff. <br />\n<br />\nThere is always hope you might really end up working in USA. One of my sisters fell in love with a Chinese-American. She has a degree in commerce in a small university in Canada. They met online by playing a game called &quot;world of warcraft&quot; and met in real life (apparently such love relationships is more common than you think) . They married and instead of the guy moving to Canada, my sister moved to USA. She was able to work in New York and then now works in California. The degree and work experience in Canada was no problem and was recognized in USA. <br />\n<br />\n5) once the Canadian rescue hong kong package is out, and it's indeed student loans + immigration. Then likely you are paying CANADIAN DOMESTIC TUITION. Canadian universities are subsidized by government, so domestic tuition is about 33% of international rates. So International student pay $300, domestic students only pay $100 in tuition. So under this scheme and the quality of education, unless you are going to Harvard or Yale or those Ivy Leagues, it crazy to abandon the Canadian university for USA ones and pay International tuition rates."},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-07-10T05:36:45.000Z","msg":"1.任何國家都有野雞大學<br />\n2. 個plan 未firm BC冇interest rate唔代表佢哋冇 <br />\nDon&rsquo;t give false hope you have no information on that <br />\n3.

Pipe fitters? Mecahnic? Car mechanic? Truck driver? Industrial machine repair? <br />\n<br />\nIf that is the case, we need you. If you enjoy working on your hands, BCIT is all about working with hands - trades type job.<br />\n<br />\nIt's best to learn a little on these trades in Hong Kong first. For example, let say you learned to be an electrician 電工 in Hong Kong and have worked 2 years. Then you move to my province of BC. Here's the plan in your head<br />\n<br />\n1) get BC student loans and go to BCIT. Get your English level up. Because you have experience, becoming a certified electrician through BCIT program should not be too difficult. Work part time for a master electrian. Also go for driving school (lots of Cantonese driving instructors) and get a driver license. This will be a busy 2-3 years. You can only rent near campus and you probably can only use public transport. <br />\n<br />\n2) you grad from BCIT and become Canadian certified electrician. You now need to choose where to work. Work is plentiful for electrician especially when there is lots of construction work in Vancouver due to very high housing prices. You should be earning $cad 25 and rising to $cad 40/ hour over next few years. The more you work, the more you get paid because work seems unlimited. If Vancouver had bad economy, you can travel to oil fields in Alberta to work as electrician and they pay 300% more. During these 5 years, you should be able to buy a car.<br />\n<br />\n3) while you are single, you do not give up your advantage of being mobile (ie taking any job in any area within driving distance). So buying an apartment (樓) is terrible idea. But you will have some savings in prepare for such a future.<br />\n<br />\n4) 8 years since you moved to BC, the student loans are half-way paid. Your English level is good enough to communicate. You fell in love. You got married. Now.. Two people with similar income levels, now you can start looking where to buy an apartment.<br />\n<br />\n5) currently Vancouver area in the outer area like Surrey (similar to 香港新界) is about $cad 400,000. But you can live in other cities and travel to Vancouver for the food. For example, you and live in Nanaimo, BC or Victoria, BC. The apartment can drop to 250,000-350,000 in those surrounding areas. and take water plane ($cad 100 per way) to fly 20-30 minutes to downtown Vancouver for lunch and all the Hong kong experience. Two people can afford this. <br />\n<br />\n6) 13-15 years in. You should be making easily $40 per hour and lots and lots  amount of work especially when you speak English and Cantonese and Mandarin (for the mainland China customers). Summer time will be extremely crazy and money keep flowing like never before. You have a child baby and want it to grow up and at least know a little Cantonese to order dim sum. So you move to Vancouver and buy a $cad 500,000 apartment. <br />\n<br />\nThe story continues and you probably will use the western way and hire a financial planner (advisor) to guide you to retirement."},{"pid":"6d68dcdea52525c51905d8f0955e11fb1c2fbfeb","tid":2098039,"uid":271635,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"e726fa130543705a62417a0d63a1f65a53f50786","tid":2098039,"uid":172599,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"61f62f4ccf15b98779fea0353275c9f37bf822dd","tid":2098039,"uid":60686,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"1443a2f889288f35d007a62c37a0c4602cb85678","tid":2098039,"uid":172599,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-07-11T17:01:36.000Z","msg":"咁加拿大真係好易"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-07-11T17:02:59.000Z","msg":"咁多香港人英文好+有master 咩<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n香港人既真正對手係印巴+東南亞國家既人"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-07-11T17:04:27.000Z","msg":"我 478 係咪算好穩陣等收"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-07-11T18:57:45.000Z","msg":"Score of 478 is very likely accepted.

/>\n【大紀元記者馮閱多倫多編譯報導】夏天是公寓出租的旺季。在長長的選擇列表上，哪個性價比更高？哪個更適合自己？您要考慮地理位置、室內佈局、附屬設施、交通狀況等等因素。因為這些方面不可能都能得到滿足，所以往往難以做出選擇。<br />\n單從附屬設施來看，房價不同設施也會有不同，衡量起來會比較容易一些。Condo通常價格較高，但包含的設施也會更多。不少Condo擁有洗衣機、健身房，電影院、宴會廳等，可能會讓你願意花更多的錢來享受這些便捷。總之，選擇之前一定要審視一下你是否會使用Condo所提供的諸多服務，這種生活方式是否更適合自己？<br />\n孰優孰劣<br />\nConrad Rygier是多倫多By The Park地產公司的銷售員，他說：「4月份到6月份是多市公寓出租的旺季。在這裡提醒租客在正式租房前要考慮多方面因素。」<br />\n「如果一個人的財政緊張，apartment將是個更好的選擇。如果收入良好，那麼就可以考慮離工作地點近的Condo，通常來說Condo都建在市中心，這樣您可以走路或騎車去上班。」<br />\nCondo裡的洗衣房也讓您免去搬運衣物到投幣洗衣房的麻煩。而Condo裡的健身房也比每月花費高達$60的私人俱樂部更安靜、更方便。很多Condo裡還有電影院和宴會廳。您也大可不必和朋友花錢在外面看電影或聚會。<br />\nMoneySense雜誌比較了不同的價格後發現：卡爾加里的Condo均價只比apartment高$42；而多倫多則因為附屬的健身房、洗衣房和娛樂設施等將近高出$200；在蒙特利爾，Condo均價比apartment高$310；而溫哥華，根據居住地不同，價格高出$104至$183不等。 <br />\n為了能享受這些附加的服務設施，首先要確保你目前的收入是否能承受得起。加拿大住房與抵押機構（CHMC)建議人們的租房及其他房屋花銷不能超過稅前收入的30%。<br />\nRygier說：「我認為花銷應該具有一定的經濟基礎，應在自己的承受能力範圍之內消費。如果租房花銷過大會有很大的風險。一旦您失業了又沒有足夠的積蓄該怎麼辦？」<br />\n2011年的CHMC報告指出，加拿大的住房數量不斷減少，房租也隨之升高。<br />\n加拿大統計局報告說2012年加拿大大城市的空房率是2.8%。其中卡爾加里最低，為1.3%。2010年4月至2011年4月，多倫多的空房率從2.7%下降到1.6%。與此同時，溫哥華從2.5%上漲到2.8%。蒙特利爾從2.8%下降到2.5%。<br />\n租房注意什麼<br />\nRygier提供了一些能減輕租房焦慮的方法：<br />\n1. 確定你搬遷的日子並提前通知房東<br />\n2. 確定新房的地址<br />\n3. 確定你的信用良好<br />\nRygier說：「大部分房東會要求你提供最近的信用記錄。在多倫多，TransUnion和Equifax是兩個最常見的信用記錄提供機構。您可以網上申請，一般價格在$15到$23。租房之前一定要確保你手頭有足夠的錢，因為您需要繳納第一個月和最後一個月的房租。」<br />\n看房時如有疑問，一定要多問。而且要認真計算自己每個月的花銷，尤其是有關公寓設施的費用。通常來說，一些私人公寓無需繳納水費，但需自付電費。而有些Condo所提供的服務設施也無限制條件。具體到自己租住的公寓一定要諮詢清楚，做到心中有數。<br />\n一旦你簽了合同之後，記住無論您的新家多麼好，也會有不可避免的損壞。更換或修補有可能是一筆很大的費用。此時，租客保險可為您節省很大一筆費用。◇"},{"pid":"334e6d8f8d14f350e484ec3dfdef3226658b4779","tid":2098039,"uid":32382,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-12T12:49:56.000Z","msg":"想問返加拿大藍領嚟講
