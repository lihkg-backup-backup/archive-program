Moreover, they insist on appealing the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation, putting political considerations above public safety. Medical staff are even forced to become a political tool to provide treatment for the huge amount of Chinese patient. We hereby express our vigorous denounce in response. <br />\n<br />\nThe University of Hong Kong has previously arranged the students who were suspected of being infected with Wuhan Pneumonia to the hospital in accordance with the guidelines of the Centre for Health Protection. The students in question visited Meng Wah Complex and Swire Hall. Such caused doubts among the students about the safety of the campus. Seeing as such, we would like to demand the school to:<br />\n<br />\n1. Suspend all classes until the Wuhan Pneumonia epidemic is under control<br />\n2. Implement mandatory health declaration from all students crossing the border from China<br />\n3. Decline all Chinese Tour groups from entering and visiting the campus<br />\n4. Disclose all epidemic control measures and their application and any infected or suspected case on campus <br />\n<br />\nDuring this time of crisis, the University shall shoulder the responsibility of protecting the students. We shall always stand by the students in this crucial time. <br />\n<br />\nOrganizer: Proposed Cabinet of Executive Committee, The Hong Kong University Students' Union, Session 2020"},{"pid":"4c3cf4c0bf6fd59715652a23d74edcbf77db982e","tid":1842389,"uid":302151,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-25T16:06:24.000Z","msg":"I DONT WANT TO DIE BECAUSE OF班垃圾支那人同我地個垃圾政府<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4ba64084a7837cf83e54db8f855091a01f625a3c","tid":1842389,"uid":26506,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-01-25T16:08:12.000Z","msg":"停咗喇，下次等佢去到半夜先啦"},{"pid":"5e7641b4abef50746eb3edca1a59afe8f05107b8","tid":1842389,"uid":144148,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-01-25T16:09:31.000Z","msg":"而家咪停俾你 又唔check email <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"db85638d1ba27f3ddcb35a1c3aeabef8ae9e09d5","tid":1842389,"uid":302151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"5e7641b4abef50746eb3edca1a59afe8f05107b8","tid":1842389,"uid":144148,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-01-25T16:09:31.000Z","msg":"而家咪停俾你 又唔check email <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-25T16:17:03.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />屌 佢自己飛左去垃圾郵件"},{"pid":"930ede3759aef0d2b7be93f1ef65b74cecb62fe5","tid":1842389,"uid":302151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"4ba64084a7837cf83e54db8f855091a01f625a3c","tid":1842389,"uid":26506,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-01-25T16:08:12.000Z","msg":"停咗喇，下次等佢去到半夜先啦"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-25T16:19:09.000Z","msg":"好彩出左post先<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 差啲send哂去之前開過既project group"}]}
