A 27 year old young man was beaten in the head repeatedly by police officers using batons on 7 October and was later sent to hospital, after much delay, 6 hours after the incident occurred. Computed tomography (CT) images that were leaked onto the Internet subsequently showed a left sided epidural haematoma (a particularly lethal kind of haemorrhage in the brain) compressing onto the brain. The young man was subsequently intubated and required emergency surgery for evacuation of the haematoma. As of the time of writing, the patient remained in intensive care and in critical condition.<br />\n<br />\nHad there been any further delay in treatment, the young man could have remained comatose forever, or even died. An epidural haematoma is one of the most lethal forms of intracranial bleeding - the actress Natasha Richardson passed away in 2009 after a mild head injury during a skiing trip and succumbed only hours later due to an epidural haematoma. This underscores just how severe the incident was.<br />\n<br />\nAll of this could have been avoided if the police had at least had the decency to avoid unnecessary head trauma during arrests and confrontations. To make things worse, they repeatedly delayed the patient from receiving adequate medical attention. Politics aside, it should be very clear that such acts should be strongly condemned in any civilized society - especially if they are carried out by uniformed officers.<br />\n<br />\nPlease push this incident onto international news and Twitter!"},{"pid":"c48eb2490010603c601c18fc30ba8465f2ca64ff","tid":1641166,"uid":261355,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-09T09:08:27.000Z","msg":"The news is absolutely true and the kid is still in ICU in Tuen Mun Hospital at the moment<br />\nMany of the medical staff are very disgruntled with regards to the case as all we know how lethal the condition could be."},{"pid":"d2e2ecae76e465ec3a66c3ba4172327cbb1e0d61","tid":1641166,"uid":269515,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-09T09:09:22.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/dance.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><strong><span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><span style=\"color: green;\">「Xinnie the Pooh」Challenge</span></span></strong><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/dance2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/q3PNSB7.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2Fq3PNSB7.png&h=70fa4b5f&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/a4UBLW8.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2Fa4UBLW8.png&h=10505b4b&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n1.
