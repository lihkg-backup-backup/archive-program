Grassley）於周五（2日）去信司法部及聯邦調查局（FBI），指經參議院調查後，發現其中一名指控卡瓦諾性侵的女子提供虛假陳述，要求兩部門介入調查。 <br />\n<br />\n格拉斯利指涉事女子芒羅&ndash;萊頓（Judy Munro-Leighton）化名來自加州的「多伊」（Jane Doe），並去信民主黨參議員哈里斯，聲稱自己是一名教師，已有家庭，指事發於青少年時期，當日她參加完派對後，由卡瓦諾及其一名朋友送她回家。2人在車廂後座輪姦她，事後還對她說，若她公開此事，沒有人會相信她，又叫她要做好女孩。 <br />\n<br />\n芒羅&ndash;萊頓於數日後以真名發電郵給參議院，參議院調查人員追蹤到其身份，發現她住在肯塔基州，根本不是加州，而且是民主黨人。參議院調查人員其後致電芒羅&ndash;萊頓查證，她承認在新聞見到自己的信件才決定寄電郵，指化名多伊寫信是想博取注意，又指「我憤怒所以寄電郵」。格拉斯利指摘芒羅&ndash;萊頓是左翼分子。<br />\n<br />\n<a
