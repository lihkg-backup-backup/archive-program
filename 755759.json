Unlike those networks, Europe's independent system is made for and operated by civilians. Its lower-precision navigation services are free for anyone to use, and private companies can purchase higher-precision capabilities. <br />\n<br />\nToday's mission was the third and final time that an Ariane 5 rocket has been used to launch Galileo satellites. With the next launch, in 2020, the new Ariane 6 rocket will take over and will start launching pairs of Galileo satellites. The Ariane 6 rocket will replace the Ariane 5, and the Ariane 5 ES configuration of the rocket that flew today has officially been retired."},{"pid":"99f79c5784b49ce1577893929d80407b23056097","tid":755759,"uid":54681,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T12:43:08.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
