Such amendment proposal triggered a series of ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong, as well as other cities around the world, with more than a million people getting to the streets to voice out their concerns.<br />\n<br />\nOn 12 June 2019, the day the Government tabled the second reading of the bill amendment, the demonstrations outside the Central Government Complex in Hong Kong descended into violent clashes between the protesters and police. Charging of metal gates, throwing of bricks, metal rods and rubbish were met with tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, resulting in tears and blood. Although the Government did call a halt in the bill amendment in the end, both protesters and police officers were deeply injured, physically and psychologically. This has been a very difficult moment in Hong Kong history.<br />\n<br />\nAs one of Hong Kong Police&rsquo;s in-house clinical psychologists, I witnessed the very difficult position the police was in. As a symbol of government power, police officers became scapegoats and suffered harsh blame, criticism and insults from the angry public. Many police officers repeatedly face cyber-bullying, personal insults and even death threats in the days following the incident, and foreseeably, in days to come as well.<br />\n<br />\nIn this session, I will share my hands-on experience and reflections in using the expressive arts to facilitate post-traumatic growth in Hong Kong police officers. There will also be visual presentations of their artwork and case sharing to illustrate the healing processes. <span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong>Participants with different political views are welcomed!</strong></span><br />\n<br />\nDrone Track<br />\n<br />\nFriday, March 27, 2020<br />\n<br />\n11AM &ndash; 12:30PM"},{"pid":"ab85906cb13dba342c9a5c730f1b459cfb1e7d22","tid":1808939,"uid":154054,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-02T17:09:07.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />痴撚缐"},{"pid":"4011b661182462099292885c64aeaafc6c52632a","tid":1808939,"uid":155818,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-01-02T17:10:17.000Z","msg":"藝術治療師？"},{"pid":"5e0a90402600772ccd28f95159520a5323ec17ef","tid":1808939,"uid":239765,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"4011b661182462099292885c64aeaafc6c52632a","tid":1808939,"uid":155818,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-01-02T17:10:17.000Z","msg":"藝術治療師？"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-02T17:12:09.000Z","msg":"佢應該係clinical psychologist<br />\n但呢個submission係講expressive arts"},{"pid":"87e21e93c318994e644bb9ea4fe8cdb2a586bd21","tid":1808939,"uid":205339,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-02T17:16:10.000Z","msg":"哦⋯⋯<br />\n咪姐係做雞又要拎貞節牌坊姐<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2xm/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2xm/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
