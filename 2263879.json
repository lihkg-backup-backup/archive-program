NBC, in its report, wrongly implicated our newspaper. Apple Daily Hong Kong adamantly rejects such implications and states that:<br />\n<br />\n1. Apple Daily Hong Kong has never commissioned Christopher Balding or any other person to write the 64-page document mentioned in the NBC report. Apple Daily Hong Kong has nothing to do with the document.<br />\n<br />\n2. Apple Daily Hong Kong has not received any inquiry from NBC prior to the publication of the NBC report, nor have we made any formal response concerning the NBC report before the release of this statement.<br />\n<br />\n3. Apple Daily Hong Kong urges NBC to clarify the confusion created by its report as soon as possible."},{"pid":"cbc071126f67d96029a8034ac1378c768f0cc0fe","tid":2263879,"uid":183758,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-30T08:16:32.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6a26d40a60996d6c533d24a522368e91cc729b82","tid":2263879,"uid":121146,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-30T08:48:50.000Z","msg":"咩英文黎 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\nA Statement from Apple Daily Hong Kong<br />\n<br />\nWe refer to the post on The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) website today claims that the 64-page intelligence document which exposes the business relationship between China and the United States presidential candidate Joe Biden&rsquo;s son, Hunter Biden, are made by fake resources......... 之後唔改喇  唔知UP緊乜"},{"pid":"72dd30944cb27a1af03b6c971330d13e8de788eb","tid":2263879,"uid":183758,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"6a26d40a60996d6c533d24a522368e91cc729b82","tid":2263879,"uid":121146,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-30T08:48:50.000Z","msg":"咩英文黎 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\nA Statement from Apple Daily Hong Kong<br />\n<br />\nWe refer to the post on The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) website today claims that the 64-page intelligence document which exposes the business relationship between China and the United States presidential candidate Joe Biden&rsquo;s son, Hunter Biden, are made by fake resources......... 之後唔改喇  唔知UP緊乜"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-30T09:26:41.000Z","msg":"我都覺得好怪<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a80cb69d15774f802ffd544315eed6771853f514","tid":2263879,"uid":236414,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-30T09:31:43.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"55c9f0cb79acb491171ff37916e93aada2c8ebf2","tid":2263879,"uid":183758,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a80cb69d15774f802ffd544315eed6771853f514","tid":2263879,"uid":236414,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"72dd30944cb27a1af03b6c971330d13e8de788eb","tid":2263879,"uid":183758,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"6a26d40a60996d6c533d24a522368e91cc729b82","tid":2263879,"uid":121146,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-30T08:48:50.000Z","msg":"咩英文黎 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\nA Statement from Apple Daily Hong Kong<br />\n<br />\nWe refer to the post on The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) website today claims that the 64-page intelligence document which exposes the business relationship between China and the United States presidential candidate Joe Biden&rsquo;s son, Hunter Biden, are made by fake resources......... 之後唔改喇  唔知UP緊乜"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-30T09:26:41.000Z","msg":"我都覺得好怪<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-30T09:31:43.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-30T09:32:18.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
