It is the claim that the unfair treatment of previous generations or perhaps a disadvantaged childhood entitles one to special consideration today as an adult or young adult. Most Americans, who are both generous and pragmatic, have been willing to extend some of these benefits, at the margins and for limited periods. They don&rsquo;t want to turn these concessions into large, permanent entitlement programs, giving substantially different treatment to different groups, even if those groups have suffered historical wrongs.<br />\n<br />\nOne measure of how unpopular these unequal programs are is how often their proponents need to rename them. &ldquo;Quotas&rdquo; were restyled as &ldquo;affirmative action.&rdquo; The goal was still to give special benefits to some groups to achieve desired outcomes. Now &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; has also become toxic, rejected most recently by voters in deep-blue California. Hence, the new name, &ldquo;equity.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nInstead of making their case openly and honestly, advocates of equity twist and turn to avoid revealing their radical goal of re-engineering society through coercion. If the results fall short, as they inevitably would, the remedy is obvious: more money, more rules and more indoctrination. Why not tell us who will receive these special benefits and for how long? At whose expense? Who will administer these programs? Who will judge whether the outcomes are fair enough? When will it all end?<br />\n<br />\nSince the ultimate goal is achieving equal outcomes, these evasions raise the hardest question of all.<span class=\"red\"> Isn&rsquo;t equity just a new brand name for the oldest program of achieving equal outcomes?
