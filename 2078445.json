Kevin Cramer is holding up bipartisan legislation as administration pushes for changes.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">On June 2, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) signed on as a co-sponsor of a bill to punish China for undermining Hong Kong&rsquo;s independence. Two weeks later, he turned around and blocked it &mdash; at the request of the White House.</span><br />\n<br />\nAs a result, the bipartisan bill, which imposes mandatory sanctions over China&rsquo;s continued incursions into Hong Kong&rsquo;s internal affairs, is stalled on Capitol Hill even as it has broad bipartisan support.<br />\n<br />\nThe episode, which had not been previously reported, underscores the uphill battle for Congress&rsquo; China hawks as they push the Trump administration to punish Beijing over an array of issues, from Hong Kong to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Even for us, this is dysfunctional,&rdquo; Cramer acknowledged on Wednesday, a week after he objected to the bill&rsquo;s unanimous passage on the Senate floor, after a last-minute plea from the Trump administration.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Cramer, the White House and State Department proposed a series of &ldquo;technical&rdquo; corrections to the bill only a half-hour before Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was set to ask for unanimous consent to pass his bill, the Hong Kong Autonomy Act. Cramer defended his decision to block the legislation, saying he hopes the bill eventually passes but that he wanted to try to &ldquo;accommodate&rdquo; the Trump administration&rsquo;s concerns.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t seen it yet. So my concern was, I don&rsquo;t think we should do a [unanimous consent request] until we have at least considered the technical review,&rdquo; Cramer said in a brief interview. &ldquo;I still haven&rsquo;t seen it. So I don&rsquo;t know how dramatic the changes were that they were advocating or whether they hate the whole idea.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nCramer added that the White House &ldquo;asked me if I would consider&rdquo; blocking the bill in the meantime, even though Cramer co-sponsored the bill.<br />\n<br />\nVan Hollen said the proposed changes were &ldquo;significant,&rdquo; but he predicted &ldquo;we may be able to work with&rdquo; some of them.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident we would have an overwhelming bipartisan positive vote on this if it came up. So we&rsquo;re going to keep pushing on it,&rdquo; Van Hollen said in an interview.<br />\n<br />\nThe Trump administration already has the statutory authority to impose a limited set of sanctions in response to China&rsquo;s recent national security law, which significantly encroaches on Hong Kong&rsquo;s autonomy. In late May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that Hong Kong, a former British colony, was no longer autonomous from China &mdash; a move that comes with significant trade implications.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;While the United States once hoped that a free and prosperous Hong Kong would provide a model for authoritarian China, it is now clear that China is modeling Hong Kong after itself,&rdquo; Pompeo said at the time.<br />\n<br />\nVan Hollen&rsquo;s bill, which he introduced earlier this year alongside Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), would impose mandatory sanctions on individuals, banks and other entities that enable China&rsquo;s violations of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which established Hong Kong&rsquo;s sovereignty.<br />\n<br />\nPresident Donald Trump has come under fire for his posture toward China, including recent scrutiny over allegations made by former national security adviser, John Bolton, who claims in his new book that the president sought political favors from Chinese President Xi Jinping. Bolton writes that Trump even encouraged Xi to continue building detention camps for religious minorities, most notably the Uighur Muslims, in the country&rsquo;s Xinjiang region."},{"pid":"8aca1fbbf6663d1e8a8bfced6baefeebf426b853","tid":2078445,"uid":310700,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-25T05:11:42.000Z","msg":"Source: Political <br
