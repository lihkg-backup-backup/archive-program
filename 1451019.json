Disgracefully, the Hong Kong government and the police dispersed the protesters by brutal forces and even turned a blind eye to the attacks by the triad gangsters against the protesters on 21-7-2019.

Some of the tear gas were even purposelessly ignited - when the police retreated and entered the police station, a few rounds of tear gas were fired towards the crowd, probably as a mean of retaliation (Photo 2,3,4,5 and 6).<br />\n(Link: The night quiet Hong Kong working-class neighbourhood Wong Tai Sin became a smoking battleground <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021387/night-quiet-working-class-neighbourhood-hong-kong-became\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Fnews%2Fhong-kong%2Fpolitics%2Farticle%2F3021387%2Fnight-quiet-working-class-neighbourhood-hong-kong-became&d=926QiOG7cNu1sWdYPFF%2FaKEelou7VeK%2FuoOlBiwx%2FXk%3D&h=71366ea0\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021387/night-quiet-working-class-neighbourhood-hong-kong-became</a>)<br />\n<br />\nPhoto 2:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/d26nwapnyyqy2vh/Photo%2011-8-2019%2C%2023%2017%2056.jpg?dl=0\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fd26nwapnyyqy2vh%2FPhoto%252011-8-2019%252C%252023%252017%252056.jpg%3Fdl%3D0&d=926QiOG7cNu1sWdYPFF%2FaKEelou7VeK%2FuoOlBiwx%2FXk%3D&h=562fe4e3\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/d26nwapnyyqy2vh/Photo%2011-8-2019%2C%2023%2017%2056.jpg?dl=0</a><br />\n<br />\nPhoto 3:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/lje1xv40tym4qce/Photo%2011-8-2019%2C%2023%2018%2057.jpg?dl=0\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Flje1xv40tym4qce%2FPhoto%252011-8-2019%252C%252023%252018%252057.jpg%3Fdl%3D0&d=926QiOG7cNu1sWdYPFF%2FaKEelou7VeK%2FuoOlBiwx%2FXk%3D&h=9882f4a0\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/lje1xv40tym4qce/Photo%2011-8-2019%2C%2023%2018%2057.jpg?dl=0</a><br />\n<br />\nPhoto 4:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/7roayhcl5e284dg/Photo%2011-8-2019%2C%2023%2019%2016.jpg?dl=0\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2F7roayhcl5e284dg%2FPhoto%252011-8-2019%252C%252023%252019%252016.jpg%3Fdl%3D0&d=926QiOG7cNu1sWdYPFF%2FaKEelou7VeK%2FuoOlBiwx%2FXk%3D&h=6c07274e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/7roayhcl5e284dg/Photo%2011-8-2019%2C%2023%2019%2016.jpg?dl=0</a><br />\n<br />\nPhoto 5:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/p7l825v8ml2qazd/Photo%2011-8-2019%2C%2023%2020%2021.jpg?dl=0\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fp7l825v8ml2qazd%2FPhoto%252011-8-2019%252C%252023%252020%252021.jpg%3Fdl%3D0&d=926QiOG7cNu1sWdYPFF%2FaKEelou7VeK%2FuoOlBiwx%2FXk%3D&h=f19d545a\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/p7l825v8ml2qazd/Photo%2011-8-2019%2C%2023%2020%2021.jpg?dl=0</a><br />\n<br />\nPhoto 6:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/7c25mk1m2cqc6ls/Photo%2011-8-2019%2C%2023%2021%2050.jpg?dl=0\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2F7c25mk1m2cqc6ls%2FPhoto%252011-8-2019%252C%252023%252021%252050.jpg%3Fdl%3D0&d=926QiOG7cNu1sWdYPFF%2FaKEelou7VeK%2FuoOlBiwx%2FXk%3D&h=9c243e10\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/7c25mk1m2cqc6ls/Photo%2011-8-2019%2C%2023%2021%2050.jpg?dl=0</a>"},{"pid":"beda44cec6e9e4713b755e2f2fcb7ebed8fe4367","tid":1451019,"uid":41093,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-11T23:38:48.000Z","msg":"too late"},{"pid":"f940400e21a7361a5f803041bc4ac46b817eb1ec","tid":1451019,"uid":296179,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-11T23:39:03.000Z","msg":"3.
