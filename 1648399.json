Escalation is what the HK govt wants, to weaken overall support for the movement. Also, foreign leaders don&rsquo;t like vandalism since they don&rsquo;t want their own citizens to think that it is acceptable (no matter the reason); we shouldn&rsquo;t lose their support. The situation now also makes it really easy for dirty police to vandalise and frame protests for it.<br />\nInstead of going into this trap, we should increase pressure on the HK govt. Let&rsquo;s give any de-escalation as a an &lsquo;olive branch&rsquo; (with the 5 demands) and let the World know, so the govt will be in the hot spot. If they just repeat the same usual shit it&rsquo;ll look really bad for them, but we will remind others that we are organised and peaceful if we had the choice.<br />\nLet&rsquo;s also take time to think things over and decide what to do next. At this point, it&rsquo;s more important than ever to unite. We all have a stake here and we are stronger together.<br />\nLastly, we should take the this time to remember those who are missing or already left us. This needs much more attention but it&rsquo;s being overshadowed by the news of conflicts. The World needs to know, it&rsquo;s the only way to bring any justice (as police won&rsquo;t investigate).<br />\nYou guys are very bright, but don&rsquo;t let anger take over."},{"pid":"d77c9a4995acf5db491d5c3689aeffd330ded757","tid":1648399,"uid":236281,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-12T08:06:03.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/XYXcJBO.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FXYXcJBO.jpg&h=b5f3ec88&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"d5b125a4c397f3d51669e7b8fe6832c4983e7357","tid":1648399,"uid":322230,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-12T08:34:17.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><span style=\"color: gold;\"> <ins> <div style=\"text-align: center;\"> 公民抗爭式交稅<br />\n<br />\n香港人真 &middot; 反抗！！！<br />\n<br />\n入黎跟住做啦！！！<br />\n<br />\n＞【<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1637669】＜\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1637669】＜</a></div></ins></span></span>"},{"pid":"cc352fe4b4791d481cebe88ebc01b2b893dd3e0b","tid":1648399,"uid":24298,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-12T09:18:13.000Z","msg":"推<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"642f2a5faf1cf8c340151626e65c5412c7fa2e34","tid":1648399,"uid":309045,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-12T09:22:15.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f69ecf768b633eb3ec1351b8c75d5d22150bc821","tid":1648399,"uid":261627,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-12T09:25:15.000Z","msg":"出 world台啦"}]}
