Three weeks later, more hair was missing and this time there were sores. She's quite skittish, so we can't touch her, apply Frontline or cage her for a trip to the vet. What can we do?<br />\n<br />\nA: The location of the hair loss, in conjunction with the season, makes a flea infestation the most likely possibility. Any dog or cat that doesn't receive flea preventative is likely to have some flea bites (even if you never see the fleas). Flea allergy dermatitis is a very common cause of itchiness and hair loss around the base of the tail, thighs and belly in both cats and dogs. The best treatment is year-round flea preventative, topical or oral. You could try hiding an oral flea preventative in a small amount of canned food. Capstar, for instance, is a very effective oral flea treatment that you could give her every other day.<br />\n<br />\nAnother possibility is that the hair loss and sores may have been caused by some form of trauma, such as a bite wound. If the cat continues to lose hair or develops more sores, I recommend trying to bring her to your local veterinarian because she may need antibiotics.<br />\n<br />\nA third but less likely possibility is ringworm<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.thecatniptimes.com/learn/cat-care-tips/5-ailments-hair-loss-in-cats-can-be-a-symptom-of/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecatniptimes.com%2Flearn%2Fcat-care-tips%2F5-ailments-hair-loss-in-cats-can-be-a-symptom-of%2F&d=6zgGjWaceJ4ICz2LU8gYznG9l5Y5fMjkJfB04Oq%2Bkmk%3D&h=fbcd9558\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.thecatniptimes.com/learn/cat-care-tips/5-ailments-hair-loss-in-cats-can-be-a-symptom-of/</a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://wagwalking.com/cat/condition/hair-loss\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwagwalking.com%2Fcat%2Fcondition%2Fhair-loss&d=6zgGjWaceJ4ICz2LU8gYznG9l5Y5fMjkJfB04Oq%2Bkmk%3D&h=6a29793e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://wagwalking.com/cat/condition/hair-loss</a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://knutsfordvetsurgery.co.uk/why-does-my-cat-have-bald-patches/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fknutsfordvetsurgery.co.uk%2Fwhy-does-my-cat-have-bald-patches%2F&d=6zgGjWaceJ4ICz2LU8gYznG9l5Y5fMjkJfB04Oq%2Bkmk%3D&h=4b44bc1d\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://knutsfordvetsurgery.co.uk/why-does-my-cat-have-bald-patches/</a>"},{"pid":"53c46adc48ed1deb44e60c772b622415d7960d0f","tid":2236486,"uid":43594,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-09T17:38:29.000Z","msg":"帶佢哋睇醫生啦"},{"pid":"d957a19b853c707ccac206e9666b0770f9cb86dd","tid":2236486,"uid":23194,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-09T17:41:18.000Z","msg":"生癬"},{"pid":"09fccbae941a96ac749705db0ef382d084a82d3a","tid":2236486,"uid":377869,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-09T19:36:03.000Z","msg":"小心傳染人/其他動物，摸完佢用番梘洗手<br />\n唔好摸返自己塊面<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<span class=\"xx-large\">睇醫生啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/donno.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/donno.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></span>"},{"pid":"8183952ce72c95cbe66aee215705c2db35b91930","tid":2236486,"uid":261922,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-10T04:31:39.000Z","msg":"浪浪執咗最好睇一睇醫生先 可能有寄生蟲 你對佢身體狀況都有個底"}]}
