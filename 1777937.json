During the event, Jimmy Sham, a well-known gay political leader who fights for both LGBT and political rights, was called 'damn homo' by police.<br />\n<br />\n'Police suddenly set a line of defense. I worried that there would be a conflict between police and citizens. I went to urge protestors to get back to the crossroad. When I arrived at the front line, although I was asking protestors to leave, multiple police pointed at me and called me &quot;damn homo&quot;. Was it a so-called professional action? They presumably recognised me, else they would not scold me in this way. Today, you can see that the police force continuously provoked the protestors and the protest event applicant. They did it using insulting and threatening wordings with a negative manner. This is extremely unsatisfactory,' Jimmy Sham said.<br />\n<br />\nLau Ting-sing, a famous gay businessman who owned thousands of 'inappropriate' photos of male celebrities and policemen, commented on this incident. 'You guys (heterosexual policeman) are so straight, yet you are still greedy for money that you would take nude photographs!' He mocked.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to HK Apple Daily, a Hong Kong newspaper, some police called the passerby 'cockroach'. It is a Nazi word related to massacre. They also asked reporters to 'shut up' and pointed strong flashing light at them. Moreover, they pointed guns and batons at an old woman."}]}
