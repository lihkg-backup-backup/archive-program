Why did you wait so long to come to this decision, and are you nervous about the march planned for tomorrow? Thank you.<br />\n <br />\nChief Executive:<br />\n<br />\nOur decision has nothing to do with what may happen tomorrow. As I answered in another question, it has nothing to do with an intention, a wish, to pacify. Why take so long? Actually, if you remember what I said in my account, I acknowledge that last Sunday we had a large number of people coming out. It's very peaceful, generally orderly. This is part of Hong Kong &ndash; we do have that sort of protest from time to time. <span style=\"color: red;\">But it is on Wednesday that the polarization of views in society relating to this bill has given rise to violence, very serious confrontations, people being hurt, police on the ground being forced to take some of those measures. That's why I came to the view, I told myself that I need to do something decisively to address two issues: how could I restore as fast as possible the calm in society and how could I avoid any more law enforcement officers and ordinary citizens being injured.</span> That was Wednesday to Saturday. Meanwhile, I met with people, because, as you know, in these sort of circumstances you have only one shot.  I need to ask my advisors, I need to think through, our team has to deliberate it within ourselves, and this is my earliest opportunity. Although it is a Saturday, I did not wait until Monday to explain to you the deliberations leading to this decision. I hope you understand.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">林鄭：<span style=\"color: red;\">唔係打到仆街，我都費事理你班傻仔呀</span><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/z.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></span>"},{"pid":"0d835abafada215046932b5aa52ed190e846afc4","tid":1233769,"uid":55803,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-16T21:38:18.000Z","msg":"原文From 01 <a href=\"https://www.hk01.com/%E7%A4%BE%E6%9C%83%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E/340902/%E9%80%83%E7%8A%AF%E6%A2%9D%E4%BE%8B-%E6%9E%97%E9%84%AD%E6%9C%88%E5%A8%A5%E8%A8%98%E8%80%85%E6%9C%83-%E4%BA%A4%E4%BB%A3%E6%9A%AB%E7%B7%A9%E4%BF%AE%E4%BE%8B-%E5%B0%8D%E7%AD%94%E5%85%A8%E6%96%87%E7%B4%80%E9%8C%84\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hk01.com%2F%25E7%25A4%25BE%25E6%259C%2583%25E6%2596%25B0%25E8%2581%259E%2F340902%2F%25E9%2580%2583%25E7%258A%25AF%25E6%25A2%259D%25E4%25BE%258B-%25E6%259E%2597%25E9%2584%25AD%25E6%259C%2588%25E5%25A8%25A5%25E8%25A8%2598%25E8%2580%2585%25E6%259C%2583-%25E4%25BA%25A4%25E4%25BB%25A3%25E6%259A%25AB%25E7%25B7%25A9%25E4%25BF%25AE%25E4%25BE%258B-%25E5%25B0%258D%25E7%25AD%2594%25E5%2585%25A8%25E6%2596%2587%25E7%25B4%2580%25E9%258C%2584&d=sdtaPhne9yHE0zuhYC4X4XocbXMCqCW%2BK0Nx6tfHLyc%3D&h=5ceef714\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.hk01.com/%E7%A4%BE%E6%9C%83%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E/340902/%E9%80%83%E7%8A%AF%E6%A2%9D%E4%BE%8B-%E6%9E%97%E9%84%AD%E6%9C%88%E5%A8%A5%E8%A8%98%E8%80%85%E6%9C%83-%E4%BA%A4%E4%BB%A3%E6%9A%AB%E7%B7%A9%E4%BF%AE%E4%BE%8B-%E5%B0%8D%E7%AD%94%E5%85%A8%E6%96%87%E7%B4%80%E9%8C%84</a>"}]}
