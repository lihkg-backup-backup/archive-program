Nevertheless, we still keep on fighting, in the hopes that our efforts will not be forgotten by the rest of the world.<br />\n<br />\nBacked by the Chinese Communist Party, the Hong Kong Police Force have been brazen about their violence and brutality against citizens, which has become a serious threat to our lives and properties. The government have turned a deaf ear to international condemnations and have refused to change nor to respond to our demands, instead they are protracting in the attempts of disintegrating the protests movement. Beijing have failed to fulfill their promises made under the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984, they continue to ruin &ldquo;One Country, Two Systems&rdquo; and damage the judicial system, and have hastened their speed in social and political infiltration in order to impede universal suffrage by 2047. In face of all the difficulties, we are, notwithstanding, at the front line against the Communists, and we resolutely defend our values and rights for freedom and democracy.<br />\n<br />\nThe election of Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo) will be held in September 2020. Just as what has been happening in recent years, half of the LegCo seats will continued to be sent by the Pro-Beijing camp, hence the LegCo will still be under Beijing control regardless of the number of votes and the number of seats that the Pro-Democracy camp wins, in which case the LegCo will continue to lose its function in keeping government legislation in check. And just as what has been happening, hundreds of billions dollars will continue to be sent from Hong Kong to China by passing the bills that are detrimental to Hong Kong, which will further undermine Hong Kong&rsquo;s special status that was once highly favourable for international businesses and trades. In view of this, we appeal to your government&rsquo;s support to urge the Hong Kong Government and Beijing to respond to Hong Kong people&rsquo;s demand to elect 2020 LegCo by universal suffrage, and object to the upcoming LegCo election in September 2020 that is neither democratic and nor is elected by universal suffrage. As we all know, it is only through election by universal suffrage that the LegCo can legitimately and effectively represent people&rsquo;s demands and interests, thereupon returning power to the people, so that our desire for transitional justice can be achieved.<br />\n<br />\nV&aacute;clav Havel, former President of Czech Republic, said &quot;I really do inhabit a system in which words are capable of shaking the entire structure of government, where words can prove mightier than ten military divisions.&quot; I encourage you to believe that the power of words is suffice to change the world, and I hereby invite you to change the world for the better by vocally pressing Beijing and the Hong Kong Government to fulfill their promise on our rights for universal suffrage.<br />\n<br
