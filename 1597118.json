On June 9th, more than a million people (15% of the entire population of the city) turned up on the streets, demanding you to withdraw the extradition bill. What did you do? you issued a statement at night, while some were still marching, that the government respects people&rsquo;s right to exercise their freedoms, nonetheless the bill would still go forward. <br />\n<br />\nIt was you that gave some protestors no choice but to surround the Legislative Council on the June 12th because there was no other way to preventing the passage of the bill that is an existential threat to Hong Kong&rsquo;s political, economic, financial system and Hong Kong&rsquo;s way of life. In return, the protestors were greeted with rounds of tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds. <br />\nYou then went on to label those protestors as rioters, partaking in riots without substantive proof at a press conference. <br />\nIn a couple of days, you reluctantly announced the suspension of the bill despite the demand was a complete withdrawal.<br />\n<br />\nThen 2 million people turned up to the streets the following week, more than a quarter of the entire population, fearing that they had not been clear enough. Suspension of the bill would not do, the other demands being the establishment of an independent commission of enquiry investing police conduct, withdrawing the characterisation of the protesters as rioters and armistice to those already arrested, universal suffrage and of course, your resignation which was already being demanded on the June 9th by many marching on the streets. <br />\nBut you did nothing. Nothing. You stayed in your tax payer funded villa for months when Hong Kong needed its leader most in a crisis of your own making, and went on to complain about not being able to go the barbers or to the shops when not just protestors, but ordinary citizens were being assaulted, beaten, tortured by the police. <br />\nYou didn&rsquo;t do anything other than issuing a feeble statement when ordinary citizens, including journalists, a pregnant woman were being assaulted in a train station and in train carriages by triads in white shirts in Yuen Long on 21st July.<br />\nIt took more than 3 months, more than 1500 arrested, 9 suicides in protest of the bill for you to announce the intention of withdrawing of the bill instead of actually doing it. <br />\nYou then proceed to distract Hong Kongers and suggesting the mess that you created was not really that bad by suggesting instead we should be focusing on other topics. <br />\nWhen Hong Kongers are rightly concerned about their fundamental freedoms being taken away from them, the freedom from fear taken away from them, the collapse of our political institutions, the torn up of Hong Konger&rsquo;s social contract the now non-existent accountability and legitimacy of their government. Instead you would suggest turning our attention towards unaffordable housing and the lack of social mobility. <br />\nYou like to talk about the rule of law and the basic law, when it suits you."},{"pid":"8b4efab909e37f61eac281730d5a90d74aceb9dc","tid":1597118,"uid":147724,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-26T23:06:28.000Z","msg":"You don&rsquo;t talk about the rule of law and the basic law when the department of Justice are suspiciously slow when charging white shirt triads committing acts of terror in Yuen Long but have no difficulties charging protestors of rioting and sending them to court the next day. <br />\n<br />\nYou are pretending as if you have nothing to do with the havoc that you created (havoc being your own description in a leaked audio tape to Reuters) <br />\n<br />\nNone of the above would have happened had you truly listened to the people&rsquo;s demands after the one million march in early June. <br />\n<br />\nYou have destroyed the one country two system framework, yet telling people that it still works. You have sided with the Chinese government on every single issue instead with Hong Kongers. <br />\n<br />\nEver since you took over as the leader of Hong Kong, never once have you stood with its people. You have only been busy taking orders from Beijing, not from the Hong Kongers. <br />\n<br />\nYou now have zero credibility, authority, legitimacy in the eyes of Hong Kongers with no one else to blame.  <br />\nYou have destroyed Hong Kongs&rsquo;s past and present, yet are now lecturing Hong Konger sanctimoniously about creating a better future. <br />\n<br />\nThe proposals you have in mind, the attempted distraction from the root cause of the summer of discontent cannot be treated other than as an insult on Hong Kongers. <br />\nYou have never listened to us because you never cared, and it would require more than a stretch of imagination to think things will change under your &lsquo;leadership&rsquo;."},{"pid":"41d1b75d141259f784f3b6055ca3c4005e1b7031","tid":1597118,"uid":147724,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-26T23:08:48.000Z","msg":"*周街都係臭雞"},{"pid":"6d32d92f47a3ba0c3cffae9d8d40988ae2f3cbb4","tid":1597118,"uid":147724,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-26T23:19:01.000Z","msg":"頂"},{"pid":"9bd4896acaa5b9612047548585685e0863170c07","tid":1597118,"uid":147724,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-26T23:20:10.000Z","msg":"可以先睇左林鄭篇op-ed
