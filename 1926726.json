This is true. Yet, there are a lot of contributing factors related to mental health issues. However, my study is not trying to find a CAUSAL  relationship. The core of a correlation analysis is only determining the relationship between the constructs that I proposed. Hence, there are many correlation analyses between many constructs (vulnerability, sibling interaction, etc) and mental health. But my study only focuses on mental health.<br />\n<br />\nThis is an explorative study. The key is, there might not be any correlations between internet use and mental health problems. My study does not guarantee a significant correlation between the two. There is a good chance that they have no correlations at all. If so, it is still a good result because this means that the severity of problematic internet use is not affecting our mental health, so people do not have to worry about 上網太多會影響心理健康. Of course, my hypothesis suggests the other way. Therefore, I am not proving my theory but to test if my hypothesis is true. I will accept either way.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, I can do a correlation study between 養貓 and mental health. The result could be no relationship at all. But we do not know if it is true until we do the study. So we need to conduct this study. Since there are limited studies on the level of internet use and mental health in HK, my study will be investigating if there are any relationships. If so, how strong.<br />\n<br />\n2. True, it is a problem. The SDQ and Media Activity Form are developed by multiple psychologists to specialise in measuring them with good reliability and validity. However, they are supposed to be filled in paper form. They are very short questionnaires on paper, but might be troublesome to do online. However, I must include all questions and retain their forms because any changes will affect the reliability.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, based on the population response, the average duration to fill in is ~15 mins, which is consistent with my estimated time stated on the first page. I hope people to reserve time yo fill in this. But I know that it&rsquo;s hard."},{"pid":"803fe26b15c87cf0b953794ce2e5fb0a0309b964","tid":1926726,"uid":263839,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a39b85f337ce6b670b27a397e25b73248f2faed7","tid":1926726,"uid":302618,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"163386e6b161428d4fc80fd6099e56cef4ded0fc","tid":1926726,"uid":263839,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"c0f59619b9c6d18eefc7d3dd5b1035ae4b43e6dd","tid":1926726,"uid":302618,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-15T20:46:03.000Z","msg":"樓主請自己同埋搵朋友用手機睇多一次份嘢先"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-16T04:46:44.000Z","msg":"係... 唔好意思請問有咩問題?"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-03-16T09:01:32.000Z","msg":"利申， 非臨床心理學家， 亦未全部問題睇曬， 以下純個人意見， 諗到乜講乜， 有錯有漏請勿屌<br />\n<br />\n1 your aim and assumption determine your methodology.
