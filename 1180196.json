Speaking about it, Mika said:<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It was written on a day of extreme heat in August. It was the last few weeks of writing for the album; a writing period that lasted two years. Through the writing I had confronted personal, serious and at times painful issues. By the end of it I felt lighter and freer. This was one of the last songs written for the new album. The song is a daydream fantasy. Like a heat mirage, and makes me feel like anything is possible. Summer and heat provokes that. The surreal dreamlike state of endless heat soaked afternoons. Pearls of sweat, dreams of summer flings, the smell and feel of a car in summer when you first step into it, the smell of a plastic parasol baking in the sun. The mix of possibility and lazy frustration. Senses and daydreams on the run.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nIce Cream is available everywhere from tomorrow - 31.05.19 🍦❤️"},{"pid":"2e0a88fc36a8a22ba03864b180f6b7cf12cd2e40","tid":1180196,"uid":6898,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-01T12:13:19.000Z","msg":"mika第一隻碟世界級正<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"2b97871cb5f48d594620b9615b4956a133ceecf0","tid":1180196,"uid":55982,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-01T16:26:35.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />得我一個聽？"},{"pid":"6cbd055dccdeaeb156c4f07d5f2a1f99ccae9d33","tid":1180196,"uid":172147,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-01T16:29:31.000Z","msg":"My interpretation<br />\nGood gone girl<br />\nGrace kelly<br />\nHappy ending<br />\n到而家都仲聽緊"},{"pid":"07a45774bb99926fbc8a185efe4a609260e5f36a","tid":1180196,"uid":29942,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-01T16:42:25.000Z","msg":"以前好鍾意聽Mika<br />\n依家都好鍾意<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
