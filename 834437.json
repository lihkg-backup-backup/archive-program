These sources, who weren't authorized to discuss the plans with the media, told me the effort is expected to launch in the next few weeks.<br />\n<br />\nWhat we're hearing: The broadside against China &mdash; which is planned to be both rhetorical and substantive &mdash; will be &quot;administration-wide,&quot; including the White House (led by senior officials on the National Security Council), Treasury, Commerce and Defense. &quot;We're not just going to let Russia be the bogeyman,&quot; one White House official told me. &quot;It's Russia and China.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nShow less<br />\nThe White House plans to unveil new information about China's hostile actions against America's public and private sectors, and to act on it.<br />\nAdministration officials will call out China for its &quot;malign activity&quot; in cyberattacks, election interference and industrial warfare (e.g., intellectual property theft), an administration source told me.<br />\nThe administration has marshaled tons of data to support its charges against China. &quot;We are going to show how the Chinese have infiltrated the U.S. and what we are doing to counter it,&quot; the source said.<br />\nBehind the scenes: &quot;The push is coming from the national security apparatus,&quot; the source added. &quot;Cyber theft has been appearing more often in the PDBs [President's Daily Brief].&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe unknowns: Neither administration official explained why the administration is pursuing this now. China has been an aggressor on trade and cyber issues for years, and the Trump administration has started a trade war with the country. At the same time, Trump has maintained cheery rhetoric toward President Xi Jinping in hopes of cooperating on some issues.<br />\n<br />\nThe extent to which Trump will lead this rhetorical push isn&rsquo;t clear. But he's green lit it, according to a source familiar with the planning.<br />\nThere's a good chance Trump will keep saying positive things about Xi to protect their relationship, delegating the hottest rhetoric to China hawks like Peter Navarro.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-administration-anti-china-campaign-2c17776d-ad80-4a79-b6a7-912927059833.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.axios.com%2Ftrump-administration-anti-china-campaign-2c17776d-ad80-4a79-b6a7-912927059833.html&d=bVbFEPqeSkte1NQq8Yo1ynadZns4eLIrfSaUqUvMaEw%3D&h=bcfc403a\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.axios.com/trump-administration-anti-china-campaign-2c17776d-ad80-4a79-b6a7-912927059833.html</a>"},{"pid":"deddf8450ab09439e9d48146cbc392777381e146","tid":834437,"uid":32722,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T07:57:36.000Z","msg":"最好係凍結中國官員在美國的所有資產<br />\n到時trump想要乜條件都輕鬆deal"},{"pid":"1cc1055e58849dbbed546faffa61add9d0ab84a0","tid":834437,"uid":202464,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T08:04:04.000Z","msg":"具體即係點"},{"pid":"ceea610a84b6c253dcbb4e288a4a5fa240801b21","tid":834437,"uid":45518,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"1cc1055e58849dbbed546faffa61add9d0ab84a0","tid":834437,"uid":202464,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T08:04:04.000Z","msg":"具體即係點"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T08:21:55.000Z","msg":"具體就係唔想比你知佢具體會點做, 總之而家同你講佢咩手段都可以玩"},{"pid":"2486e08b0a3d03c2d0d6ad7e74f279d068b39f78","tid":834437,"uid":13663,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T08:46:17.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/scare.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d7dc35cb10ae45103f3081df59291262a5b8cc50","tid":834437,"uid":48083,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"ceea610a84b6c253dcbb4e288a4a5fa240801b21","tid":834437,"uid":45518,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"1cc1055e58849dbbed546faffa61add9d0ab84a0","tid":834437,"uid":202464,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T08:04:04.000Z","msg":"具體即係點"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T08:21:55.000Z","msg":"具體就係唔想比你知佢具體會點做, 總之而家同你講佢咩手段都可以玩"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T08:49:54.000Z","msg":"玩充公啲官既海外資產似真係驚<br />\n一出就召大使講野+出人民日報<br />\n收關稅都冇咁大反應"},{"pid":"7e7601460121a4686b56ce4a65fa890ab43a6ccc","tid":834437,"uid":57424,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T08:54:56.000Z","msg":"愈玩愈大，希望支支玩得起<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/10.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n本身諗住下個月開始入貨，都係儲反美股先隱陣<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/04.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c150318b35141ad7deb53594c719ef84cee7de71","tid":834437,"uid":84040,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T09:13:14.000Z","msg":"師公<img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4a0a37abefc74e52412c8040fda1f6963c64d117","tid":834437,"uid":171446,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T09:32:57.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"14389efd3162d1c1bf87c8438fa434115f7895b6","tid":834437,"uid":42921,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T09:33:07.000Z","msg":"未驚過，香港政府會全力支持<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/fight_connect.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/fight_connect.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/fight_connect.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/fight_connect.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/fight_connect.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/fight_connect.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"836a7c591dcd595223a6a39db722224c9479af4f","tid":834437,"uid":32722,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"4a0a37abefc74e52412c8040fda1f6963c64d117","tid":834437,"uid":171446,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"deddf8450ab09439e9d48146cbc392777381e146","tid":834437,"uid":32722,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T07:57:36.000Z","msg":"最好係凍結中國官員在美國的所有資產<br />\n到時trump想要乜條件都輕鬆deal"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T09:32:57.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T09:36:40.000Z","msg":"中國班十九官只為自己利益<br />\n一話凍結資產，鬥快獻某帝人頭俾美國都做得出"},{"pid":"566d3f15a93a4c6b3249af7d2bdda5ad41d0871d","tid":834437,"uid":34641,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"deddf8450ab09439e9d48146cbc392777381e146","tid":834437,"uid":32722,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T07:57:36.000Z","msg":"最好係凍結中國官員在美國的所有資產<br />\n到時trump想要乜條件都輕鬆deal"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-24T10:47:53.000Z","msg":"今次真係燒到啲官嘅話，好快扯白旗<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
