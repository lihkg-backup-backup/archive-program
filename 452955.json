Academic excellence is not celebrated, and residents perceived as focusing too heavily on their studies may be viewed as selfcentred. One student said that <span style=\"color: red;\">halls do not strive for excellence, but rather for mediocrity</span>, since the GPA threshold for readmission is set at only 2.0. Partly this is because <span style=\"color: red;\">sports and cultural activities loom so large in the culture of many halls, dominating student life from orientation camp forwards</span>......<br />\n<br />\n-&gt;住hall前要諗清楚,無時間讀書架<br />\n<br />\n7.6.5 <br />\nSome aspects of the <span style=\"color: red;\">&lsquo;seniority system&rsquo;</span>, whereby <span style=\"color: red;\">established hall residents come to dominate residential hall culture and control junior residents, were criticized by a number of students</span>. New residents face pressure to commit heavily to hall activities in order to meet readmission criteria. Despite this, <span style=\"color: red;\">senior students are insensitive to the immense pressure generated by hall activities, and are sometimes too <strong><ins>immature</ins></strong> for the mentorship roles they assume</span>. One student said there <strong><ins><span style=\"color: red;\">was too much &lsquo;verbal bullying&rsquo; from senior students</span></ins></strong>. Another said that while guidance from seniors is good,<span style=\"color: red;\"> it should not become oppressive</span>. This student felt that friendship would be enough from senior students.<br />\n<br />\n-&gt;邊位同學寫衰大仙?你以為無人知係你呀?大仙一早mark住喇<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/04.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n(<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/offtopic.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> offtopic問問如果開樓會個陣直接話大仙immature會有咩下場架?)"},{"pid":"71544dc5b368bffe3b6c633938096cd6ef190344","tid":452955,"uid":35870,"like":6,"dislike":0,"score":6,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-30T17:04:16.000Z","msg":"7.7.3 <br />\nAgainst this, an argument mostly revealed in the <span style=\"color: red;\">online feedback</span>(其中一個係咪我<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />) was that <span style=\"color: red;\">difference, diversity, inclusion and integration are either discouraged or not fully promoted in the residential halls</span>.
