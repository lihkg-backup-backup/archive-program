The reason behind this is if they managed to take over HKCU, they will have access to Hong Kong Internet Exchange ( HKIX), which is located within HKCU.<br />\n<br />\nThe HKIX serves as a hub to 99% messages that is sent and received through Internet within Hong Kong. If HKCU is fallen, every Hong Kongers' message will be monitored by Communist China and the puppet Hong Kong Government. <br />\n<br />\nWith China's A.I., MILLIONS of Hong Kongers will be sought out, arrested, raped, have livers and kidneys harvested etc. We will be vanished without a trace afterwards systematically.<br />\n<br />\nWe Hong Kongers are in the front line of the battle between the Free World and that of Communist Tyranny. Yet the rest of the world is just sitting back relaxed, watching and doing NOTHING except having pop corns.<br />\n<br />\nWhen you see this message, please at least share. Don't let our youngsters fight alone. We are in grave danger and it _IS_ time for the UN and the world to intervene immediately!"}]}
