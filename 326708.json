I had.always thought that many other countries were better than hong kong but after I went on holiday in lots of countries I realised that in terms of city life, nightlife, food and shopping hong kong really is the best. In europe shops close at four to five on weekdays and don't open at all except big cities like London where shops close at six on weekdays and four are weekends. Their main sorts of entertainment are pubs and clubs. Las vegas has spectacular night views but it was primarily built for tourism. It's famous for gambling, unique hotel design and shows like boxing events. However in terms of scenery Scandinavia and Tibet are the most ravishing I would say. Tibet is famous for its breathtaking scenery at high altitude. Xinjiang is also a place of outstanding scenic beauty. If you might have altitude sickness such as dizziness, headaches and trouble sleeping I suggest you bring some medicine along. A friend of mine who's just been to the Mount Everest base camp showed me her photos taken there by which I was awestruck. It's definitely a glamorous holiday destination. A tour of the base camo would be a once in a lifetime experience. Tibet is also the best place for stargazing because it's much closer to the heavens than any other places on earth and the sky at night is often clear and cloudless. It has some of the highest lakes in the world that are rich with fish and other marine life and the surrounding countryside is inhabited by flocks of yellow ducks as well as wild horses and donkeys. The lakes there such as Lake Paiku which is four thousand five hundred and ninety two metres above sea level reflect the beauty of the stars giving a double view of the sky at night. You can even set up a tent and camp there to get the best view of the stars and the milky way galaxy. If you go to Japan on vacation I heartily recommend climbing Mount Fuji which is a little off the beaten track even though you aren't staying in tokyo because the extra cost of traveling there is offset by a discount on the admission. It's an arduous task but the view is worth it. In fact my friend Joe who's been there showed me his photos by which I was awestruck. He said it was worth it for the view from the top and the confidence that hed gained afterwards. At night even though one of the nearby lakes dries up, the remaining lakes reflect the beauty of the stars and Mount Fuji giving a double view of the starry sky and the mountains. The outline of Mount Fuji is sharply defined against the starry nights by which you'll be awestruck. You can even pitch camp there to get the best of the night sky. Sometimes it's nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Again the low admission fee offsets the rising transportation fee so it's certainly worth a visit."}]}
