On Wednesday, Atalanta and Inter's officials held a meeting to discuss the future of the Swede, currently on loan at Parma.<br />\n<br />\nThe Nerazzurri's objective is to try and forestall the other suitors and close the deal with Atalanta, although the move would be postponed until next June as Parma have shown themselves unwilling to let the player go in January. In virtue of the excellent relationship between the chairmans of the clubs - Zhang and Percassi - Inter would like to agree a pre-emption on the player and then formally close the deal after the end of the January transfer window, from 1st February onwards. Inter would prefer to make the deal official - for a sum of &euro;35 million - only during the summer transfer window as their plan is to invest the funds for the January transfer window on players that would have an immediate impact on Conte's team.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, this matter could cause a problem in the path to a possible agreement as Atalanta would like to be able to sell the player already in January in case a high bid from a different club arrived, even though the move to another club would happen in the summer. Atalanta are open to wait for Inter (and they would accept the terms offered by the Nerazzurri), provided that no other club makes a higher bid and accepts Atalanta's conditions.

Batshuayi on loan from Chelsea<br />\n<br />\nOur colleagues at Foot Mercato report that Premier League strugglers Aston Villa have registered an interest in signing Belgian international forward Michy Batshuayi on loan from Chelsea this month.<br />\n<br />\nThe player has made 12 Premier League appearances this season but has yet to start a match in the division.<br />\n<br />\nBatshuayi&rsquo;s camp feel that this is not enough playing time, as he continues to look for stability following his exit from Marseille.<br />\n<br />\nThe 26-year-old Belgian international, with EURO 2020 on the horizon, is currently in a period of self-reflection about his future.<br />\n<br />\nVilla would like to sign him on loan with an option to buy &ndash; we now await to see what the player&rsquo;s position on the interest is and whether Batshuayi wants to go.<br />\n<br />\n<a

Internationally, Tosun chose to represent Turkey after playing between Under-16 and Under-21 levels for Germany, his country of birth. He featured for Turkey in their Euro 2016 campaign and finished as top scorer in the country's successful qualification for Euro 2020, and has now scored 16 goals from 40 international appearances.<br />\n<br />\nAfter Tosun put pen to paper in the half-season deal, Crystal Palace Chairman Steve Parish commented: &quot;We're delighted to have secured Cenk's services for the remainder of this season. We've enjoyed a great first half of the campaign and Cenk's arrival will bolster our squad as we push for a top-half Premier League finish. Cenk has a proven record as a goalscorer and we've admired him for some time, so I'm very pleased to welcome him to Crystal Palace.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nTosun has a wealth of experience at domestic level, having started his career with German side Eintracht Frankfurt before moving to S&uuml;per Lig team, Gaziantepspor. In his debut season with the Turkish club, the forward scored 10 goals from just 14 appearances and went on to net 49 times in 128 games. A highlight at Gaziantepspor came when Tosun bagged a brace in his club's Spot Toto Cup-winning final against Orduspor. <br />\n<br />\nTosun's proficiency earned him a transfer to Turkish giants Beşiktaş. With the Black Eagles, Tosun scored 24 times to retain the S&uuml;per Lig title in 2016/17. Having earned Champions League experience at Beşiktaş, Tosun moved to Everton in January 2018.
