We&rsquo;re hearing others are doing it, too, but no-one is going to go on parade that they are leaving,&rdquo; the adviser said. &ldquo;The fear is that the bar is coming right down on Beijing&rsquo;s ability to get your assets in Hong Kong. Singapore is the favored destination.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe extradition bill, which will cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or traveling through the city, has sparked unusually broad concern it may threaten the rule of law that underpins Hong Kong&rsquo;s international financial status.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong&rsquo;s Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, has stood by the bill, saying it is necessary to plug loopholes that allow criminals wanted on the mainland to use the city as a haven. She has said the courts would safeguard human rights.<br />\n<br />\nProtests and violence forced an initial legislative debate to be shelved last Wednesday and it is unclear when they would resume to pass the bill.<br />\n<br />\nIf the bill becomes law, it will be possible for mainland Chinese courts to request Hong Kong courts to freeze and confiscate assets related to crimes committed on the mainland, beyond an existing provision covering the proceeds of drug offences.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;This has been largely overlooked in the public debate but it is really a significant part of the proposed amendments,&rdquo; Young said. &ldquo;It may not have been overlooked, of course, by the tycoons and those giving them legal advice.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t mainland Chinese clients who might be politically exposed, but wealthy Hong Kong clients,&rdquo; the banker said. <strong><span style=\"color: red;\">&ldquo;The situation in Hong Kong is out of control. They can&rsquo;t believe that Carrie Lam or Beijing leaders are so stupid that they don&rsquo;t realize the economic damage from this.&rdquo;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\nThe amendments seek to simplify case-by-case extraditions to jurisdictions, including mainland China, beyond the 20 with which Hong Kong already has extradition treaties.<br />\n<br />\nAccording a recent Hong Kong Bar Association study, the MLAO allows foreign jurisdictions to ask Hong Kong authorities to gather evidence for use outside the city &ldquo;and to render other forms of assistance, such as freezing and confiscating the assets of persons wanted for crimes in other jurisdictions&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nSearch, seizure and confiscation can involve cases with a penalty of two years in prison or more, compared with the threshold of seven years for extraditions under the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, the submission notes. Requests can also be made at the investigative rather than prosecution stage.<br />\n<br />\nProminent commercial lawyer Kevin Yam said he was aware of high net-worth Hong Kong figures taking steps to move assets to Singapore as they matured or market conditions proved favorable.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;At this point I would say it is a steady trickle rather than stampede but is most definitely happening,&rdquo; he said.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">&ldquo;It is great for Singapore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And such an own goal for Hong Kong.&rdquo;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-extradition-capitalflight-ex/exclusive-hong-kong-tycoons-start-moving-assets-offshore-as-fears-rise-over-new-extradition-law-idUSKCN1TF1DZ?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR3vYl9g-sVXcdHcgfICg9LM2F6PxE0tkmEZnGuk0rnyPAy3J6aXnZ9fk3s\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-hongkong-extradition-capitalflight-ex%2Fexclusive-hong-kong-tycoons-start-moving-assets-offshore-as-fears-rise-over-new-extradition-law-idUSKCN1TF1DZ%3Futm_medium%3DSocial%26utm_source%3DFacebook%26fbclid%3DIwAR3vYl9g-sVXcdHcgfICg9LM2F6PxE0tkmEZnGuk0rnyPAy3J6aXnZ9fk3s&d=YB8lrFeyQ%2BkzHCEHpdql8GlQkZRBUTTGMtnLt8L03NM%3D&h=fb8694ac\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-hongkong-extradition-capitalflight-ex%2Fexclusive-hong-kong-tycoons-start-moving-assets-offshore-as-fears-rise-over-new-extradition-law-idUSKCN1TF1DZ%3Futm_medium%3DSocial%26utm_source%3DFacebook%26fbclid%3DIwAR3vYl9g-sVXcdHcgfICg9LM2F6PxE0tkmEZnGuk0rnyPAy3J6aXnZ9fk3s&h=020ad0af\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-extradition-capitalflight-ex/exclusive-hong-kong-tycoons-start-moving-assets-offshore-as-fears-rise-over-new-extradition-law-idUSKCN1TF1DZ?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR3vYl9g-sVXcdHcgfICg9LM2F6PxE0tkmEZnGuk0rnyPAy3J6aXnZ9fk3s</a>"},{"pid":"69de368ce57f8df528990432953e10a8c0b29966","tid":1223367,"uid":166785,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-06-14T16:34:51.000Z","msg":"可唔可以有埋我走"},{"pid":"541e38ce9a1998a000369677fd2adb4c6a8b1679","tid":1223367,"uid":216417,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"69de368ce57f8df528990432953e10a8c0b29966","tid":1223367,"uid":166785,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-06-14T16:34:51.000Z","msg":"可唔可以有埋我走"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-15T00:04:41.000Z","msg":"爸爸<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ed992cd27886b10b9b852bd5ca6238b7005860a0","tid":1223367,"uid":172627,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"69de368ce57f8df528990432953e10a8c0b29966","tid":1223367,"uid":166785,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-06-14T16:34:51.000Z","msg":"可唔可以有埋我走"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-15T00:21:30.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
