Since I don't know how to type in Chinese, this post will be in English.<br />\nNow the policemen has used brutality in an attempt to stop us, I suggest we should outwit them in our next stage of action, but I will be vague in case some policemen has infiltrated this website. So the the first thing we need is an underground communication network to plan our actions.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the things we can do is to borrow from The Thirty-Six Stratagems and try to confuse the policemen. We can also do what the Viet Cong and the Chinese Red Army does best to fight.<br />\n<br />\nI also went to 4chan to get some protesting tips and got some helpful tips from others. Too bad I won't tell all of them here since there is some Policemen there. If you want to learn about this, go to /pol/ in 4chan, where I will be posting them once the response is huge enough, or DM me.<br />\n<br />\nThat's most what I know about our next actions"}]}
