More than 30 years later, full democracy in Hong Kong has not been achieved yet. At first, universal suffrage of Chief Executive (CE) and Legislative Council (LegCo) in 2007 and 2008 is promised in the Basic Law. However, the Standing Committee of the National People&rsquo;s Congress (NPCSC) rejected this promise in 2004. Then, NPCSC stated that CE candidate must be nominated by at least half of the nominating committee members in 2014, which was criticized as a &lsquo;de facto&rsquo; filtering of CE candidates. NPCSC claimed its decisions were in accordance with the actual situation in Hong Kong and the principle of gradual and orderly progress. This essay will argue Hong Kong and Hong Kongers are ready for full democracy.<br />\n<br />\nThis essay will first argue Hong Kong is ready for full democracy with modernization approach. Modernization is often seen as booster of democratization and it can &ldquo;operate in favor of both the emergence and the survival of democracy.&rdquo; Christian Welzel concluded that modernization includes urbanization, social diversification, occupational specialization, productivity growth, rising levels of prosperity and income, more widely accessible information, rising literacy rates and level of education, more technological advancement in people&rsquo;s equipment, intellectually demanding professions and available infrastructure, including means of communication and transportation, etc. <br />\n<br />\nAccording to Ronny Tong in 2007, the legislator, he argued that Hong Kong had already attained the precondition of democracy, such as being one of the very few international financial centres, acquiring rule of law and freedom of the press, containing a very good banking system and high level of education like the existing 8 universities. Then, scholar Yang Hengjun supported it by stating that firstly, Hong Kong has achieved a high level of economy. Secondly, Hong Kongers have a considerably high literacy level. Thirdly, Hong Kongers have basic understanding of politics with several decades of democratization in Hong Kong. Finally, Hong Kong has a mature system establishing the rule of law and Hong Kongers enjoy sufficient freedoms. Also, Professor Larry Diamond acknowledged that Hong Kong had the requirements of sustainable democracy like a mature economy, experience with elections, rule of law and civil society. Finally, legislator Regina Ip agreed Hong Kong could be ready for full democracy by stating that Hong Kong had a predominance of social workers, trade union and labour. So that, Hong Kongers are ready for full democracy by modernization approach.<br />\n<br />\nBased on the actual situation in Hong Kong and the principle of gradual and orderly progress, the latest political reform in 2014 stated that universal suffrage of LegCo should be implemented after the universal suffrage of CE and CE candidates must be screened by pro-Beijing majority nominating committee in 2017. Some people may argue that the political reform clearly informed that Hong Kong is not ready for full democracy after 20 years of handover."},{"pid":"ec51882860a8adb367070c1fadc807ee8042986a","tid":749718,"uid":70063,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:06:02.000Z","msg":"In reply to this objection, Hong Kong governor actually planned to introduce popular election in early 1950s. However, China threatened to &lsquo;liberate&rsquo; Hong Kong if the colonial government introduced electoral democracy in Hong Kong as China evaluated it was conspiracy and a very unfriendly act which could set Hong Kong on a path to independence. Then, governor Chris Patten introduced political reform on LegCo in 1995 which was akin to the universal suffrage of LegCo. In his political reform on the LegCo, direct seats would be increased from 18 to 20, the individuals working in professions or specified business sectors in 21 existing functional constituencies were given a vote rather than their companies, Hong Kongers who did not belong to existing functional constituencies would be represented in the nine new functional constituencies, appointments of district boards and the municipal councils were replaced by direct elections, and ten legislators who were elected from all the directly elected members of the district boards. However, although the Patten&rsquo;s political reform theoretically complied with the &lsquo;through train&rsquo; which set out in the Basic Law, China stopped the &ldquo;through train&rdquo; as China claimed the political reform violated the Basic Law, Joint Declaration and various understandings over political developments reached between the UK and China. So that, Hongkongese should have enjoyed universal suffrage since 1950s and after handover but it was stopped by China.<br />\n<br />\nAnother reason to prove Hong Kongers are ready for full democracy is their strong wills to democracy. In 1989, million Hongkongese marched to support Chinese students democracy movement in Beijing. Many protesters wore shirts with written words &lsquo;Long Live the Democratic Movement&rsquo;. Then, the democrats like United Democrats had a landslide victory on LegCo geographical constituencies election in 1991 and 1995 which demonstrated Hong Kongers were aggressive to democratization. Next, according to the Hong Kong University Public Opinion Programme in 2007, 60-70% of Hongkongese wanted universal suffrage to be implemented as soon as possible. Also, near 800 thousand Hong Kongers voted in &lsquo;6.22 Civil Referendum&rsquo;, which was an unofficial plebiscite held by civil society, to express their opinion towards different democratic CE election reforms in June 2014. Moreover, according to a survey from Centre for Communication and Public Opinion Survey on 18 December 2014, over one-fifth of Hong Kongers had participated in Umbrella Movement, which lasted for 79 days, to fight for Hong Kong democracy. So that, those incidents demonstrated Hongkongese&rsquo; strong wills to full democracy over several decades and they are ready for full democracy.<br />\n <br />\nIn conclusion, Hong Kongers are ready for full democracy by modernization approach, their strong wills to democracy, etc."},{"pid":"5bfb82d68adc579341fdfd9bb11817faa8e9e501","tid":749718,"uid":89514,"like":3,"dislike":7,"score":-4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:09:03.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"813db09073786e8baa6c3b30782731070b585802","tid":749718,"uid":170229,"like":3,"dislike":5,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:18:11.000Z","msg":"no<br />\n民主咗，啲奸商依然會賣港；建制派依然會成功用 蛇齋餅糭買票；政客依然會要你和班非；垃圾家長依然會教出啲垃圾細路玩抖音，含中國撚"},{"pid":"34a2af50feb2b1c2de667941deb0da440ef3ba12","tid":749718,"uid":41245,"like":12,"dislike":0,"score":12,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:25:51.000Z","msg":"得啦得啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/z.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/z.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/z.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n又係啲唔配乜乜物物<br />\n你個人咁on9唔配生存添呀<br />\n根本現實就冇個選擇係可以唔民主<br />\n反民主只係支持特權嘅代表詞，啫係支持授權權力畀堆冇認受性嘅人<br />\n依個邏輯係華人口中講出嚟特別on9"},{"pid":"766b2442aab02cc82c9ebc609b5c0a8823357d93","tid":749718,"uid":94388,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:27:44.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6%E7%9A%84%E8%87%B4%E5%91%BD%E7%BC%BA%E9%99%B7/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthestandnews.com%2Fpolitics%2F%25E6%25B0%2591%25E4%25B8%25BB%25E5%2588%25B6%25E5%25BA%25A6%25E7%259A%2584%25E8%2587%25B4%25E5%2591%25BD%25E7%25BC%25BA%25E9%2599%25B7%2F&d=GFpYaXrnPOrAikmqtyFSsqMP9SZiTpIcsXSGftWU1%2BE%3D&h=fd682519\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthestandnews.com%2Fpolitics%2F%25E6%25B0%2591%25E4%25B8%25BB%25E5%2588%25B6%25E5%25BA%25A6%25E7%259A%2584%25E8%2587%25B4%25E5%2591%25BD%25E7%25BC%25BA%25E9%2599%25B7%2F&h=34836a03\" target=\"_blank\">https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6%E7%9A%84%E8%87%B4%E5%91%BD%E7%BC%BA%E9%99%B7/</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.kpwan.com/news/viewNewsPost.do?id=690\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kpwan.com%2Fnews%2FviewNewsPost.do%3Fid%3D690&d=GFpYaXrnPOrAikmqtyFSsqMP9SZiTpIcsXSGftWU1%2BE%3D&h=903f4935\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.kpwan.com/news/viewNewsPost.do?id=690</a>"},{"pid":"f843cfaa12833bb59713c10bf5c6077dc9b62710","tid":749718,"uid":24140,"like":4,"dislike":2,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"813db09073786e8baa6c3b30782731070b585802","tid":749718,"uid":170229,"like":3,"dislike":5,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:18:11.000Z","msg":"no<br />\n民主咗，啲奸商依然會賣港；建制派依然會成功用 蛇齋餅糭買票；政客依然會要你和班非；垃圾家長依然會教出啲垃圾細路玩抖音，含中國撚"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:34:24.000Z","msg":"民主本身就會自我修正"},{"pid":"9b09ab2b6c13a1b7011b4a09eb997c5c39e15bce","tid":749718,"uid":170229,"like":1,"dislike":2,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"f843cfaa12833bb59713c10bf5c6077dc9b62710","tid":749718,"uid":24140,"like":4,"dislike":2,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"813db09073786e8baa6c3b30782731070b585802","tid":749718,"uid":170229,"like":3,"dislike":5,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:18:11.000Z","msg":"no<br />\n民主咗，啲奸商依然會賣港；建制派依然會成功用 蛇齋餅糭買票；政客依然會要你和班非；垃圾家長依然會教出啲垃圾細路玩抖音，含中國撚"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:34:24.000Z","msg":"民主本身就會自我修正"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:43:29.000Z","msg":"Care to elaborate?"},{"pid":"c70f0bfa7e556c5a0c7aaf494c8e3a07c833a18b","tid":749718,"uid":89514,"like":0,"dislike":5,"score":-5,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T11:15:08.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"19fb7b399112841ce9f44b70370f1b55c9dddba1","tid":749718,"uid":38194,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T11:20:04.000Z","msg":"我屌你老母呀"},{"pid":"de0472f8f91f693467085ef48b6d2e6078bd2f86","tid":749718,"uid":24140,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"c70f0bfa7e556c5a0c7aaf494c8e3a07c833a18b","tid":749718,"uid":89514,"like":0,"dislike":5,"score":-5,"quote":{"pid":"f843cfaa12833bb59713c10bf5c6077dc9b62710","tid":749718,"uid":24140,"like":4,"dislike":2,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"813db09073786e8baa6c3b30782731070b585802","tid":749718,"uid":170229,"like":3,"dislike":5,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:18:11.000Z","msg":"no<br />\n民主咗，啲奸商依然會賣港；建制派依然會成功用 蛇齋餅糭買票；政客依然會要你和班非；垃圾家長依然會教出啲垃圾細路玩抖音，含中國撚"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T09:34:24.000Z","msg":"民主本身就會自我修正"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T11:15:08.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T11:26:10.000Z","msg":"借用英國二戰首相既一段話：<br />\nMany forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe.
