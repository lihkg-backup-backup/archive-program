There's been so many disinfo and myths and I just wanna share my thought for discussion. This is from another retail trader and i'm merely translating his words into English and post it here.<br />\n<br />\nAuthor position: Diamond hands 325@213.0934<br />\n<br />\nMyth 1. Has the SS been squoze on Jan26 when prices hit 450+?<br />\nNO. Critical indicators of shorts covering are: Hiking turnover rates, prices, and volume. I mean, look at the fucking volume. The trading volume on 26th was significantly lower than that of the previous 3 trading days (21st, 22nd, and 25th). Lowering turnover rates and prices since 26th further prompted that people are not selling shit, but shorties continue to short the hell out of it; Therefore, I suspect the current SI% could be even higher than 226% (SI% on Jan 15).<br />\n<br />\nMyth 2. Can shorties hedge their positions by longing call options?<br />\nNO. ITM call options would cause market makers to hedge their positions by purchasing the underlying share which results in price uplift (Gamma squeeze). This is what WE want shorties to do but they just won&rsquo;t do it.<br />\n<br />\nMyth 3. Can shorties cover their shorts trading back and forth?<br />\nNO. If we don&rsquo;t sell, they are not covering shit. They initiate short ladder attacks trying to demolish our heuristics and throw our shares away. The true value that they have to pay for their absurdity is nowhere near the current market price. This is the chance when WE get to set the price by limiting supply, not THEM.<br />\n<br />\nMyth 4. Omg the current price is so low; Shorties are covering their shorts at low costs!!<br />\nNO. Same logic, they are trying to fool us on the fair value by countless shitty price offerings with new shorts (short ladder) and counterfeited shares. It&rsquo;s simple af, we don&rsquo;t sell at bad prices. We get to set the price when they are forced to buy to cover their shorts. THEY ARE NOT COVERING ANY SHIT IF WE DON&rsquo;T FUCKING SELL.<br />\n<br />\nTLDR: They are NOT covering shit. The current price is a joke. Short Squeeze will happen if we don&rsquo;t sell.💎🖐🏻🚀🌕"},{"pid":"9825ca492b978d97150c09bffa1d388981e9cf1c","tid":2395915,"uid":118346,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T08:14:56.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld2drq/gme_bearish_myths_debunked_credits_to_zack_gmesh/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Fld2drq%2Fgme_bearish_myths_debunked_credits_to_zack_gmesh%2F&d=GtJgxCFvwMhqeg%2B2Fxb9Ed5VMZmAwfp0CD4JwUII9h4%3D&h=b8c0d0c8\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld2drq/gme_bearish_myths_debunked_credits_to_zack_gmesh/</a>"},{"pid":"c72794316f65c06822d5ee89e5e879e0ea139cc4","tid":2395915,"uid":237487,"like":3,"dislike":1,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T08:25:35.000Z","msg":"淡友表示 唔識英文"},{"pid":"f6a87fd75bc92ca2cce8666fa769e83df2191c02","tid":2395915,"uid":117318,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T08:25:40.000Z","msg":"社工: 班SH撚又水人入市，成班傻散以為洋腸香啲<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/nope.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1a05d1eac3b6d3d57d0b64375f6c710a50aabcf2","tid":2395915,"uid":370897,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T08:27:06.000Z","msg":"傻人發現案"},{"pid":"bdec21eb930c1c5b2c6ee7c26902e3a0c16d6750","tid":2395915,"uid":252993,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T08:28:08.000Z","msg":"由483跌到落49都唔叫崩盤<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"faa48ecf61d3f89ee379371c5cfebed7e826e5a9","tid":2395915,"uid":120918,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T08:30:01.000Z","msg":"啱<br />\nshort ladder attack嚟姐<br />\nsh👍"},{"pid":"0da8fa67cf01daa37dda1e4052f4c340c9df54a2","tid":2395915,"uid":10023,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T08:31:03.000Z","msg":"成班傻閪以為鬼佬唔會玩膠<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ac031baf69adb0a4180e73564f048b65756e5e22","tid":2395915,"uid":46720,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T08:32:02.000Z","msg":"過個價100再搵我<img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/pray.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"82a00a6762fbd766219b8634953310540157a8f3","tid":2395915,"uid":94454,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T08:32:38.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"56f151be15292628a3720c5b700e90a915c061fc","tid":2395915,"uid":110851,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T08:38:02.000Z","msg":"1. 如果short squeeze係25/1發生呢？即係由88升上158再插落嚟61嗰日<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n45分鐘內有4000幾萬股成交咗"},{"pid":"0b0a505fb2e17c105be4ded36b8b90ac85f3fbb5","tid":2395915,"uid":118346,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T12:22:15.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"cfb7414b86de749942b40cc0b6f3b96bbd68e7c9","tid":2395915,"uid":35831,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-05T12:23:46.000Z","msg":"而家一折<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
