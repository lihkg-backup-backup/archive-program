As the Scriptures say, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work.<br />\n<br />\n願你嘅判斷能夠喺法庭上顯現，縱使人會有失誤，依靠神，我地可以得到公義。<br />\n<br />\nIt is our request that your judgment be manifest in court, though men are fallible, through You justice can be has.<br />\n<br />\n求你賜福予從民間選出嘅陪審團裡面每一個成員。幫助佢地，令佢地能夠頭腦清晰，講嘢有自信，行動有勇氣。教佢地要依靠耐心、真理同埋愛，去為社群完成高尚嘅重任。<br />\n<br />\nBless the Members of the people's penal of Jurors. Help them to think clearly, speak confidently, and act courageously in the belief that all noble service is based upon patience, truth, and love.<br />\n<br />\n主啊，萬民喺你嘅磐石上建國。既然天父叫呢九位公民報效我國，請比佢地一切所需嘅恩典去辦別你嘅聲音，喺本土撒下正義正氣嘅種子，來為萬世開太平。奉主耶穌的名求，阿門。<br />\n<br />\nYou are the rock of which nations were found. Since You have called these nine citizens to serve our Nation, grant them all the gifts they need to discern Your holy will and to sow the seeds of justice and integrity for the future of Hong Kong.
