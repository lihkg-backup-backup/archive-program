The police officer never verbally warned that he will use a live round to shoot at the protestors. This clearly violates the rules and regulations for the use of lethal force.<br />\n<br />\n2. He chose the most lethal position of the victim to shoot while he has various kinds of choice even if he was forced to shoot. In the video, we can see that the protestor was on the right-hand side of the police officer originally (from the police officer's point of view). If the police officer believes he had an imminent threat of death, he should shoot the protestor at the FASTEST speed and choose a LESS-LETHAL position to shoot. <br />\nIn this case, the FASTEST way to shoot the protestor is to shoot his right torso, right hand or right leg. Also, the LESS-LETHAL positions are also on the right-hand side of the protestor.<br />\nHowever, the police officer decided to move his hand further towards the heart, which is located on the left-hand side of the protestor and fired a live round. This action is SLOWER AND MOST LETHAL and it violates the rules and regulations of use of firearms. CT scan and X-ray images showed that the bullet is just about 3cm from his heart and the main artery. <br />\n<br />\n3. The police officer himself is clearly not having an imminent threat of death. The protestor did not even hit his forearm with the rod. Instead, he just hit the officer's thick protective clothing. If the protestor did hit the officer's forearm with force, the officer's hand will be pushed downwards instead of staying straight. Even if he really hit the police officer's forearm directly, if we do not see the officer's hand being pushed downwards, it must be a light force (simple physics) and it is clearly not an imminent threat of death.<br />\n<br />\n4. The officer being hit on the ground has not suffered any serious injuries, so it is absolutely not an imminent threat of death for him too. If you look at the later part of the video, he stood up and returned to his team swiftly without showing any sense of serious injuries.<br />\n<br />\n5. The police officer has a less-lethal weapon on his left hand, and he has pepper spray with him. He can use his rubber bullet / sponge bullet gun to shoot at the protestors from his original position, which is 5 meters away from the protestors (look at the 0:00 of City University Student Press video). But he decided to use his revolver and run towards the protestors. Firstly, he used his leg to kick towards the victim while pointing the revolver at him, then the victim stroke back with a metal rod.
