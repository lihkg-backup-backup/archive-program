I admitted that the Government's work over the amendment exercise was deficient and I personally have to shoulder much of the responsibility.<br />\n<br />\nI have to emphasise that the deficiencies lie in my less than adequate judgement of the sensitivity of the subject matter and the handling of the process.  I wish to extend my gratitude to colleagues in the Security Bureau and Department of Justice for their dedication and professionalism.<br />\n<br />\nServing the public is my lifelong career and I remain committed to lead.  This incident had made me realise that, as CE, I still have much to learn and do in better balancing diverse interest, in listening more to all walks of life and in taking our society forward.<br />\n<br />\nFor colleagues working in the Tamar CGO, I am sorry for the disruption and inconvenience caused with the closure of the offices over the past few days.  For Police colleagues, I am indebted to them for their devoted service as always and am saddened to see the tension caused between policemen and protesters.  For everyone of you, the anxiety caused is deeply regretted.<br />\n<br />\nLet's hope the rift in society could be quickly mended and trust in the governing team could be restored through our hard work.  I look to you for your continued support.<br />\n<br />\nYours sincerely,<br />\nCarrie Lam"},{"pid":"263ca27fbb235a8289fb2ba2cc38b0f2b276a28a","tid":1242289,"uid":55005,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-19T04:37:22.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"db741e88e6759847eb27c8517819467e78fcc4ae","tid":1242289,"uid":31076,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-19T10:38:39.000Z","msg":"我都收到依封信<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"cce92f4ccc80118f334f5a443d34e3b93b2d41ec","tid":1242289,"uid":5807,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-20T01:02:52.000Z","msg":"有中文版"}]}
