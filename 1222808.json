Yes, Curry Lam gives the ultimate nod for violence, but she is not asking for out of control baton attacks, using pepper spray against recommended regulations, firing plastic bullets at unarmed people, who are moving away, attacking the press, assaulting people who are compliant or injured, using shields as offensive weapons, or any other number of violent and illegal policing that is on full, public display. These commanders took on the job and they can and should be held publicly accountable for their actions. \nAs I write, these commanders are planning operations to counter more protests this weekend. Most probably with more violence, not less. \nThey are morally accountable for their actions. Disciplined service officers can refuse assignments. They have the choice to say, this assignment is not for me. I have a young family, I'm integrated into the community, this will be too inflammatory. For the sake of my family I will not do this. You will have to find someone else. But, this doesn't happen. Instead, they accept it, bask in it, then rally their closeted communities to protect them when large swathes of the community demand they own it. \nThe HK Rugby Association is a good place to start.</code></pre><br />\nE個居港外藉writer 一直有報開香港抗爭新聞，佢facebook 仲用左天倚BB做profile pic添。<br />\n岩先係facebook 見到佢捉左兩個西人出呢屌，話佢地係食班只想食香港退休金既屎忽鬼，幾個post都同成件事有關，而且全部都係英文，有時個writer 會係comment 補返幾句<br />\n有興趣既巴絲可以追吓post，但我見到有條友係comment用中文總結左少少野就直接copy 過呢<br />\n<pre><code data-type=\"\">E個外國writer 話圖中兩個鬼佬好可能係今次落命令警方用暴力方式打人既commander。(半firm?)\n佢篤左出呢之後係西貢fusion買野，比對方家眷為難。\n佢指出西貢有一班西人，大部份都係ex-HK police，而且 The HK Rugby Association 同佢地關係深厚。\n佢一個人無法子係香港西人社會做到D咩，佢建議香港人用中文向 The HK Rugby Association 聯署，捉個兩個鬼佬屌(鬧)又好、要求佢地表態又好反對警方使用過度武力又好，總之咁做可以比返D demage 個兩件賣港西人。</code></pre>"},{"pid":"a7fbc9b03ca9a67f35e13f1b21392680462c5cc0","tid":1222808,"uid":191231,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-14T14:18:41.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RichScotford5/posts/1856842841083690?__tn__=-R\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRichScotford5%2Fposts%2F1856842841083690%3F__tn__%3D-R&d=Q%2BwKghBkVpQFldJLXg3PjUy%2FESo4xB68IG1t9wT0pkU%3D&h=d9394687\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/RichScotford5/posts/1856842841083690?__tn__=-R</a><br />\n「<br />\nHave received lots of posts and messages suggesting contacting UK Gov about these Pension Sellout Pigs.
