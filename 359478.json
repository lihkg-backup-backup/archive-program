The Elizabeth Tower, home to the Great Clock and Big Ben, is currently undergoing a complex programme of renovation work that will safeguard it for future generations. While this vital work takes place, the Great Bell&rsquo;s world famous striking will be paused until 2021 to ensure the safety of those working in the Tower. <br />\n<br />\nSteve Jaggs, Keeper of the Great Clock, said:<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Big Ben falling silent is a significant milestone in this crucial conservation project. As Keeper of the Great Clock I have the great honour of ensuring this beautiful piece of Victorian engineering is in top condition on a daily basis. This essential programme of works will safeguard the clock on a long term basis, as well as protecting and preserving its home &ndash; the Elizabeth Tower. Members of the public are welcome to mark this important moment by gathering in Parliament Square to hear Big Ben&rsquo;s final bongs until they return in 2021.&rdquo;<br />\nThe Great Bell, popularly called Big Ben, weighs 13.7 tonnes and strikes every hour to the note of E. It is accompanied by four quarter bells, which chime every 15 minutes, which will also cease for the works. Big Ben has marked the hour with almost unbroken service for the past 157 years. The bongs last fell silent for maintenance in 2007, and prior to that between 1983-5 as part of a previous large scale refurbishment programme. <br />\n<br />\nThe Great Clock is operated by a custom built Victorian clockwork mechanism, which relies on gravity to trigger the renowned bongs. To stop the bells the striking hammers will be locked and the bell disconnected from the clock mechanism, allowing the Great Clock to continue telling the time silently. Parliament&rsquo;s specialist clock makers will ensure that Big Ben can still bong for important national events such as New Year&rsquo;s Eve and Remembrance Sunday. The bells will resume their regular time keeping duties in the course of 2021.<br />\n<br />\nConservation<br />\n<br />\nThe conservation project started earlier this year, with the start of scaffolding works. Once this scaffolding reaches the necessary height, work will begin at the very top of the Tower with the renovation of the Ayrton Light (which shines to show that Parliament is sitting) and the refurbishment of the cast iron roofing. <br />\n<br />\nThe team will then work their way down the building, removing scaffolding as they go, and tackling a wide range of the complex issues created by the height and heritage of this unique landmark.<br />\n<br />\nThe Great Clock<br />\n<br />\nAs part of this intricate series of works, the Great Clock itself will be dismantled piece by piece with each cog examined and restored. The four dials will be carefully cleaned, the glass repaired, the cast iron framework renewed, and the hands will be removed and refurbished.<br />\n<br />\nWhilst the Great Clock and the dials are undergoing conservation, it will be necessary to cover the faces for some time. However, to ensure that the public are still able to set their watches by this most important of time pieces, one working clock face will remain visible at all times throughout the works. As the clock mechanism itself will be temporarily out of action, a modern electric motor will drive the clock hands until the Great Clock is reinstated.<br />\n<br />\n<a

/>\n聞名於世的英國倫敦地標「大笨鐘」將於當地時間下周一（21日）起進行修葺，預計至2021年完成。為時4年的工程期間，大笨鐘會在大部分時間停響，成為它啟用157年來「失聲」最久的時期。<br />\n<br />\n重13.7噸的大笨鐘每小時都會敲響，而它所在的鐘樓上另外4個較小的鐘，亦會每15分鐘敲響報時，報時鐘聲因被英國廣播公司（BBC）播放而為人熟悉。鐘聲會在當地時間下周一（21日）中午12時（本港時間晚上7時）最後一次響起，之後就會陷入長達4年的寂靜，屆時大笨鐘的鐘面亦將被遮蓋。<br />\n<br />\n不過，國會表示為讓人可以從大笨鐘得知準確時間及調校鐘表，工程期間任何時候都會留有一個正常運作的鐘面讓公眾觀看。而在重要日子如新年前夕，當局亦會讓大笨鐘重新鳴響。<br />\n<br />\n修葺工程費用預計高達2900萬英鎊（約2.94億港元），其間大笨鐘的指針和齒輪都會被一一取下檢查和清潔，而整個鐘的機械會暫時失效，但為維持最少一個鐘面正常運作，當局會暫時安裝一個電動摩打讓指針繼續轉動，直至修葺完成。<br />\n<br />\n（路透社/法新社）<br />\n<br />\n<a
