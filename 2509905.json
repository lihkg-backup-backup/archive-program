If implemented, the proposal would be a huge win for anti-tobacco advocates who have long seen flavored cigarettes as a way for consumers to be introduced to smoking. The vast majority of Black smokers favor menthol cigarette brands. Black men currently have the highest rates of lung cancer in the country.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday that it will propose a ban on menthol-flavored cigarettes in the United States, which would be a huge blow to future tobacco sales.<br />\n<br />\nMenthol is the last allowable flavor for cigarettes. According to the FDA, menthol cigarettes have been disproportionately used by youth, people of color and low-income communities. The vast majority of Black smokers favor menthol cigarette brands, and Black men currently have the highest rates of lung cancer in the country.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;With these actions, the FDA will help significantly reduce youth initiation, increase the chances of smoking cessation among current smokers, and address health disparities experienced by communities of color, low-income populations, and LGBTQ+ individuals, all of whom are far more likely to use these tobacco products,&rdquo; said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, in a press release.<br />\n<br />\nThis decision was in response to a citizens&rsquo; petition filed in 2013. A court had ordered a response by the agency by Thursday.<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/scratching.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4e8c2ea38f21f6d9fde9974ee7a5b82795df748d","tid":2509905,"uid":17008,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-04-29T19:05:15.000Z","msg":"而家d人轉曬吸 綠豆雲呢拿 應該無影響？"},{"pid":"7c8aa6e11a652e69a140668167e0736600ae11e0","tid":2509905,"uid":293943,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-04-29T19:07:44.000Z","msg":"跟英國 <img src=\"/assets/faces/cow/power.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0a4bf918b339b3841964b38b54f499aa0987a7e0","tid":2509905,"uid":10056,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-04-29T19:07:48.000Z","msg":"禁薄荷煙純粹因為佢易入口<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />?咁矛盾禁哂佢呀笨"},{"pid":"1e0053771026a22b9ca8e2905010435aae2bedf7","tid":2509905,"uid":337336,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-04-29T19:14:29.000Z","msg":"薄荷仔要絕種了？<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/diu.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e9edaed9e9e6a95c459d4199fe737c546531a212","tid":2509905,"uid":35296,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-04-29T19:16:08.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/@.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/@.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/@.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
