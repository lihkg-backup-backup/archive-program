I took him there not only because I wanted them to see the lucky man or wanted him to be seduced. I knew someone would leak the news to my dad. He would learn how CP2 looked like, how he did in front of those sexy girls, did he smoke or drink a lot or were his eyes taken off by sexy girls and so on. It&rsquo;s more convincing than describing him by myself. <br />\n<br />\nCP performed quite well without knowing this arrangement beforehand. In fact I wanted to see how he&rsquo;d do in the club. If he forgot my existence and flirted with my girls I&rsquo;d cut his little CP off. <img src=\"/assets/faces/cat/swipe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMy dad at least was convinced afterwards CP was not as bad as he thought. More importantly he looked mature enough to handle our relationship with my background. Not many men had knowledge about this yet kept away from it. <br />\n<br />\nI asked dad and mom for approval to marry him. Dad didn&rsquo;t approve or reject it. Yet he asked CP to come to Thailand to see him and he would see. Knowing this important appointment, CP was so nervous and kept saying fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck <img src=\"/assets/faces/cat/annoyed.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\nhe chose to be frank to my parents. It was not easy for him to expose his past in front of us. It turned out to be a happy ending. Mom was actually touched by his courage.

I decided to touch her private part tenderly by my fingers. It was moist, warm and soft. <br />\n<br />\nI could not imagine I felt excited by doing so. My fingers moved from her &ldquo;lips&rdquo; to the clitoris. Her breath started to become heavier, and her hands grabbed my arms tightly. She moaned so seductively to tell me her source of pleasure.

My oldest sis isn&rsquo;t into this and doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to do so. my youngest sis is too young to do things.<br />\n<br />\nIn such business the girls know how to make money. You make the boss happy you get more opportunities. I did not directly involve in the management but they knew I was above the line management. They&rsquo;d definitely try to make me happy. Nevertheless because of my instincts or sympathy towards to disadvantaged, I paid more attention to those very young girls or new to the business who tended to be silent and invisible among those stars and high-fliers. <br />\n<br />\nWhenever I visited the venue I brought some candies and make ups for them. I accompanied them to go check up for STDs as they mostly didn&rsquo;t have much idea about them. They were scared about blood taking and avoided it. If I went with them they&rsquo;d have no escape. I&rsquo;d tell them the importance of doing so. <br />\n<br />\nSome of them were too shy to make any money. In most cases they&rsquo;d be fired after a short time. I wasn&rsquo;t there to mess up the business so they had to go but I&rsquo;d give them some pocket money to go home. <br />\n<br />\nSome girls tried to escape from bad customers. I&rsquo;d ask the management to see if they&rsquo;re really bad or if the girls were trying to filter customers. For those who try to cheat, they&rsquo;d be dealt with. For those genuinely poor girls, I&rsquo;d take them out for a drink or meal. Some of them especially young girls coming to Bangkok alone really wanted a shelter for a night. I booked a room for them.<br />\n<br />\nA girl who was so scared hugged me in the bed to try to sleep. Her skin was so soft and tender. I didn&rsquo;t know I was attracted by her.

To him, this man has slept with many girls and he would think whether my daughter would become one of them only. I can't imagine how CP can pass this difficult task and gain the permission.

I believe sis can write a equally good story in her perspective. It&rsquo;s totally different from man&rsquo;s that we have lots of emotions and fantasies going on in our mind in the process. <br />\n<br />\nI&rsquo;d say CP is an intelligent man. He did expose his past but without going into fine details. He stressed his past was to make him realise how good I was and how regretful he felt. <br />\n<br />\nHe said his illness was a karma of what he did. He was touched that I went through this karma with him and he said it&rsquo;s his responsibility to take care of me for rest of my life to repay. I glimpsed my dad and saw some tears in his eyes. This was the only time I saw his tears. <br />\n<br />\nAbout my dad, in fact I was scared of him in this occasion. We kneeled down in front of dad and mom to show respect. I&rsquo;d rather he poured his anger onto us. Instead it was silence, deadly silence. His hands were shaking almost unnoticeably on his laps. He breathed slowly but deeply. His face was stone cold without emotion. Mom tried to say something for me but she was scared too.<br />\n<br />\nHe eventually went upstairs and give him a little red box with a golden ring inside indicating an approval. He didn&rsquo;t say anything. He turned away from us right after and went upstairs, slowly. Kneeling down and watching him go, I felt a bit sad and sorry for him. At that time I knew he loved me and missed me. <br />\n<br />\nAfter married I asked CP, &ldquo;what if dad said no?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you in your home law. By doing so I&rsquo;ve already done what I committed.

She has been a very tough woman despite she&rsquo;s only in her early 60s. She did have a good education in her generation but unfortunately she separated with her husband long time ago. She act as a mother and father. Sometimes I think of CC&rsquo;s mom when I see her. <br />\n<br />\nWe go to visit her once a week. In Thai tradition Daughter-in-law needs to serve husband&rsquo;s mother. Hence when we go to visit her, I usually do some cleaning or help prepare meal.

She keeps saying &ldquo;monmon I have mops wor you don&rsquo;t have to kneel on the floor.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nWe have a good time in cooking. She teaches me a lot of ways to cook Cantonese cuisine. Kitchen is woman&rsquo;s area so CP isn&rsquo;t allowed. She asked me whether CP treated me well because she knew a little bit of CP&rsquo;s past. <br />\n<br />\nWhen i was pregnant, she didn&rsquo;t order me to keep laying in bed but invited me to do something in kitchen if I wanted to. She thought it&rsquo;s good to have something to do. The kitchen is our little world. <br />\n<br />\nCP doesn&rsquo;t talk to her mom a lot. Maybe because they didn&rsquo;t stay together much in CP&rsquo;s childhood. She&rsquo;s been busy working like many parents at that time. But he cares about her very much. Nai Nai said he has been. I was a bit surprised that a man with many colourful sexy stories could take care of his mom too. <br />\n<br />\nI feel like she&rsquo;s my mother in Hong Kong who makes me feel less lonely. In Hong Kong Mother&rsquo;s Day (Thailand&rsquo;s Mother&rsquo;s Day is in a different date) I gave her flowers and said in Cantonese the best as I could, &ldquo;Nai Nai mo chan jit faai lok. ngor oi nei&rdquo; (happy Mother&rsquo;s Day. I love you Nai Nai). She was so happy and said &ldquo; Wah monmon your Cantonese ho jor gum dor! I love you too hahaha&rdquo; and she turned to CP, &ldquo;see what your wife did Ah? Learn something!&rdquo; She&rsquo;s an interesting woman."},{"pid":"b6b6d5906e52749414b88417b6b85e30a994def8","tid":2471979,"uid":396085,"like":16,"dislike":0,"score":16,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-04-11T14:20:11.000Z","msg":"PS: she once mumbled, &ldquo;I hope CP isn&rsquo;t like his dad monmon.&rdquo;  I said he&rsquo;s good to me.

Now it&rsquo;s another round of surge. The business is like other luxury products which people cut their expenses on these things first when they are short of money. In my family&rsquo;s business portfolio the shops mostly target foreigners and middle class Thais. Some of the shops have been closed for months. In Thailand you always have a way to make a living. Like two girls have a leave from clubs and becoming hawkers selling takeaway food: <br />\n<img src=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmTQx3uSDmrYCVLRwDcCJF3LRj5jpA2SCupudEcNDjoPw5?filename=F0QvqLy.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FF0QvqLy.jpg&h=c8c7ff6d&s={SIZE}\" /><img src=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmUUeTZRRHQCZ7CqWncAGEQqXGsD5VtXchs79FSgzXvsZZ?filename=pALy7YU.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FpALy7YU.jpg&h=26d44a7a&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nIronically there are still many girls joining the business given there are so many humble but decent opportunities. &ldquo;Fast and big money&rdquo; is the only reason I can think of. They can earn the money each month that is far beyond imagination if they work as hawker, without mentioning there are always men who &ldquo;sink ship&rdquo; buying expensive things for them. iPhones , watches, purses (of Prada etc), cars... the craziest thing I have heard of is giving her a house. Not a flat, it&rsquo;s a two storey house. <br />\n<br />\nVery touched the girl must be , but be prepared she would not be the only one who would get a house. Even more so, she had to think of a way to go when she gets old. It&rsquo;s sad when one (regardless of sex) has to live under another one&rsquo;s shadow and money. But their values are distorted i would say, they think it&rsquo;s a success like we get a promotion. To secure this promotion they will do something the men want them to like having  a baby without status in the family. Many of these men are very manipulative, I don&rsquo;t know why.
