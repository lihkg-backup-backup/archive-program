It was a torturous month with many sleepless nights. We experienced 6.12, 7.1, 7.14, 7.21, 7.27 and 7.28: dates of darkness. We witnessed more violence, bloodshed, hatred, condemnation, arrests and indictments. What&rsquo;s happening is heart-breaking.<br />\n <br />\nThere are allegations of increased aggression from the protesters. There are allegations of excessive police force. There are allegations of gang collusion. There are allegations of foreign interference. What we see and hear is confusing and conflicting.<br />\n <br />\nHong Kong citizens cherish freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and this combination has cultivated generations of truth-loving people. We must not shy away from the inconvenient truth about what has happened, which has shocked us to the core over the last several weeks.<br />\n <br />\nEvery citizen in Hong Kong wants social stability and harmony. But true stability and harmony only grows in the hearts and minds of the people, and stems from the promise of fairness and justice. True stability cannot last if facts are ignored, distorted or suppressed. Without the truth, there is no right and wrong, and thus no justice.<br />\n <br />\nUniversities are places to pursue truth and virtue. I would therefore like to advocate the setting up of a Truth Commission, which should be made up of unimpeachable personalities that Hong Kong people trust. The purpose of the Truth Commission is to unearth the facts, not to apportion blame. In other words, truth-seeking is not finger-pointing nor pursuing punishment. By establishing the truth, all parties can learn from it, and Hong Kong can rebuild and move forward.<br />\n <br />\nThe world has high hopes for Hong Kong. As citizens, we have high hopes for ourselves, and we hope that our Government can regain respect through bold action and moral authority.<br />\n <br />\nPeople are entitled to the truth.<br />\n <br />\n <br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\n <br />\nRoland T Chin<br />\nPresident<br />\n <br />\n1 August 2019<br />\n<br />\n大家點睇？"},{"pid":"50959543e820d9e215396ce781e6a3b7698a9c91","tid":1393598,"uid":288645,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-01T06:51:22.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/3LEwf6L.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2F3LEwf6L.png&h=589a68a4&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"dd5896110d00159d0882f94cacfbd78bfdea3de2","tid":1393598,"uid":210489,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-01T06:51:34.000Z","msg":"岩岩都睇到<br />\n但唔係好知真相委員會係咩"},{"pid":"b49873f34843bf2807128a0e7f67cee6d189b245","tid":1393598,"uid":105526,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"dd5896110d00159d0882f94cacfbd78bfdea3de2","tid":1393598,"uid":210489,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-01T06:51:34.000Z","msg":"岩岩都睇到<br />\n但唔係好知真相委員會係咩"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-01T06:53:43.000Z","msg":"係咪獨立調查委員會不過查曬黑警同示威者"},{"pid":"a7be28ebe401e1cf12d9f4fb3fa6e49417ea1437","tid":1393598,"uid":108606,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-01T06:54:32.000Z","msg":"真相委員會？ <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n政府控制？？<br />\n<br />\n咁咪即係1984嘅真理部？？？<br />\n<br />\n真理部主要負責根據現實和宣傳需要，改寫歷史文獻，報紙，和文學著作。不過，冠以真理也有深層含義，那就是人為地製造真理。"},{"pid":"480f8b33e106c773e9cb437e1d5fd02c342fc651","tid":1393598,"uid":281059,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-01T06:58:05.000Z","msg":"岩岩都睇到<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d935a7d37e7832f1a6a82d6874a2fab41fc8b184","tid":1393598,"uid":201197,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-01T06:59:14.000Z","msg":"The key question is: What are the power, membership, terms of reference, scope of investigation of this &quot;truth commission&quot;?"},{"pid":"3db71a853bfe33677ac53cde34103ffa9795450b","tid":1393598,"uid":26362,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a7be28ebe401e1cf12d9f4fb3fa6e49417ea1437","tid":1393598,"uid":108606,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-01T06:54:32.000Z","msg":"真相委員會？ <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n政府控制？？<br />\n<br />\n咁咪即係1984嘅真理部？？？<br />\n<br />\n真理部主要負責根據現實和宣傳需要，改寫歷史文獻，報紙，和文學著作。不過，冠以真理也有深層含義，那就是人為地製造真理。"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-01T07:21:19.000Z","msg":"A truth commission or truth and reconciliation commission is a commission tasked with discovering and revealing past wrongdoing by a government (or, depending on the circumstances, non-state actors also), in the hope of resolving conflict left over from the past."}]}
