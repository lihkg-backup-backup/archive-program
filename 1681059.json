Now, I have become the ONLY candidate banned from running in November&rsquo;s District Council Election.<br />\n<br />\n2) The decision to ban me from running office is clearly politically-driven. The so-called 'reasons' is judging subjectively on my intention to uphold Basic Law. But everyone would know that the true reason is my identity, Joshua Wong, is the crime in their mind. Beijing had DEPRIVED me of the right to institutional participation permanently<br />\n<br />\n3) I wish to emphasize that, since the former RO Mrs Dorothy Ma's disappearance in last week, it had become clear that Beijing exerted extremely strong pressure on HK gov't officials who are responsible for deciding my candidacy. Political censorship is an inconvenient truth that even political neutrality is lost.<br />\n<br />\n4) I wish to apologise to my constituents if I have failed their expectation &mdash; to serve the residents as a councillor. But hereby I also affirm that, I still believe that democracy begins from the ground. In the future, I'm not giving up community advocacy just because Beijing doesn't like me to do so.<br />\n<br />\n5) I'm grateful to my teammate, Kelvin Lam, who bravely takes up this daunting task at this very moment, to run for office. I appeal to all voters in my district, to support Kelvin in this election.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E9%81%B8%E8%88%89%E4%B8%BB%E4%BB%BB%E8%AE%80%E5%BF%83%E8%A1%93%E1%85%A0%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E7%A1%AC%E5%91%BD%E4%BB%A4-%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%88%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%83%E9%81%B8%E8%B3%87%E6%A0%BC/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthestandnews.com%2Fpolitics%2F%25E9%2581%25B8%25E8%2588%2589%25E4%25B8%25BB%25E4%25BB%25BB%25E8%25AE%2580%25E5%25BF%2583%25E8%25A1%2593%25E1%2585%25A0%25E5%258C%2597%25E4%25BA%25AC%25E6%2594%25BF%25E5%25BA%259C%25E7%25A1%25AC%25E5%2591%25BD%25E4%25BB%25A4-%25E5%259B%259E%25E6%2587%2589%25E6%2594%25BF%25E5%25BA%259C%25E5%258F%2596%25E6%25B6%2588%25E6%2588%2591%25E7%259A%2584%25E5%258F%2583%25E9%2581%25B8%25E8%25B3%2587%25E6%25A0%25BC%2F&d=WC8zRIkQRph3x4hQUB%2Bsg5rbLZzzsfwfKyNyJagnZM4%3D&h=a8ce0883\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthestandnews.com%2Fpolitics%2F%25E9%2581%25B8%25E8%2588%2589%25E4%25B8%25BB%25E4%25BB%25BB%25E8%25AE%2580%25E5%25BF%2583%25E8%25A1%2593%25E1%2585%25A0%25E5%258C%2597%25E4%25BA%25AC%25E6%2594%25BF%25E5%25BA%259C%25E7%25A1%25AC%25E5%2591%25BD%25E4%25BB%25A4-%25E5%259B%259E%25E6%2587%2589%25E6%2594%25BF%25E5%25BA%259C%25E5%258F%2596%25E6%25B6%2588%25E6%2588%2591%25E7%259A%2584%25E5%258F%2583%25E9%2581%25B8%25E8%25B3%2587%25E6%25A0%25BC%2F&h=ceae0b72\" target=\"_blank\">https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E9%81%B8%E8%88%89%E4%B8%BB%E4%BB%BB%E8%AE%80%E5%BF%83%E8%A1%93%E1%85%A0%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E7%A1%AC%E5%91%BD%E4%BB%A4-%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%88%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%83%E9%81%B8%E8%B3%87%E6%A0%BC/</a>"},{"pid":"e55cc01019bb57b61d56093f066b6fbd6a5a68da","tid":1681059,"uid":47605,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-29T07:35:16.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><img src=\"https://na.cx/i/T7kDwBC.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FT7kDwBC.jpg&h=6da1c92c&s={SIZE}\" /><img src=\"https://na.cx/i/Mtm3RDU.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FMtm3RDU.jpg&h=fd9c9c47&s={SIZE}\" /></blockquote>"},{"pid":"4762e51094a131a64fe797328516ce738f6353c3","tid":1681059,"uid":195252,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-29T08:11:27.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"222483ee322a5aa0134df80a7c1d8f3a4fcae95c","tid":1681059,"uid":315502,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-29T08:14:46.000Z","msg":"push"}]}
