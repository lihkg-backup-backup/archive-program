Mr Le Maire&nbsp;told France Inter&nbsp;on Monday that he was &ldquo;shocked&rdquo; by Twitter&rsquo;s move. He added: &ldquo;<strong><span class=\"red\">Digital regulation should not be done by the digital oligarchy itself&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;Regulation of the digital arena is a matter for the sovereign people, governments and the judiciary</span></strong>.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe ban has also come under attack from Alexei Navalny, the prominent Russian blogger and dissident. He called it &ldquo;<strong><span class=\"red\">an unacceptable act of censorship</span></strong>&rdquo; that would be used by the Kremlin to justify his own blacklisting by state media.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The ban on Twitter is a decision of people we don&rsquo;t know in accordance with a procedure we don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said in a Twitter message, <strong><span class=\"red\">adding that the decision was &ldquo;based on emotions and personal political preferences&rdquo;.</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;This precedent will be exploited by the enemies of freedom of speech around the world,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;In Russia as well. Every time when they need to silence someone, they will say: &lsquo;this is just common practice, even Trump got blocked on Twitter.&rsquo;&rdquo;"},{"pid":"ba6673584d7c34cab34d4d723fed8a65295f2fbe","tid":2362858,"uid":21699,"like":10,"dislike":0,"score":10,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-01-11T18:05:50.000Z","msg":"你慢左，第一個post已經成千個正評，而家你先叫人估<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d068dbbe41569ae19f9e109d336debb6583a676e","tid":2362858,"uid":295230,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"quote":{"pid":"ba6673584d7c34cab34d4d723fed8a65295f2fbe","tid":2362858,"uid":21699,"like":10,"dislike":0,"score":10,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-01-11T18:05:50.000Z","msg":"你慢左，第一個post已經成千個正評，而家你先叫人估<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-11T18:06:40.000Z","msg":"訓着左岩岩醒<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/23.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5eee85023de43f996fbd9ff3e62030e6ab437feb","tid":2362858,"uid":36383,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-01-11T18:13:02.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/pray.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 修有物理學碩士及量子化學博士專業"},{"pid":"939ff56d7b9ce83ef321ba50e106051f216df1ae","tid":2362858,"uid":47674,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-11T18:13:10.000Z","msg":"連登仔<br />\n2020: <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />彭斯     <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/bark.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />默克爾<br />\n2021: <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/run.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />默克爾    <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/bark.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />彭斯"},{"pid":"2a696e106300557d8ab842536097b9ca864c5a28","tid":2362858,"uid":295230,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"5eee85023de43f996fbd9ff3e62030e6ab437feb","tid":2362858,"uid":36383,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-01-11T18:13:02.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/pray.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 修有物理學碩士及量子化學博士專業"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-11T18:14:22.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/pray.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />但無環境保育學位"},{"pid":"78151f17e4bd9d30f6ae275f2868853a93210e5c","tid":2362858,"uid":256837,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-11T18:23:32.000Z","msg":"歐盟不嬲唔鍾意西岸科企壟斷<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"444d863084590a77cd14e054102e22efb28b8b44","tid":2362858,"uid":251732,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-11T19:02:29.000Z","msg":"Deutschland, Deutschland &uuml;ber alles<img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/love.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/love.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"02c4cff0db6bd857a2d0f69fcb1f635829e80ce5","tid":2362858,"uid":176447,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-11T19:16:27.000Z","msg":"一來歐洲(德國) 人偏好中小企主導經濟<br />\n二來faang冇一間係歐洲嘢 歐洲網絡科技公司有名同影響力寥寥可數<br />\n咁咪大大聲屌<br />\n又可以搞gdpr 2.0<img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/potion.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
