He said it was difficult to think that they were now political criminals.<br />\n<br />\nThe pair were among several student and civic groups which occupied Taiwan&rsquo;s Legislative Yuan in March 2014 over a trade pact with China. Over 400 people were investigated.<br />\n<br />\n&lsquo;Deterrent effect&rsquo;<br />\n<br />\nIn Hong Kong, lawmaker Paul Tse told RTHK on Wednesday that the ruling by the appeal court had a deterrent effect and can serve as a guide for society. Giving an example, he said that methamphetamine was previously only seen as a social drug, but subsequent rulings elevated it to the ranks of drugs such as cocaine.<br />\n<br />\nThe protests in 2014 were in response to Finance Committee chair Ng Leung-sing forcing a vote on a  HK$340 million funding proposal for a controversial northeast New Territories development plan. The vote took place whilst pan-democrats were out of their seats."},{"pid":"56fc49caa0a8c4e3cba24713a3d27fe577c77968","tid":363689,"uid":47714,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-17T21:10:02.000Z","msg":"網頁內有記者會o既片"},{"pid":"eaff22e6dd11b04bc321372fcd3efe0545bab9f1","tid":363689,"uid":130247,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-17T21:15:02.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"339d340c8729ed524304a1d952777fbe5e309b87","tid":363689,"uid":23170,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-17T22:31:53.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"2947c92ab6246ebd75015bb18a0c92b95851cbaf","tid":363689,"uid":37528,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-18T00:09:00.000Z","msg":"台灣<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"34a2f69e0a9d9d9a4a1258e371d1c3c0d0e2b319","tid":363689,"uid":35790,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-18T00:12:40.000Z","msg":"美考慮檢討香港政策法<br />\n台灣會唔會修改港澳條例？"},{"pid":"e5659a1b1ea2cc5c4385d2d150e58586faef6aea","tid":363689,"uid":22858,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-18T00:13:36.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c8a5886fa860be3802d48fafb97e519a33e6bdaf","tid":363689,"uid":44358,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-18T00:41:56.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>美考慮檢討香港政策法<br />\n台灣會唔會修改港澳條例？</blockquote><br />\n<br />\n呢樣又好似冇乜用<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n只有香港政策法先有大殺傷力<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
