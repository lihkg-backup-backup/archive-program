Officers blocked an ambulance from reaching Chow, the posts alleged, delaying aid that could have saved his life.<br />\n<br />\nNevermind that the claims were unsubstantiated, that police denied chasing Chow and that mainstream news outlets, including the South China Morning Post, described the circumstances of his fall as unclear. Hundreds of protesters seized on his Nov. 8 death to engage in clashes with police that resulted in one person being shot on Monday.<br />\n<br />\nTwo Hong Kong Protesters Shot by Police in Morning Commute Chaos<br />\nRiot police fire tear gas in an attempt to disperse demonstrators during a protest in Sai Wan Ho on Nov. 11.<br />\n<br />\nAs Hong Kong&rsquo;s anti-government protests stretch into their 23rd straight week, the city is being inundated with online rumors, fake news and propaganda from both sides of the political divide. The polarizing rhetoric is fueling distrust and violence, making it harder to resolve the crisis that has plunged Hong Kong into a recession and raised doubts about the city&rsquo;s role as Asia&rsquo;s premier financial hub.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;False information feeds itself to polarize public opinion,&rdquo; said Masato Kajimoto, an assistant professor at Hong Kong University&rsquo;s Journalism and Media Studies Centre, who has spent the last seven years studying fake news. &ldquo;I worry that it reaches a point where reconciliation of this divide is no longer possible.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nRead the latest on Hong Kong&rsquo;s protests here<br />\n<br />\nWhile the spread of disinformation has become a growing concern around the world, few places have been as affected in recent weeks as Hong Kong. In the past 24 hours alone, local authorities have denied rumors that they ordered police to fire on protesters at will; planned to cap cash withdrawals from banks; and would use emergency powers to shut financial markets and schools. After one of the most violent days since protests started in June, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam urged citizens to &ldquo;stay calm and see the facts.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nTelegram posts 3<br />\nPosters circulating on Telegram on Chow&rsquo;s death.<br />\nThe city&rsquo;s protests began with largely peaceful demonstrations against the Chinese government&rsquo;s growing encroachment on Hong Kong&rsquo;s freedoms. But as factions of the movement have grown more extreme, so too have the narratives spread by both sides.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWhile protest supporters often demonize the police and the government, pro-establishment camps tend to push narratives describing demonstrators as angry rioters, terrorists and &ldquo;cockroaches&rdquo; intent on destabilizing the city and doing the bidding of foreign agents.<br />\n<br />\nThe proliferation of questionable information has coincided with waning confidence in once-trusted Hong Kong institutions. Nearly 80% of the public is dissatisfied with the government&rsquo;s performance, up from 40% a year ago, according to the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute.

Several demonstrators responded by showing up at her school to smash glass doors and spread graffiti on the walls.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;In more peaceful times maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t believe those claims that the police or government agents murdered her and are covering up the evidence,&rdquo; said Ko, a first year law student at the University of Hong Kong who declined to give his last name, as he handed out protest fliers beside a shrine for Chan. &ldquo;People are scared and don&rsquo;t trust the authorities anymore.

Hundreds of social media accounts linked to a Chinese government-backed information operation to undermine the protest movement were removed in August, according to Twitter Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.&rsquo;s YouTube, which deleted the accounts. New accounts have since appeared pushing the same kinds of narratives, according to research from Astroscreen, a startup that monitors social media manipulation.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPro-government posts often spread photos, memes and videos propagating unsubstantiated rumors of U.S. black hands funding the demonstrations and young female protesters acting as so-called comfort women for male counterparts. Their messages are sometimes amplified by Chinese state media and nationalistic netizen networks known as &ldquo;fangirls.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nAnti-government protesters have used similar tactics as they seek to influence global perceptions of the movement.

Similar tasks have targeted the National Basketball Association and basketball star Lebron James. Blizzard, the NBA and James didn&rsquo;t respond to requests for comment.<br />\n<br />\nOf course, many posts in support of the protest movement and against the city&rsquo;s authorities are authentic. But there&rsquo;s evidence that some have gone beyond digital activism and into the realm of misinformation, which researchers define as erroneous posts spread unintentionally. That differs from disinformation, which is false content spread with the specific intent to deceive, mislead or manipulate.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, a protest supporter last month posted a misleading image depicting Chief Executive Lam using her mobile device during the enthronement of the Japanese Emperor, a sign of disrespect. Within hours, the post was shared thousands of times, including by prominent activist Agnes Chow and local news outlet Apple Daily. It turned out the image was actually taken before the event started, according to a report from Annie Lab, a fact-checking project at HKU&rsquo;s Journalism and Media Studies Centre.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIn another instance of the protests expanding beyond their initial scope, a demonstration is planned on Monday, essentially against a police crackdown on protesters&rsquo; finances.<br />\n<br />\nThe protest is in support of the Spark Alliance, a shadowy group that has raised money to help support the demonstrators. Last week, the police arrested four people connected with the alliance for suspected money laundering.<br />\n<br />\nThe authorities froze HK$70 million ($9 million) of bank deposits and personal

the edge of a parking garage in Hong Kong, the allegations began spreading online.<br />\n<br />\nPosts circulating in chat groups and on social media claimed the 22-year-old student was chased -- and maybe even pushed -- by police who were clearing protesters with tear gas nearby. Officers blocked an ambulance from reaching Chow, the posts alleged, delaying aid that could have saved his life.<br />\n<br />\nNevermind that the claims were unsubstantiated, that police denied chasing Chow and that mainstream news outlets, including the South China Morning Post, described the circumstances of his fall as unclear. Hundreds of protesters seized on his Nov. 8 death to engage in clashes with police that resulted in one person being shot on Monday.<br />\n<br />\nTwo Hong Kong Protesters Shot by Police in Morning Commute Chaos<br />\nRiot police fire tear gas in an attempt to disperse demonstrators during a protest in Sai Wan Ho on Nov. 11.<br />\n<br />\nAs Hong Kong&rsquo;s anti-government protests stretch into their 23rd straight week, the city is being inundated with online rumors, fake news and propaganda from both sides of the political divide. The polarizing rhetoric is fueling distrust and violence, making it harder to resolve the crisis that has plunged Hong Kong into a recession and raised doubts about the city&rsquo;s role as Asia&rsquo;s premier financial hub.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;False information feeds itself to polarize public opinion,&rdquo; said Masato Kajimoto, an assistant professor at Hong Kong University&rsquo;s Journalism and Media Studies Centre, who has spent the last seven years studying fake news. &ldquo;I worry that it reaches a point where reconciliation of this divide is no longer possible.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nRead the latest on Hong Kong&rsquo;s protests here<br />\n<br />\nWhile the spread of disinformation has become a growing concern around the world, few places have been as affected in recent weeks as Hong Kong. In the past 24 hours alone, local authorities have denied rumors that they ordered police to fire on protesters at will; planned to cap cash withdrawals from banks; and would use emergency powers to shut financial markets and schools. After one of the most violent days since protests started in June, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam urged citizens to &ldquo;stay calm and see the facts.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nTelegram posts 3<br />\nPosters circulating on Telegram on Chow&rsquo;s death.<br />\nThe city&rsquo;s protests began with largely peaceful demonstrations against the Chinese government&rsquo;s growing encroachment on Hong Kong&rsquo;s freedoms. But as factions of the movement have grown more extreme, so too have the narratives spread by both sides.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWhile protest supporters often demonize the police and the government, pro-establishment camps tend to push narratives describing demonstrators as angry rioters, terrorists and &ldquo;cockroaches&rdquo; intent on destabilizing the city and doing the bidding of foreign agents.<br />\n<br />\nThe proliferation of questionable information has coincided with waning confidence in once-trusted Hong Kong institutions. Nearly 80% of the public is dissatisfied with the government&rsquo;s performance, up from 40% a year ago, according to the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute. Just over a tenth of the city supports Lam, and only half the population is satisfied with the police force.<br />\n<br />\nSinking Support<br />\nOpinion polls show Carrie Lam is Hong Kong's least
