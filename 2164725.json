On the other hand, people aged 75 and over have a death rate 80 times that. For people under 18 years old, the rate of death is zero per 100,000. <br />\n<br />\nOf all fatal cases in New York state, two-thirds were in patients over 70 years of age; more than 95 percent were over 50 years of age; and about 90 percent of all fatal cases had an underlying illness. Of 6,570 confirmed COVID-19 deaths fully investigated for underlying conditions to date, 6,520, or 99.2 percent, had an underlying illness. If you do not already have an underlying chronic condition, your chances of dying are small, regardless of age. And young adults and children in normal health have almost no risk of any serious illness from COVID-19.<br />\n<br />\nFact 2: Protecting older, at-risk people eliminates hospital overcrowding.<br />\n<br />\nWe can learn about hospital utilization from data from New York City, the hotbed of COVID-19 with more than 34,600 hospitalizations to date. For those under 18 years of age, hospitalization from the virus is 0.01 percent, or 11 per 100,000 people; for those 18 to 44 years old, hospitalization is 0.1 percent. Even for people ages 65 to 74, only 1.7 percent were hospitalized. Of 4,103 confirmed COVID-19 patients with symptoms bad enough to seek medical care, Dr. Leora Horwitz of NYU Medical Center concluded &quot;age is far and away the strongest risk factor for hospitalization.&quot; Even early WHO reports noted that 80 percent of all cases were mild, and more recent studies show a far more widespread rate of infection and lower rate of serious illness. Half of all people testing positive for infection have no symptoms at all. The vast majority of younger, otherwise healthy people do not need significant medical care if they catch this infection.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/494034-the-data-are-in-stop-the-panic-and-end-the-total-isolation\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fopinion%2Fhealthcare%2F494034-the-data-are-in-stop-the-panic-and-end-the-total-isolation&d=MYvC0VRZm9a3oqKPvUvInCWBa%2BgBXVTVyFCVgu0cTpM%3D&h=45e95ec4\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/494034-the-data-are-in-stop-the-panic-and-end-the-total-isolation</a>"},{"pid":"d7885bc204b084e0ecfd7476c94a6ec616bbb14c","tid":2164725,"uid":86756,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-19T15:58:40.000Z","msg":"結論呢"},{"pid":"bb51b6f2e03888df1b1d2c9ba700605e909927bf","tid":2164725,"uid":251026,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"d7885bc204b084e0ecfd7476c94a6ec616bbb14c","tid":2164725,"uid":86756,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-19T15:58:40.000Z","msg":"結論呢"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-19T17:16:20.000Z","msg":"At long last, and maybe too late, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a statement on &ldquo;The Importance of Reopening Americans Schools this Fall.&rdquo; After issuing warnings about potential risks to children all spring and early summer, the CDC acknowledged what has been known throughout the world for months &mdash; that &ldquo;COVID-19 poses relatively low risks to school aged children. &hellip; So far in this pandemic, deaths of children are less than in each of the last five flu seasons.&rdquo;   <br />\n<br />\nThat couples with the CDC&rsquo;s observation that &ldquo;for children (0-17 years), cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rates are lower than cumulative influenza hospitalization rates during recent influenza seasons.&rdquo; Moreover, &ldquo;the rate of infection &hellip; from students to teachers has been low.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/509699-fear-first-education-last\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fopinion%2Fhealthcare%2F509699-fear-first-education-last&d=MYvC0VRZm9a3oqKPvUvInCWBa%2BgBXVTVyFCVgu0cTpM%3D&h=095e7aec\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/509699-fear-first-education-last</a><br />\n<br />\n對18歲以下人士，Covid19殺傷力比流感弱好多<br />\n結論，美國唔須要停課停學<br />\n<br />\n香港一樣無須要停學"},{"pid":"75d0e376507460fc6f0a0e78844cca0bedcc0bcb","tid":2164725,"uid":251026,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-19T17:18:50.000Z","msg":"Tucker: Lockdowns are destroying America<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhAB97esb6w\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQhAB97esb6w&d=MYvC0VRZm9a3oqKPvUvInCWBa%2BgBXVTVyFCVgu0cTpM%3D&h=f86fde17\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhAB97esb6w</a><br />\n<br />\nCovid19係一場摧毀西方文明嘅陰謀 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"00ed6d4da01b4fc2bdc90a5500cf80fbd180c159","tid":2164725,"uid":259581,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-20T08:47:17.000Z","msg":"👍"},{"pid":"917dce048371c7bdefad16cc9f3b6cb248b7b09d","tid":2164725,"uid":147629,"like":3,"dislike":1,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-20T08:49:45.000Z","msg":"對18歲以下人士，Covid19殺傷力比流感弱好多<br />\n結論，美國唔須要停課停學<br />\n<br />\n香港一樣無須要停學<br />\n<br />\n結論會唔會太武斷？結論只係學生感染會無事，但佢哋一樣會傳染畀其他人，而其他人唔係個個十八歲以下"},{"pid":"0a40d1cf5b95924770afe6fedfe55308eaea327a","tid":2164725,"uid":236878,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-20T09:17:47.000Z","msg":"On撚9 唔計後遺症 對個肺的影響 剩係計死亡率<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6e683871a48b25a19d169f7acff08b6f3d966181","tid":2164725,"uid":251026,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-20T09:35:48.000Z","msg":"你哋比香港嘅建制，同Tedros呢個共產黨員呃咗<br />\n<br />\n係歐美有大規模反lockdown遊行示威，因為covid19嘅殺傷力的確flu差唔多，但係lockdown嘅影響就過大<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/education/500349-science-says-open-the-schools\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fopinion%2Feducation%2F500349-science-says-open-the-schools&d=MYvC0VRZm9a3oqKPvUvInCWBa%2BgBXVTVyFCVgu0cTpM%3D&h=0ff168cd\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://thehill.com/opinion/education/500349-science-says-open-the-schools</a><br />\n<br />\nIn addition, children are being denied opportunities for social and emotional development that come with play, exercise, sports and socialization. Reports already indicate that suicide rates among the young are on the increase. More certain is the loss in human capital that lasts a lifetime: Closing schools this past spring translates into a 3 percent or more cut in lifetime earnings for those whose education is being sidelined. Clearly, closing schools does not benefit those whom schools are supposed to serve. <br />\n<br />\nBut what about the adults &mdash; the teachers, guidance counsellors, bus drivers and kitchen staff? No one wants to endanger the health of educators but, fortunately, risks to adults in schools are much less than those encountered in grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential businesses. A<ins>s is shown across the world, including Switzerland, Canada, the Netherlands, France, Iceland, the UK, Australia and now Ireland, children seldom if ever transmit the disease to adults, even to their parents. </ins>Several epidemiologists recently denounced the widely cited April publication that erroneously concluded that children can transmit COVID-19 just as readily as adults. Its author, German virologist Christian Drosten, previously had been featured as a COVID-19 hero, abetting the panic to close schools.<br />\n<br />\nNo less important, COVID-19 mainly targets the elderly and those with underlying conditions. <ins>For people under 60, COVID-19 fatality rates are so low that they are less than or equal to those associated with the seasonal flu, according to data from France, Spain and the Netherlands, as well as the CDC. </ins>Certainly, adults at high risk or who are fearful should take precautions, and by now they understand how to social-distance for their own protection. But teaching is a young person&rsquo;s occupation. Teachers&rsquo; median age is 41; more than 80 percent are under the age of 55, the age at which most become eligible for a retirement pension."},{"pid":"4aada52ca7250898ec9bccc4b536948347596b68","tid":2164725,"uid":251026,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"quote":{"pid":"0a40d1cf5b95924770afe6fedfe55308eaea327a","tid":2164725,"uid":236878,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-20T09:17:47.000Z","msg":"On撚9 唔計後遺症 對個肺的影響 剩係計死亡率<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-20T09:54:36.000Z","msg":"How many people with the coronavirus disease are asymptomatic?<br />\n<br />\nFor COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation.2020年3月6日<br />\n<br />\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report<br />\n8成人連症狀都無，醫院都唔駛住<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yeah.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\nIn children, despite exceptionally rare cases, COVID-19 is not a significant risk &mdash; even compared to influenza.
