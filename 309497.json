The monsters<br />\n<br />\n... To keep their player audience content and interested, new monsters with unique skills are frequently being introduced &hellip; they give players a prior notice before release to capture and maintain the interest of their players and give them a chance to save on magic stones (premium currency) to summon them.<br />\n<br />\n&hellip; the main difference between success and failure of the game relies on pleasing the players, and this can be easily observed by how easy and frequent it is to obtain the premium currency (magic stones). From my experienced with PAD, I noticed that GungHo is very generous with their magic stones. <br />\n<br />\n2. The gameplay<br />\n<br />\n&hellip; the idea is simple yet challenging. Popular games like Candy Crush utilize this puzzle feature to match combos based on the given parameters and objective of the level&hellip;<br />\n... This time limit can be adjusted depending on the monsters you have; some monsters are able to extend the match time which give the player more time to match combos. However, matching orbs are not as common as moving an orb up, down, left, and right; the player has full control of the board.... This creates a whole new sense of strategy as players are given an infinite period of time to think about how they want to progress through the dungeon. Basically, players can exit the app, browse another app, stare at the screen for hours (would not recommend), and the dungeon monsters will still be waiting for the player to make the first move.<br />\n<br />\n3. The RNG Summons<br />\n<br />\n&hellip; PAD will consistently give players magic stones through events and challenges so as various monster pools are rotated in and out, players can summon at a frequent rate so it doesn&rsquo;t feel that PAD is a pay-to-win (P2W) game... About the summoning feature of the game, it is common that the summoning events feature awesome monsters but the player doesn&rsquo;t get what they want. It is obvious that the rates to pull an epic monster are quite low, but this gives the sense of gambling while not hurting your wallet. Due to the nature of the game, there are a lot of monsters in these summoning events that generally help the player in one way rather than hinder progress &hellip; summoning copies of one monster can be a pretty good thing."},{"pid":"309938acbe6a19420ebfd79e1860b4ff86340866","tid":309497,"uid":46373,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-05T05:50:23.000Z","msg":"垃圾game"},{"pid":"6183852279f72f02df9c058edd0dee8bdf983036","tid":309497,"uid":33721,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-05T05:52:09.000Z","msg":"版權先係大問題 出名實貴  唔出名買黎都晒氣<br />\n<br />\n一係就好似其他GAME咁畫D角色 神出黎<br />\n<br />\n但又無左佢一開始個賣點"},{"pid":"fe5144f48e1528b6d89ab11112982fafd57a81b6","tid":309497,"uid":4880,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-05T05:55:02.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>版權先係大問題 出名實貴  唔出名買黎都晒氣<br />\n<br />\n一係就好似其他GAME咁畫D角色 神出黎<br />\n<br />\n但又無左佢一開始個賣點</blockquote><br />\n佢成個記招俾我的感覺只係想整個platform 出黎sell其他人D野<br />\n所以你話&quot;出名實貴  唔出名買黎都晒氣&quot; 我係好同意"},{"pid":"ef49d25d9813c87e9c0c081ccb06ea47029e3953","tid":309497,"uid":4880,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-05T06:01:56.000Z","msg":"同埋有冇人同我一樣, 每當個CM講完野, 就好想扭甩佢個頭?"},{"pid":"d95ccfb8a5aeaf5450c5cd35ea50e56ce7b3eddd","tid":309497,"uid":4880,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-05T06:12:44.000Z","msg":"[1] puzzles and dragons<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://forum.us.monster-strike.com/discussion/2896/why-is-puzzle-dragons-more-popular-in-the-usa-than-monster-strike\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.us.monster-strike.com%2Fdiscussion%2F2896%2Fwhy-is-puzzle-dragons-more-popular-in-the-usa-than-monster-strike&d=%2F%2FQmoH%2FgMcs2fxRgan34XgKEmdudW1rq3V1Y15kzxIU%3D&h=0c4668da\" target=\"_blank\">http://forum.us.monster-strike.com/discussion/2896/why-is-puzzle-dragons-more-popular-in-the-usa-than-monster-strike</a><br />\n<br />\nMS = Monster Strike, 怪物彈珠<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;&hellip; PAD came to the US market first&hellip; &ldquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;&hellip; the continuous advertisements PAD cycles through virtually every conceivable avenue&hellip;. the idea of advertising a product usually works best when potential consumers know how the product works&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;&hellip; because PAD is popular and gets up-voted so it remains popular.

Also the other most important sales point of a mobile game is that it is extremely social focus (social media).<br />\n<br />\n&hellip;They did something that removed a core aspect of what made MS a social mobile game. By removing the social media coop, the community was basically torn apart with a lot of people being unable to play with each other. The only ones who could were those who would meet up in person, or through incorrect methods. I don't know how damaging this was to the MS community overall, but I do recall that the MS Facebook page never got any bigger after that happened...&rdquo;"},{"pid":"e3124f2f12c2e694ee97155b26e02ee90ed3f9d4","tid":309497,"uid":4880,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-05T06:27:55.000Z","msg":"[1] puzzles and dragons<br />\n<br />\n所以綜合部份玩家ge意見，一隻成功ge apps要具備以下的元素<br />\n<br />\n1. 內容要獨特，不定時更新黎保鮮<br />\n2. 容易上手<br />\n3. 定時獎勵玩家<br />\n4. 廣告，但前題係potential consumers know how the product works<br />\n5. non-competitive<br />\n6. 強大的game community (即係有話題)<br />\n<br />\n當然呢D只係部份玩家的感覺，實際上個extent影響到幾大就真係唔知。"},{"pid":"13658c9c47e22411a8900d7d78257feda17124eb","tid":309497,"uid":4880,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-05T07:06:28.000Z","msg":"[2] Pok&eacute;mon Go <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Pok%C3%A9mon-GO-so-popular\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhy-is-Pok%25C3%25A9mon-GO-so-popular&d=%2F%2FQmoH%2FgMcs2fxRgan34XgKEmdudW1rq3V1Y15kzxIU%3D&h=bdbbc52f\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Pok%C3%A9mon-GO-so-popular</a><br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;...Riley Patterson rightly points out that Go&rsquo;s availability at zero cost on phones that people already own (as opposed to a $40 game for a console fewer people own) is important to its success; I view cost as a necessary, but not sufficient condition for Go&rsquo;s huge success.<br />\n<br />\nThe most striking thing about the Pok&eacute;mon universe is how pervasive Pok&eacute;mon are in everyone&rsquo;s daily lives...
