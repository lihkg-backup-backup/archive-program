On October 1st, the police recklessly fired two live bullets at a student&rsquo;s chest, resulting in pulmonary hemorrhage. The student is only 17 years old, as was willing to put his life on the line if it meant a free, democratic Hong Kong. Therefore, we hope that students, teachers, and students alike can go to Festival Walk on Friday (4/10) at 6:00pm to reiterate our demands and support our fellow protestors. <br />\n<br />\nThe war has no been won."},{"pid":"2fa5ceb8907f668047663e3368f081e293901b47","tid":1615905,"uid":322203,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T08:42:38.000Z","msg":"The war has <strong><span style=\"color: red;\">NOT</span></strong> been won<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
