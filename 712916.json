He added that the dossier would involve a &ldquo;census of Roma in Italy&rdquo; which would &ldquo;see who, how, how many&rdquo;. He added: &ldquo;Unfortunately, you need to keep Italian Roma in Italy.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe country is estimated to be home to between 100,000 and 180,000 Roma.<br />\n<br />\nOn Wednesday, Mr Salvini met with&nbsp;Austrian populist leaders&nbsp;in Rome, where they pledged to increase&nbsp;protection of Europe&rsquo;s southern border from immigration.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;It is a historic moment because Europe has never had the possibility to change like in these days. We think it can change for the better on the topics of immigration, security and the fight against terrorism. Finally there is a decision to protect the exterior border,&rdquo; he&nbsp;said.<br />\n<br />\nMr Salvini&rsquo;s move against the Roma community drew condemnation from rights groups and opposition politicians.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The way is short from a census to a concentration camp. Salvini apparently decided to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the racial laws,&rdquo; Chiara Gribaudo, a deputy from the centre-left Democratic Party said, referencing the Mussolini era.<br />\n<br />\nCarlo&nbsp;Stasolla, president of&nbsp;Associazione&nbsp;21&nbsp;Luglio, a group that campaigns for Roma rights, said: &ldquo;The interior minister does not seem to know that a census on the basis of ethnicity is not permitted by law.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/italy-matteo-salvini-video-immigration-mass-cleansing-roma-travellers-far-right-league-party-a8409506.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fitaly-matteo-salvini-video-immigration-mass-cleansing-roma-travellers-far-right-league-party-a8409506.html&d=KS0vpi2ktMzGLpXaLEoyBPjR1yQ20Y%2BboumAcDwsk0E%3D&h=a80a20f8\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/italy-matteo-salvini-video-immigration-mass-cleansing-roma-travellers-far-right-league-party-a8409506.html</a>"},{"pid":"4b849b97f1373f46310ce5eb83f5c27802cc3a1d","tid":712916,"uid":131691,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-22T14:04:00.000Z","msg":"Right Wing Death Squads <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bomb.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bomb.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bomb.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
