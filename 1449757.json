for investigation and prosecution of the HONG KONG POLICE FORCE<br />\n<br />\nDear Sir/ Madam,<br />\n<br />\nOver the past months in Hong Kong, dozens of demonstrations were held in protest of the amendments proposed to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, also known as the Extradition bill, by the government.<br />\nHowever, the government has refused to back down, directing the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) to employ increasingly brutal and excessive violence to disperse and arrest not only protesters, but also innocent bystanders. <br />\nAs witnessed by multiple media outlets around the globe, the HKPF has chosen to deploy its use of &ldquo;less-lethal&rdquo; weaponry in manners clearly violating guidelines, aiming their gas canisters and sponge bullets directly towards the heads of reporters, protesters and bystanders alike &ndash; leading to multiple injuries, including partial and total loss of vision in some cases.<br />\nMoreover, as identified and verified by multiple outlets, the tear gas used by the HKPF was also well past its use by date, and may cause serious, or even lethal damage to the inhalants&rsquo; health, as the chemicals used may degrade into phosgene and cyanide. The HKPF has refused to answer to multiple enquiries by the press on this matter, and has even resorted to removing the expiry date on the gas canisters fired.<br />\nMeanwhile, despite pleads from different parties across the societal spectrum, the Hong Kong SAR government has refused to form an independent investigation committee regarding the current political turmoil, and the suspected wrongdoings of its force. <br />\nIn light of such events, I humbly plead for your assistance, to launch an investigation on the unlawful and extreme violence demonstrated by the HKPF, and to, by whatever means necessary, condemn the wrongdoings of the HKPF, should any be found.<br />\nThank you for your kind attention. I sincerely wish that, your renowned and impartial status, along with connections to the UN, may bring much needed attention, and stop future misdeeds from the HKPF. <br />\n<br />\nRegards, <br />\nXXXX<br />\nA desperate Hong Kong citizen<br />\n<br />\nanother template"}]}
