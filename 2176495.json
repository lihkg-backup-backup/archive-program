It appears we have been targeted under the climate of the new security law and because of our impartial, fact-based coverage.&rdquo;//<br />\n<br />\n//In an emailed response to HKFP on Tuesday, a spokesperson for Immigration did not state why the visa was denied: &ldquo;Hong Kong has always adopted a pragmatic and open policy on the employment of professionals in Hong Kong, allowing those possessing special skills, knowledge or experience of value to and not readily available in Hong Kong to apply to come to work, including journalistic work,&rdquo; they said. They added that each case was processed in accordance with the law.//"},{"pid":"acdaf3672c089d3129de31360b87d735af998253","tid":2176495,"uid":263944,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-27T06:33:57.000Z","msg":"PUSH"},{"pid":"60f29d3036ad9312bda072aa8456d733139d68c9","tid":2176495,"uid":77196,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-27T06:35:17.000Z","msg":"極權國家一直唔需要理由..."},{"pid":"c9c2738de068274cd2cbb9387b434c0dadccdce1","tid":2176495,"uid":263944,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-27T06:35:33.000Z","msg":"PUSH"},{"pid":"1f9249dc326efe16e42378a0b2d737d781b39692","tid":2176495,"uid":263944,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-27T06:35:46.000Z","msg":"PUSH"},{"pid":"24e99e2953f2d36e69ef48305160aa2aaa843d98","tid":2176495,"uid":263944,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-27T06:35:56.000Z","msg":"PUSH"},{"pid":"88e84baa38f1bc3abeb79a98fc8b3385f301c852","tid":2176495,"uid":138964,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-27T06:37:08.000Z","msg":"第三世界<br />\n極權國家<br />\n軍政府<br />\n又一力證向國際表明<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"147c8df851f4009a369751e0fe061166f9c3bf55","tid":2176495,"uid":232594,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-27T06:39:55.000Z","msg":"解釋：香港已經冇新聞自由"},{"pid":"4767a49c2781c477fa54fab67cf42b374aad7938","tid":2176495,"uid":75877,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-27T06:52:00.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"e04f80459d0d377d9e367e066b75f0fbef0a099f","tid":2176495,"uid":369741,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-27T07:54:39.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/9gq4gUv.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2F9gq4gUv.jpg&h=6523a508&s={SIZE}\" />"}]}
