Instagram currently requires that users must be at least 13 years old. BuzzFeed News previously reported on Instagram Kids.<br />\n<br />\nInstagram, bought by Facebook almost a decade ago for $1 billion, has become one of its most popular products at a time when its main social networking property has failed to resonate with some younger users.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Increasingly kids are asking their parents if they can join apps that help them keep up with their friends,&rdquo; Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. &ldquo;Right now there aren&rsquo;t many options for parents, so we&rsquo;re working on building additional products -- like we did with Messenger Kids -- that are suitable for kids, managed by parents. We&rsquo;re exploring bringing a parent-controlled experience to Instagram to help kids keep up with their friends, discover new hobbies and interests, and more.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nMessenger Kids is a version of Facebook&rsquo;s messaging app for pre-teens. That app includes a number of parental controls, but a flaw previously allowed some kids to chat with people their parents had not approved. The incident sparked concern from regulators that it didn&rsquo;t adequately protect children.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/facebook-building-a-version-of-instagram-for-kids-under-13?srnd=technology-vp\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2021-03-18%2Ffacebook-building-a-version-of-instagram-for-kids-under-13%3Fsrnd%3Dtechnology-vp&d=Ip59BN4yZo1XWf66eFhBStiuVIf%2Fu6affRELz7PmdGA%3D&h=ae6763a7\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/facebook-building-a-version-of-instagram-for-kids-under-13?srnd=technology-vp</a>"},{"pid":"0cec5aae4b504d9318f31cc97a1b225abc0d673e","tid":2452418,"uid":128102,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-18T23:23:46.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://media4.giphy.com/media/Kwi0Iu9MxxOgg/giphy.gif\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia4.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FKwi0Iu9MxxOgg%2Fgiphy.gif&h=60aac4f3&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"4d18ced5d0a21998aeec4505ef524b9530c38170","tid":2452418,"uid":256837,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-18T23:46:48.000Z","msg":"專洗細路腦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d4bf3acc4ddd61a1371e2528867c1f7cd57744a0","tid":2452418,"uid":110988,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-18T23:47:39.000Z","msg":"幻幻登表示<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/tongue.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5109cc549e88aa5af05ee4e14657f6119cba2315","tid":2452418,"uid":133806,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"0cec5aae4b504d9318f31cc97a1b225abc0d673e","tid":2452418,"uid":128102,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-18T23:23:46.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://media4.giphy.com/media/Kwi0Iu9MxxOgg/giphy.gif\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia4.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FKwi0Iu9MxxOgg%2Fgiphy.gif&h=60aac4f3&s={SIZE}\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-19T01:00:59.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151020160200-biden-thumbs-up-super-169.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F151020160200-biden-thumbs-up-super-169.jpg&h=838a6b40&s={SIZE}\" />"}]}
