avoided by his predecessors.<br />\n<br />\nAt the tail end of a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on the Biden administration's foreign policy agenda, Representative Young Kim (R-CA) noted that Taiwan has served for decades as an &quot;invaluable security and global health partner to the United States.&quot; She pointed out that given Taiwan's contributions to the international community and its &quot;strong democratic system,&quot; it has earned &quot;a seat at the table like the WHO to share its expertise.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nKim then called on the Biden administration to include Taiwan in the upcoming Democracy Summit and to commence talks with it on a free trade agreement. Blinken responded that he is &quot;absolutely committed&quot; to her suggestions and that he shares her view that &quot;Taiwan is a strong democracy&quot; and &quot;a very strong technological power.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"red\">He went on to say that Taiwan is &quot;a country that can contribute to the world, not just its own people. COVID is a very good example of that.&quot; Young agreed with the diplomat's remarks.<br />\n<br />\nBlinken's use of the term &quot;country&quot; could mark a new stage in Taiwan-US relations. </span>Since the U.S. severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan under the Carter administration in 1979, the State Department self-imposed increasing layers of restrictions on official interactions with Taiwan for fear of agitating China.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, toward the end of his term as secretary of state, Mike Pompeo reevaluated these restrictions, recalling to CNA in a March 9 interview that, &quot;We started staring at them and realized it was just crazy. We had this completely separate set of rules that made no sense.&quot; He said that after a full review, &quot;it made sense for us to have more conversations, not fewer. To have more open conversations, not more clandestine conversations.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nOn Jan. 10, the State Department officially lifted its restrictions on official contact with Taiwan. Among those were prohibitions on using the terms &quot;country&quot; or &quot;government&quot; when referring to Taiwan.<br />\n<br />\nBy using the word &quot;country,&quot; Blinken appears to have acknowledged the lifting of restrictions. However, only time will tell whether this was a slip of the tongue or a nod to a long-term policy.<br />\n<br />\n算唔算all talk no action?<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\"
