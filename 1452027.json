Housing. Economic structural reforms. Sustaining global competitiveness. They need to be resolved by HKers, in collaboration with China. As in any realm of problem-solving, only people with skin in the game are the material actors, the rest, colorful noise.<br />\n<br />\nKnow that there are two classes of foreign agitators.<br />\n<br />\nThe first are the warm-&amp;-fuzzy tree-hugging liberal idealistic activist types. They mean well, but these people have never solved any substantial problems in their lives, such as pesky hassles like forklifting 600m people out of famine and poverty in 40 years. One word: Naive. They live in comfortable Middle Class homes, and if they appear not well off, that is because they choose to be poor. This group may be annoying, but harmless.<br />\nThe second group is built around a geopolitical agenda. Destabilizing an ascendant power that threatens their cherished cosy status quo. They had problems with China when it was dirt poor. They have problems with China now that it is rich. Wtf? Their glue of unity is not a secret formal hierarchical controlling organization. Their unity of purpose is abstract, bound by their broad self-interested geopolitical agenda. A sort of global &ldquo;Deep state&rdquo;, without the conspiratorial masonic mystique. Realpolitik. Hardball. Self-evidently, this group is stealthily, deviously dangerous. Well-funded. This group will infiltrate the more politically acceptable, more palatable abovementioned group. Stir the Machiavellian into the naive, and guess how the stew will simmer. This group is multifaceted: Media, political organs, intelligence agencies, international agencies, corporate behemoths, academia, think tanks, whatever. This group is in full veiled flourish in HK as I write this. Go parse the The Economist, WSJ, NYT, CNN, BBC, etc hubristic biases galore: the only worldview is Anglo / Western European."},{"pid":"a4089b82d2b5bcaeb1bc128461db929a2a137b78","tid":1452027,"uid":109683,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-19T15:09:22.000Z","msg":"自推"},{"pid":"a97c27cab0685b42f6ca6cde4845119c9d15d45a","tid":1452027,"uid":109683,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-19T15:09:33.000Z","msg":"自推"},{"pid":"9f07244b5028ed5599b18f4b5ffa1a663adfae38","tid":1452027,"uid":109683,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-19T15:09:44.000Z","msg":"自推"},{"pid":"fba39c88700c57bea45239dca5411890bc4bb3cf","tid":1452027,"uid":109683,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-19T15:09:54.000Z","msg":"自推"},{"pid":"459b9e8508db9a498ec8f03481a9526dc78ee84f","tid":1452027,"uid":109683,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-19T15:10:09.000Z","msg":"自推"},{"pid":"9598286ff68bb636ddc7504ff52f762a389091bc","tid":1452027,"uid":109683,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-19T15:10:20.000Z","msg":"自推"},{"pid":"d906d228ef847c654c0957d5b7bf9c9edd214d6c","tid":1452027,"uid":260195,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-19T15:27:55.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"2d7eb472fbc4d420c355b0d1c2e24e02d7dc119d","tid":1452027,"uid":109683,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-23T01:03:52.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Do-people-of-Shenzhen-have-as-much-freedom-as-people-of-Hong-Kong/answer/Paul-Denlinger\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FDo-people-of-Shenzhen-have-as-much-freedom-as-people-of-Hong-Kong%2Fanswer%2FPaul-Denlinger&d=hP6DzN64O1sWLJLr9GARkb%2F5csivkdzoxKq11rtKUO4%3D&h=d6f4f261\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.quora.com/Do-people-of-Shenzhen-have-as-much-freedom-as-people-of-Hong-Kong/answer/Paul-Denlinger</a><br />\n<br />\nPaul Denlinger<br />\nPaul Denlinger, lives in Hong Kong<br />\nUpdated Aug 20, 2019 &middot; Author has 7.6k answers and 31.9m answer views<br />\nIt&rsquo;s not about freedom, it&rsquo;s about opportunity.<br />\n<br />\nShenzhen is a vibrant and growing city, and is one of China&rsquo;s most competitive. For people willing to learn and work hard, it offers many opportunities for growth. It has world-class companies such as Huawei, Tencent and DJI which make it their headquarters, and other world-class companies such as Apple use it as their center for manufacturing.<br />\n<br />\nPeople who are willing to work hard can move up in Shenzhen.<br />\n<br />\nIn contrast, Hong Kong is 88% dependent on finance, and work opportunities for those outside of finance are very limited. The only thing which has been going up in their lives has been their monthly rent. HKers are fighting for smaller slices of a shrinking pie. The smarter HKers are already working elsewhere in China, and have been for years.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hong Kong media, which is owned largely by the tycoons, have deflected HK public anger from them by placing the blame on China and lack of democracy. Many HKers have bought into this lie. The protesting HKers say that they are fighting for freedom and democracy, but in fact they are protesting the lack of opportunities in HK, even if they don&rsquo;t know it themselves.<br />\n<br />\nIn simple terms, the majority of people in Shenzhen believe that their lives are getting better. In HK, the majority of people in HK believe that their lives are getting worse.<br />\n<br />\nIt has nothing to do with freedom. In fact, freedom won&rsquo;t even help to solve the problem. It is just desperate drowning people grabbing at straws.<br />\n<br />\nWhen you are drowning, you don&rsquo;t think. In fact, you can&rsquo;t think.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s called panic mode.<br />\n<br />\n26.1k views &middot; View 816 Upvoters &middot; View Sharers"},{"pid":"f2558e487af02eedaa0c122f934c76c99b6fa02e","tid":1452027,"uid":293282,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-25T20:58:36.000Z","msg":"Quora真係好痴線... 原來呢排我地剩係講Quora，已經起碼有下面幾個post...<br />\n<br />\n我諗我地要組織Quora文宣...<br />\n<br />\n------------------------------------------<br />\n<br />\n[國際文宣] 點解Quora上面一面倒五毛抺黑示威者？我地d人呢？<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://lihkg.com/thread/1506460/page/1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lihkg.com/thread/1506460/page/1</a><br />\n<br />\n[文宣戰] Quora極多深藍分析撚<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://lihkg.com/thread/1492780/page/1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lihkg.com/thread/1492780/page/1</a><br />\n<br />\n［跪求文宣］有餘力請去quora消毒<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://lihkg.com/thread/1452027/page/1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lihkg.com/thread/1452027/page/1</a><br />\n<br />\n[對外宣傳] Quora有好撚多五毛<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://lihkg.com/thread/1382303/page/1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lihkg.com/thread/1382303/page/1</a>"}]}
