As it whisked across the night sky at 18,000 miles (29,000 kilometers) per hour, the satellite beamed down a small data packet to a ground station in Xinglong, a couple of hours&rsquo; drive to the northeast of Beijing</strong>. Less than an hour later, the satellite passed over Austria and dispatched another data packet to a station near the city of Graz.⋯⋯⋯<br />\n<br />\nthe Micius satellite&mdash;named for an ancient Chinese scientist and philosopher&mdash;is very much a result of international cooperation.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>It came out of a collaboration between a team led by Pan and another led by Anton Zeilinger, a quantum physicist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. <span style=\"color: red;\">Zeilinger was Pan&rsquo;s doctoral supervisor in the 1990s</span></strong>, and he saw potential in the young Chinese student. &ldquo;When he came here, he was one hundred percent focused on theoretical physics,&rdquo; recalls Zeilinger. &ldquo;But I realized he could do more, so I suggested he switch to experiments, and he did that very successfully.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nSo successfully, in fact, that Zeilinger was only too happy when his former student proposed a collaboration on intercontinental QKD in 2011. Pan&rsquo;s team had already conducted experiments over a number of years to prove a space-based system could work, and it eventually got the Chinese government&rsquo;s green light to build a dedicated satellite, which was launched in 2016.<br />\n<br />\n⋯⋯ Pan says the money devoted to an upcoming national quantum plan for China will be &ldquo;at least the same order of magnitude&rdquo; as Europe&rsquo;s recently launched Quantum Technologies Flagship project, a 10-year, &euro;1 billion ($1.1 billion) initiative.<br />\n<br />\nWhile money matters, there&rsquo;s more to China&rsquo;s success than the bankrolling of satellites and other projects<span style=\"color: red;\">. The country also benefits from a decades-long strategy of sending young researchers abroad to learn from experts like Zeilinger and then enticing them home to continue their work.</span><br />\n<br />\nChina is producing plenty of high-quality quantum science papers, and the number of Chinese patents being registered in areas like quantum communications and quantum cryptography has also soared, far surpassing those being registered in the US and elsewhere.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612596/the-man-turning-china-into-a-quantum-superpower/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com%2Fs%2F612596%2Fthe-man-turning-china-into-a-quantum-superpower%2F&d=rje4l1xmTn6y9o%2BHBfPaf6ha%2BoeUeRXR1jLQ0PybHu0%3D&h=4b76ef18\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612596/the-man-turning-china-into-a-quantum-superpower/</a><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"da975b004407a80162ac1f87571671fbe4e1d143","tid":1022396,"uid":48083,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-15T03:52:51.000Z","msg":"中國科學技術大學：<br />\n<br />\n我校5位教授入選中組部「千人計劃」<br />\n<br />\n    近日，接教育部和科技部的通知，我校<span style=\"color: red;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">潘建偉</span></span>、趙政國、羅毅、張振宇、陸亞林等5位教授入選2008年度中組部「千人計劃」。本年度全國高校入選人數為56人，我校是入選人數最多的高校之一。<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://fgy.ustc.edu.cn/2009/0525/c6968a94503/page.htm\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffgy.ustc.edu.cn%2F2009%2F0525%2Fc6968a94503%2Fpage.htm&d=rje4l1xmTn6y9o%2BHBfPaf6ha%2BoeUeRXR1jLQ0PybHu0%3D&h=2139640d\" target=\"_blank\">http://fgy.ustc.edu.cn/2009/0525/c6968a94503/page.htm</a><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/2e623yR.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2F2e623yR.png&h=32928ca5&s={SIZE}\" /><img src=\"https://na.cx/i/UE7E5Nc.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FUE7E5Nc.png&h=2a696719&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"fe954a6caba4886b3ff81f95738521e42f74f68a","tid":1022396,"uid":14918,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-15T04:02:00.000Z","msg":"係奧地利先岩"},{"pid":"4185effc1e613f2aba6319b98204265fa105ae3d","tid":1022396,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-15T04:37:19.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2lny/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2lny/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2lny/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8af8f37bc3cb93f2eb1de3d8ea731a318a12e649","tid":1022396,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-15T06:45:51.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a7eb1f4cd3613cd3e1a0e6d9ecbf319eb695becb","tid":1022396,"uid":29702,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-15T07:04:00.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"a5b8e3c1a45fdf1db00f534b444980936112c360","tid":1022396,"uid":31389,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-15T08:05:57.000Z","msg":"一不靠偷二不靠搶<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"23c192314f2b485452bf2c0884e1cc6601399d41","tid":1022396,"uid":79563,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-15T08:10:12.000Z","msg":"「千人計劃」 = 「老千呃人計劃」"},{"pid":"4d2322f9332ee85a43bac5f9ab63a6242d249cae","tid":1022396,"uid":3020,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a5b8e3c1a45fdf1db00f534b444980936112c360","tid":1022396,"uid":31389,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-15T08:05:57.000Z","msg":"一不靠偷二不靠搶<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-15T11:35:29.000Z","msg":"三直接抄"}]}
