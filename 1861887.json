<br />\n<br />\nIn recent years he became more and more pro-china and recent events made our gathering a little tense and uneasy as we have diverged in views yet we still try to embrace each other. We saw less of each others. I didn't understand why he would turn so blue, he's not rich, not a  landlord. He worked hard starting from a messenger boy to becoming a Finance Director in a sizable US company. He didn't study hard as a boy but he made it up as a man, he has an MBA and a DBA. Despite all the effort, he still had to live in the same place he grew up in. He didn't benefit shit from Hk stock or property market at all. So I couldn't understand why he would like this government.<br />\n <br />\nHe was a rebel as a kid, he was the cool kid in school, did all the wrong but fun things while i'd only studied all the time. So when he started working, he was the one that had to work extra hard to make up from his slow start. Maybe he disagreed with this rebellious past, that's why he don't agree with the rebellious yellow and black. Why didn't i think of this sooner to understand and embrace? For this i cannot forgive myself for being a shallow and judgmental friend. <br />\n<br />\nBut had we not drifted apart in the past months, we might have all gathered at my home with my kids and parents over CNY. Or, he might have told me he's in self-quarantine at home. Or, I might have helped convince him not to go to wuhan in the first place. Guess I will never know. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who don't know him, his name is Barry Lam, 林達鋒, he was one of the best and most honourable man i know. He was kind, loving, forgiving and generous. He was a good friend, a good son and a good father and maybe too good a husband. He went to wuhan coz he loves his wife too much as he wants to bring her and the kids to see grandpa. We can judge and say its stupid, so stupid it cost his life. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who have read about him and his family in the news or some chat groups, if those in the groups are truly your friends, please share this message with them. Let them know the true Barry. He is a real person. He is like everyone of us. He may be blue and you may hate that, but try to understand and embrace why he had made that choice for whatever reasons. Even if you can't, at least don't judge, for we are not god. Help end the hate and resentment, let him rest in peace. <br />\n<br />\nThere are so much hatred in this world now it took the death of my best friend to set my perspective straight. I hope these kinda tragedy would not happen to anyone ever again. But shit will always happen. So love you friend, love your family and don't hold back, show them you do. You will only know it's too late when it's too late. <br />\n<br />\nWish you all peace and

friend wrote the following message about the 1st victim died in this health crisis in HK:<br />\n<br />\nI met him in Form 2, he was my best friend and my big brother in high school and we have been close since then. <br />\n<br />\nIn recent years he became more and more pro-china and recent events made our gathering a little tense and uneasy as we have diverged in views yet we still try to embrace each other. We saw less of each others. I didn't understand why he would turn so blue, he's not rich, not a  landlord. He worked hard starting from a messenger boy to becoming a Finance Director in a sizable US company. He didn't study hard as a boy but he made it up as a man, he has an MBA and a DBA. Despite all the effort, he still had to live in the same place he grew up in. He didn't benefit shit from Hk stock or property market at all. So I couldn't understand why he would like this government.<br />\n <br />\nHe was a rebel as a kid, he was the cool kid in school, did all the wrong but fun things while i'd only studied all the time. So when he started working, he was the one that had to work extra hard to make up from his slow start. Maybe he disagreed with this rebellious past, that's why he don't agree with the rebellious yellow and black. Why didn't i think of this sooner to understand and embrace? For this i cannot forgive myself for being a shallow and judgmental friend. <br />\n<br />\nBut had we not drifted apart in the past months, we might have all gathered at my home with my kids and parents over CNY. Or, he might have told me he's in self-quarantine at home. Or, I might have helped convince him not to go to wuhan in the first place. Guess I will never know. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who don't know him, his name is Barry Lam, 林達鋒, he was one of the best and most honourable man i know. He was kind, loving, forgiving and generous. He was a good friend, a good son and a good father and maybe too good a husband. He went to wuhan coz he loves his wife too much as he wants to bring her and the kids to see grandpa. We can judge and say its stupid, so stupid it cost his life. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who have read about him and his family in the news or some chat groups, if those in the groups are truly your friends, please share this message with them. Let them know the true Barry. He is a real person. He is like everyone of us. He may be blue and you may hate that, but try to understand and embrace why he had made that choice for whatever reasons. Even if you can't, at least don't judge, for we are not god.

friend wrote the following message about the 1st victim died in this health crisis in HK:<br />\n<br />\nI met him in Form 2, he was my best friend and my big brother in high school and we have been close since then. <br />\n<br />\nIn recent years he became more and more pro-china and recent events made our gathering a little tense and uneasy as we have diverged in views yet we still try to embrace each other. We saw less of each others. I didn't understand why he would turn so blue, he's not rich, not a  landlord. He worked hard starting from a messenger boy to becoming a Finance Director in a sizable US company. He didn't study hard as a boy but he made it up as a man, he has an MBA and a DBA. Despite all the effort, he still had to live in the same place he grew up in. He didn't benefit shit from Hk stock or property market at all. So I couldn't understand why he would like this government.<br />\n <br />\nHe was a rebel as a kid, he was the cool kid in school, did all the wrong but fun things while i'd only studied all the time. So when he started working, he was the one that had to work extra hard to make up from his slow start. Maybe he disagreed with this rebellious past, that's why he don't agree with the rebellious yellow and black. Why didn't i think of this sooner to understand and embrace? For this i cannot forgive myself for being a shallow and judgmental friend. <br />\n<br />\nBut had we not drifted apart in the past months, we might have all gathered at my home with my kids and parents over CNY. Or, he might have told me he's in self-quarantine at home. Or, I might have helped convince him not to go to wuhan in the first place. Guess I will never know. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who don't know him, his name is Barry Lam, 林達鋒, he was one of the best and most honourable man i know. He was kind, loving, forgiving and generous. He was a good friend, a good son and a good father and maybe too good a husband. He went to wuhan coz he loves his wife too much as he wants to bring her and the kids to see grandpa. We can judge and say its stupid, so stupid it cost his life. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who have read about him and his family in the news or some chat groups, if those in the groups are truly your friends, please share this message with them. Let them know the true Barry. He is a real person. He is like everyone of us. He may be blue and you may hate that, but try to understand and embrace why he had made that choice for whatever reasons. Even if you can't, at least don't judge, for we are not god. Help end the hate and resentment, let him rest in peace. <br />\n<br />\nThere are so much hatred in this world now it took the death of my best friend to set my perspective straight. I hope these kinda tragedy would not happen to anyone ever again. But shit will always happen. So love you friend, love your family and don't hold back, show them you do. You will only know it's too late when it's too late. <br />\n<br />\nWish you all peace and health."},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:28:56.000Z","msg":"睇完仲想笑<br />\n<img

friend wrote the following message about the 1st victim died in this health crisis in HK:<br />\n<br />\nI met him in Form 2, he was my best friend and my big brother in high school and we have been close since then. <br />\n<br />\nIn recent years he became more and more pro-china and recent events made our gathering a little tense and uneasy as we have diverged in views yet we still try to embrace each other. We saw less of each others. I didn't understand why he would turn so blue, he's not rich, not a  landlord. He worked hard starting from a messenger boy to becoming a Finance Director in a sizable US company. He didn't study hard as a boy but he made it up as a man, he has an MBA and a DBA. Despite all the effort, he still had to live in the same place he grew up in. He didn't benefit shit from Hk stock or property market at all. So I couldn't understand why he would like this government.<br />\n <br />\nHe was a rebel as a kid, he was the cool kid in school, did all the wrong but fun things while i'd only studied all the time. So when he started working, he was the one that had to work extra hard to make up from his slow start. Maybe he disagreed with this rebellious past, that's why he don't agree with the rebellious yellow and black. Why didn't i think of this sooner to understand and embrace? For this i cannot forgive myself for being a shallow and judgmental friend. <br />\n<br />\nBut had we not drifted apart in the past months, we might have all gathered at my home with my kids and parents over CNY. Or, he might have told me he's in self-quarantine at home. Or, I might have helped convince him not to go to wuhan in the first place. Guess I will never know. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who don't know him, his name is Barry Lam, 林達鋒, he was one of the best and most honourable man i know. He was kind, loving, forgiving and generous. He was a good friend, a good son and a good father and maybe too good a husband. He went to wuhan coz he loves his wife too much as he wants to bring her and the kids to see grandpa. We can judge and say its stupid, so stupid it cost his life. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who have read about him and his family in the news or some chat groups, if those in the groups are truly your friends, please share this message with them. Let them know the true Barry. He is a real person. He is like everyone of us. He may be blue and you may hate that, but try to understand and embrace why he had made that choice for whatever reasons. Even if you can't, at least don't judge, for we are not god. Help end the hate and resentment, let him rest in peace. <br />\n<br />\nThere are so much hatred in this world now it took the death of my best friend to set my perspective straight. I hope these kinda tragedy would not happen to anyone ever again. But shit will always happen. So love you friend, love your family and don't hold back, show them you do. You will only know it's too late when it's too late. <br />\n<br />\nWish you all peace and health."},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:34:49.000Z","msg":"新年仲去武漢<br />\n一個字 抵死"},{"pid":"f6f7ac6e0011db3e5858bf83a11b82886aa95610","tid":1861887,"uid":89557,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:34:56.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1d67d51dc685401d45e938b38360c31952d731f7","tid":1861887,"uid":346701,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:34:57.000Z","msg":"一家人最緊要齊齊整整"},{"pid":"d5da55ed05a50becc81b3d2894b7732be4528fa1","tid":1861887,"uid":39830,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:35:13.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />祝一家早日團聚<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"9aa3af7801ba650e179972553867ded4a56dcbbf","tid":1861887,"uid":310324,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"3221b2bc295425342ee83654fdcebb1f12d89b3c","tid":1861887,"uid":24570,"like":26,"dislike":0,"score":26,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T10:46:20.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/smile2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />來生要做個中國人"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:35:36.000Z","msg":"點解一定係人<br />\n只要對中国有利<br />\n做隻豬做隻雞都可以<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/smile2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"3de56de3adbaf865d111e35deef9d8975d095ad2","tid":1861887,"uid":224829,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:35:57.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"6325a1143f32f119addc572acefcbc9a31f23d15","tid":1861887,"uid":297453,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:35:59.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/DayskmB.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FDayskmB.jpg&h=ef7e1c9a&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"c19212b1890449ea17b883f412fe9cafb51ebdb1","tid":1861887,"uid":327275,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:36:12.000Z","msg":"佢其實並非死於肺炎，而係死於藍色腦炎。"},{"pid":"de7ae3bfeef0260d25fe5559f7f73142f94cc259","tid":1861887,"uid":179414,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:36:12.000Z","msg":"佢老母白頭人送黑頭人好撚慘<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n唔緊要，好快成家排隊落去一家團聚<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"10361c8018723fa29d2b7a666a7a726e0d8c5cf9","tid":1861887,"uid":265411,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"9aa3af7801ba650e179972553867ded4a56dcbbf","tid":1861887,"uid":310324,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"3221b2bc295425342ee83654fdcebb1f12d89b3c","tid":1861887,"uid":24570,"like":26,"dislike":0,"score":26,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T10:46:20.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/smile2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />來生要做個中國人"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:35:36.000Z","msg":"點解一定係人<br />\n只要對中国有利<br />\n做隻豬做隻雞都可以<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/smile2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:36:32.000Z","msg":"岩聽<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/biggrin.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"dfe1f8b49949458859c49837ff169dbfe70a9262","tid":1861887,"uid":14941,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:36:33.000Z","msg":"blue c gg"},{"pid":"cfed3927b8664c1f5a723ce1bb3bc097b1433f51","tid":1861887,"uid":34352,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T11:36:44.000Z","msg":"抵撚死<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1795252d16ce7d76ce966200e7afe66637cf243c","tid":1861887,"uid":259984,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"3db2c1a83b42414d392497af8c685b7ad4947dfc","tid":1861887,"uid":65371,"like":7,"dislike":29,"score":-22,"citedBy":13,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T10:45:02.000Z","msg":"🙏🏻My friend wrote the following message about the 1st victim died in this health crisis in HK:<br />\n<br />\nI met him in Form 2, he was my best friend and my big brother in high school and we have been close since then. <br />\n<br />\nIn recent years he became more and more pro-china and recent events made our gathering a little tense and uneasy as we have diverged in views yet we still try to embrace each other.

friend wrote the following message about the 1st victim died in this health crisis in HK:<br />\n<br />\nI met him in Form 2, he was my best friend and my big brother in high school and we have been close since then. <br />\n<br />\nIn recent years he became more and more pro-china and recent events made our gathering a little tense and uneasy as we have diverged in views yet we still try to embrace each other. We saw less of each others. I didn't understand why he would turn so blue, he's not rich, not a  landlord. He worked hard starting from a messenger boy to becoming a Finance Director in a sizable US company. He didn't study hard as a boy but he made it up as a man, he has an MBA and a DBA. Despite all the effort, he still had to live in the same place he grew up in. He didn't benefit shit from Hk stock or property market at all. So I couldn't understand why he would like this government.<br />\n <br />\nHe was a rebel as a kid, he was the cool kid in school, did all the wrong but fun things while i'd only studied all the time. So when he started working, he was the one that had to work extra hard to make up from his slow start. Maybe he disagreed with this rebellious past, that's why he don't agree with the rebellious yellow and black. Why didn't i think of this sooner to understand and embrace? For this i cannot forgive myself for being a shallow and judgmental friend. <br />\n<br />\nBut had we not drifted apart in the past months, we might have all gathered at my home with my kids and parents over CNY. Or, he might have told me he's in self-quarantine at home. Or, I might have helped convince him not to go to wuhan in the first place. Guess I will never know. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who don't know him, his name is Barry Lam, 林達鋒, he was one of the best and most honourable man i know. He was kind, loving, forgiving and generous. He was a good friend, a good son and a good father and maybe too good a husband. He went to wuhan coz he loves his wife too much as he wants to bring her and the kids to see grandpa. We can judge and say its stupid, so stupid it cost his life. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who have read about him and his family in the news or some chat groups, if those in the groups are truly your friends, please share this message with them. Let them know the true Barry. He is a real person. He is like everyone of us. He may be blue and you may hate that, but try to understand and embrace why he had made that choice for whatever reasons. Even if you can't, at least don't judge, for we are not god. Help end the hate and resentment, let him rest in peace. <br />\n<br />\nThere are so much hatred in this world now it took the death of my best friend to set my perspective straight. I hope these kinda tragedy would not happen to anyone ever again. But shit will always happen. So love you friend, love your family and don't hold back, show them you do. You will only know it's too late when it's too late. <br />\n<br />\nWish you all peace and health."},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T12:10:05.000Z","msg":"He is a real person.

embrace each other. We saw less of each others. I didn't understand why he would turn so blue, he's not rich, not a  landlord. He worked hard starting from a messenger boy to becoming a Finance Director in a sizable US company. He didn't study hard as a boy but he made it up as a man, he has an MBA and a DBA. Despite all the effort, he still had to live in the same place he grew up in. He didn't benefit shit from Hk stock or property market at all. So I couldn't understand why he would like this government.<br />\n <br />\nHe was a rebel as a kid, he was the cool kid in school, did all the wrong but fun things while i'd only studied all the time. So when he started working, he was the one that had to work extra hard to make up from his slow start. Maybe he disagreed with this rebellious past, that's why he don't agree with the rebellious yellow and black. Why didn't i think of this sooner to understand and embrace? For this i cannot forgive myself for being a shallow and judgmental friend. <br />\n<br />\nBut had we not drifted apart in the past months, we might have all gathered at my home with my kids and parents over CNY. Or, he might have told me he's in self-quarantine at home. Or, I might have helped convince him not to go to wuhan in the first place. Guess I will never know. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who don't know him, his name is Barry Lam, 林達鋒, he was one of the best and most honourable man i know. He was kind, loving, forgiving and generous. He was a good friend, a good son and a good father and maybe too good a husband. He went to wuhan coz he loves his wife too much as he wants to bring her and the kids to see grandpa. We can judge and say its stupid, so stupid it cost his life. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who have read about him and his family in the news or some chat groups, if those in the groups are truly your friends, please share this message with them. Let them know the true Barry. He is a real person. He is like everyone of us. He may be blue and you may hate that, but try to understand and embrace why he had made that choice for whatever reasons. Even if you can't, at least don't judge, for we are not god. Help end the hate and resentment, let him rest in peace. <br />\n<br />\nThere are so much hatred in this world now it took the death of my best friend to set my perspective straight. I hope these kinda tragedy would not happen to anyone ever again. But shit will always happen. So love you friend, love your family and don't hold back, show them you do.

friend wrote the following message about the 1st victim died in this health crisis in HK:<br />\n<br />\nI met him in Form 2, he was my best friend and my big brother in high school and we have been close since then. <br />\n<br />\nIn recent years he became more and more pro-china and recent events made our gathering a little tense and uneasy as we have diverged in views yet we still try to embrace each other. We saw less of each others. I didn't understand why he would turn so blue, he's not rich, not a  landlord. He worked hard starting from a messenger boy to becoming a Finance Director in a sizable US company. He didn't study hard as a boy but he made it up as a man, he has an MBA and a DBA. Despite all the effort, he still had to live in the same place he grew up in. He didn't benefit shit from Hk stock or property market at all. So I couldn't understand why he would like this government.<br />\n <br />\nHe was a rebel as a kid, he was the cool kid in school, did all the wrong but fun things while i'd only studied all the time. So when he started working, he was the one that had to work extra hard to make up from his slow start. Maybe he disagreed with this rebellious past, that's why he don't agree with the rebellious yellow and black. Why didn't i think of this sooner to understand and embrace? For this i cannot forgive myself for being a shallow and judgmental friend. <br />\n<br />\nBut had we not drifted apart in the past months, we might have all gathered at my home with my kids and parents over CNY. Or, he might have told me he's in self-quarantine at home. Or, I might have helped convince him not to go to wuhan in the first place. Guess I will never know. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who don't know him, his name is Barry Lam, 林達鋒, he was one of the best and most honourable man i know. He was kind, loving, forgiving and generous. He was a good friend, a good son and a good father and maybe too good a husband. He went to wuhan coz he loves his wife too much as he wants to bring her and the kids to see grandpa. We can judge and say its stupid, so stupid it cost his life. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who have read about him and his family in the news or some chat groups, if those in the groups are truly your friends, please share this message with them. Let them know the true Barry. He is a real person. He is like everyone of us. He may be blue and you may hate that, but try to understand and embrace why he had made that choice for whatever reasons. Even if you can't, at least don't judge, for we are not god. Help end the hate and resentment, let him rest in peace. <br />\n<br />\nThere are so much hatred in this world now it took the death of my best friend to set my perspective straight. I hope these kinda tragedy would not happen to anyone ever again. But shit will always happen. So love you friend, love your family and don't hold back, show them you do. You will only know it's too late when it's too late. <br />\n<br />\nWish you all peace and health."},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T12:10:05.000Z","msg":"He is a real person.

friend wrote the following message about the 1st victim died in this health crisis in HK:<br />\n<br />\nI met him in Form 2, he was my best friend and my big brother in high school and we have been close since then. <br />\n<br />\nIn recent years he became more and more pro-china and recent events made our gathering a little tense and uneasy as we have diverged in views yet we still try to embrace each other. We saw less of each others. I didn't understand why he would turn so blue, he's not rich, not a  landlord. He worked hard starting from a messenger boy to becoming a Finance Director in a sizable US company. He didn't study hard as a boy but he made it up as a man, he has an MBA and a DBA. Despite all the effort, he still had to live in the same place he grew up in. He didn't benefit shit from Hk stock or property market at all. So I couldn't understand why he would like this government.<br />\n <br />\nHe was a rebel as a kid, he was the cool kid in school, did all the wrong but fun things while i'd only studied all the time. So when he started working, he was the one that had to work extra hard to make up from his slow start. Maybe he disagreed with this rebellious past, that's why he don't agree with the rebellious yellow and black. Why didn't i think of this sooner to understand and embrace? For this i cannot forgive myself for being a shallow and judgmental friend. <br />\n<br />\nBut had we not drifted apart in the past months, we might have all gathered at my home with my kids and parents over CNY. Or, he might have told me he's in self-quarantine at home. Or, I might have helped convince him not to go to wuhan in the first place. Guess I will never know. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who don't know him, his name is Barry Lam, 林達鋒, he was one of the best and most honourable man i know. He was kind, loving, forgiving and generous. He was a good friend, a good son and a good father and maybe too good a husband. He went to wuhan coz he loves his wife too much as he wants to bring her and the kids to see grandpa. We can judge and say its stupid, so stupid it cost his life. <br />\n<br />\nFor those who have read about him and his family in the news or some chat groups, if those in the groups are truly your friends, please share this message with them. Let them know the true Barry. He is a real person. He is like everyone of us. He may be blue and you may hate that, but try to understand and embrace why he had made that choice for whatever reasons. Even if you can't, at least don't judge, for we are not god. Help end the hate and resentment, let him rest in peace. <br />\n<br />\nThere are so much hatred in this world now it took the death of my best friend to set my perspective straight. I hope these kinda tragedy would not happen to anyone ever again. But shit will always happen. So love you friend, love your family and don't hold back, show them you do. You will only know it's too late when it's too late. <br />\n<br />\nWish you all peace and health."},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T12:10:05.000Z","msg":"He is a real person.
