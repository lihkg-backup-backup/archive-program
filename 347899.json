Our thoughts are with his family.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, in the various reports of the accident by TVB News, the footage of Inspiration B-KOO returning from her Round-the-World Journey last year was used. The Inspiration Team is extremely confused and hereby makes the following statement.<br />\n1. The Inspiration Team, and the team's sponsors and supporting organisations are not related to the accident.<br />\n2. Inspiration B-KOO is not involved in any accident.<br />\n3. The plane involved in the accident is not of the same model as Inspiration B-KOO."},{"pid":"761ce7b68da0df4e59f9738ee873e3c89d07f154","tid":347899,"uid":1876,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-05T12:38:02.000Z","msg":"段鳩估"}]}
