Twelve nautical miles is an internationally recognized territorial limit.<br />\n<br />\nThe Paracels are occupied entirely by China but also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan.<br />\n<br />\nA spokesman for the Royal Navy said: &quot;HMS Albion exercised her rights for freedom of navigation in full compliance with international law and norms.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nNeither China's Foreign nor Defence Ministries immediately responded to a request for comment.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: orange;\">Freedom of Navigation</span></strong><br />\n<br />\nChina's claims in the South China Sea, through which some $3 trillion of shipborne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Britain does not have any territorial claims in the area.<br />\n<br />\nWhile the U.S. Navy has conducted Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in the same area in the past, this British challenge to China's growing control of the strategic waterway comes after the United States has said it would like to see more international participation in such actions.<br />\n<br />\nBoth Britain and the United States say they conduct FONOP operations throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies.<br />\n<br />\nThe British Navy has previously sailed close to the disputed Spratly Islands, further south in the South China Sea, but not within the 12 nautical mile limit, diplomatic sources have said.<br />\n<br />\nFONOPs, which are largely symbolic, have so far not persuaded Beijing to curtail its South China Sea activities, which have included extensive reclamation of reefs and islands and the construction of runways, hangars and missile systems.<br />\n<br />\nBeijing says it is entitled to build on its territories and says the facilities are for civilian use and necessary self-defense purposes. China blames Washington for militarizing the region with its freedom of navigation patrols.<br />\n<br />\nForeign aircraft and vessels in the region are routinely challenged by Chinese naval ships and monitoring stations on the fortified islands, sources have said previously.<br />\n<br />\nIn April, warships from Australia &mdash; which like Britain is a close U.S. ally &mdash; had what Canberra described as a close &quot;encounter&quot; with Chinese naval vessels in the contested sea."},{"pid":"52668cc26a336f4aef0cfbe6a8b1356e66a0d594","tid":808117,"uid":63154,"like":9,"dislike":0,"score":9,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-06T06:01:48.000Z","msg":"唔順氣就開火，唔好咁多廢話<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/give.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"11aa2643cef58e74e8292d72bcf73a5386321cfc","tid":808117,"uid":160414,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-06T06:02:51.000Z","msg":"企開啲啦屌你老母"},{"pid":"3d1611a1ee9ccb280a9562f57ceb6358899f5ed6","tid":808117,"uid":47359,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-06T06:03:33.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">打啦得個講字</span>"},{"pid":"95ee63bab81bebedbf1192ca3115e435e07b0644","tid":808117,"uid":79563,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-06T16:14:25.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/biggrin.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"694ebf0dd7b5d9ef8a7d461f74e1ede7df6d8938","tid":808117,"uid":189934,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-07T11:14:30.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"53434cca2ecd7a6eb401139bd4e4c830d38c1901","tid":808117,"uid":153239,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-07T11:19:58.000Z","msg":"呢隻咩艦黎<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 四四方方"},{"pid":"53a18a7600b5d77cef1bc8930fefd80cad012c9b","tid":808117,"uid":153239,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"53434cca2ecd7a6eb401139bd4e4c830d38c1901","tid":808117,"uid":153239,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-09-07T11:19:58.000Z","msg":"呢隻咩艦黎<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 四四方方"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-07T11:20:34.000Z","msg":"原來係影左屎忽<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
