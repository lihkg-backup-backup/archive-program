The company did seem to have somewhat succeeded in finding its own identity more recently, but it&rsquo;s back to its old tricks with its latest Mi 9 smartphone, due to launch on Sunday &hellip;<br />\n<br />\nThe Verge spotted a teaser image of the phone.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The signature wallpaper for Apple&rsquo;s macOS Mojave features sand dunes, segmented by a pretty undulating curve, and it changes with the time of your computer so you see light dunes in the day and a dark scene at night. It&rsquo;s a neat, organic little feature. It&rsquo;s also been shamelessly ripped off by Xiaomi, whose latest flagship device, the Mi 9, doesn&rsquo;t even try to have a different background and just recreates the entire idea of colors shifting with the time of day.</strong> I guess Xiaomi will want credit for expanding the color palette a little, but I&rsquo;ve got none to give. This is embarrassingly obvious and unnecessarily brazen [&hellip;]<br />\n<br />\nThis Xiaomi move runs counter to the design and engineering goodwill that the company has been building up over the past couple of years. It&rsquo;s a deliberate sidestep from just copying the iPhone&rsquo;s wallpaper, which Xiaomi has done in the past, and it&rsquo;s indicative of a company that seems unwilling to rely solely on its own ideas and capabilities.<br />\n<br />\nXiaomi has in the past copied almost every element of its product range and marketing from Apple. It named its first products the Mi Phone and Mi Pad.<br />\n<br />\nIts first Mi Pad was a blatant copy of the iPad mini, both in terms of the hardware and a forked version of Android intended to provide an iOS-like UI. Last year&rsquo;s Mi 8 was a close copy of the iPhone X design. And this year&rsquo;s AirDots are an obvious copy of Apple&rsquo;s AirPods.<br />\n<br />\nWhen it came to marketing, Xiaomi stole everything from Apple&rsquo;s website design to its keynote presentation format, right the way down to its CEO wearing blue jeans and black turtleneck shirt and using the phrase &lsquo;One More Thing.&rsquo;"},{"pid":"af2e7193dff1a964138436088715fdd1777953f7","tid":1029929,"uid":181294,"like":0,"dislike":4,"score":-4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T15:10:13.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"505e35db3db7061a1c5a69fdcf37fa4905452730","tid":1029929,"uid":181294,"like":1,"dislike":3,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T15:10:34.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"d99232b97ccfa3220113b56829935f8caeb4aeeb","tid":1029929,"uid":191815,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T17:28:09.000Z","msg":"Mojave張Wallpaper?<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"2a52ad8959610115cabf14fc0f807a6395dd705d","tid":1029929,"uid":198503,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"quote":{"pid":"505e35db3db7061a1c5a69fdcf37fa4905452730","tid":1029929,"uid":181294,"like":1,"dislike":3,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T15:10:34.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T17:29:44.000Z","msg":"喺香港讀書唔識英文<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f0004ba4341eefc7aaa993bdafd530a89e64919a","tid":1029929,"uid":51271,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"2a52ad8959610115cabf14fc0f807a6395dd705d","tid":1029929,"uid":198503,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"quote":{"pid":"505e35db3db7061a1c5a69fdcf37fa4905452730","tid":1029929,"uid":181294,"like":1,"dislike":3,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T15:10:34.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T17:29:44.000Z","msg":"喺香港讀書唔識英文<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T23:14:22.000Z","msg":"五毛嚟"},{"pid":"1f9049c93423073d256e4489e4e27d6b3020567e","tid":1029929,"uid":51271,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"d99232b97ccfa3220113b56829935f8caeb4aeeb","tid":1029929,"uid":191815,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T17:28:09.000Z","msg":"Mojave張Wallpaper?<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-21T00:06:59.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/hk/macos/mojave/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fhk%2Fmacos%2Fmojave%2F&d=WIvcVJ42Qixy%2BOT8%2FM1n819PyQTEnBXXUT3Ba6PvfAw%3D&h=1f2407e6\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.apple.com/hk/macos/mojave/</a><br />\n<br />\nApple又坐時光機抄屌米"},{"pid":"7601cec45ebfee0ed5a9b6597580b0e519aaede0","tid":1029929,"uid":8410,"like":5,"dislike":1,"score":4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-21T00:09:22.000Z","msg":"都唔明點解全世界要抄M 額， 好在小米&amp; samsung 都改邪歸正"},{"pid":"7867f8fc0277d545ac4d023186fa4bcd69582b6e","tid":1029929,"uid":194415,"like":4,"dislike":1,"score":3,"quote":{"pid":"7601cec45ebfee0ed5a9b6597580b0e519aaede0","tid":1029929,"uid":8410,"like":5,"dislike":1,"score":4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-21T00:09:22.000Z","msg":"都唔明點解全世界要抄M 額， 好在小米&amp; samsung 都改邪歸正"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-21T00:25:31.000Z","msg":"唔覺得痔瘡好過m 額"},{"pid":"8448398d910e41a7ca139844d47b968d3d05b04b","tid":1029929,"uid":48419,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"2a52ad8959610115cabf14fc0f807a6395dd705d","tid":1029929,"uid":198503,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"quote":{"pid":"505e35db3db7061a1c5a69fdcf37fa4905452730","tid":1029929,"uid":181294,"like":1,"dislike":3,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T15:10:34.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T17:29:44.000Z","msg":"喺香港讀書唔識英文<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-21T00:35:44.000Z","msg":"手機台咁多支那人好難講"},{"pid":"e00784cd973359c7846b69c7c160c7d4784efe7a","tid":1029929,"uid":120709,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-21T08:16:09.000Z","msg":"只係睇得明4張圖,D部幾大MON"},{"pid":"a1f681b8b42f85c02b876d9d162b856ebbda1ef2","tid":1029929,"uid":88878,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-21T08:33:21.000Z","msg":"小米自主研發左好多年架啦<br />\n好似apple咁完成之後幾年先實際應用"}]}
