Your monologue is always entertaining yet it delivers important messages to the world on righteousness and freedom.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Who kills its own kind on his birthday?&rdquo;<br />\nCHINA.<br />\n<br />\nWe are writing to ask for your help as Hong Kong is now experiencing a serious humanitarian crisis.  On 1st October, a HK police officer fired live rounds at a young protester&rsquo;s chest.  This protester is a high school student who is currently in ICU with a critical medical condition.  Here&rsquo;s the video footage:<br />\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/KnAcFz20qAw\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FKnAcFz20qAw&d=JxnAwUrH%2B1qYxVTFfur%2BViBzIW6ugq8wWEqYO2LRYLo%3D&h=7b5ec75e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/KnAcFz20qAw</a><br />\n<br />\nAs you can see clearly from the video, the moment the police officer fired a bullet at the protester&rsquo;s chest, the officer&rsquo;s life was at no risk.  The fact that he was marching towards the crowd with his gun pointing at them, instead of stepping backwards proves that he was not self-defending, but aggressive.  The shooting was completely unreasonable, violent and brutal.  This is undoubtedly a violation of human rights.  <br />\n<br />\nHong Kong people need your help to spread the police brutality to the world because there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to sanction these inhuman acts in Hong Kong.  Please, you are our last hope.  If you believe in freedom, if you believe in justice, if you believe the very basic human rights, please feature this shocking video in your next Late Show with Stephen Colbert.<br />\n<br />\nThank you for your kind attention.<br />\n<br />\nRegards,<br />\nHongkongers"}]}
