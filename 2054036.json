While Hong Kong should have a high degree of autonomy in its domestic affairs, the Chinese Central government has time and time again undermined Hong Kong&rsquo;s legal system and parliamentary independence in Hong Kong. By also charging respected and peaceful pro-democracy politicians like Martin Lee and Margaret Ng, Beijing has made a mockery of the Rule of Law. As a student of the Law School, Mr. Koo would have made his Socratic judgement to support an authoritarian regime that have profoundly damaged so many families from the Tiananmen Massacre to concentration camps detaining Uyghurs.<br />\nMr. Sampson Koo appeared on local media yesterday in a protest outside the British Consulate in Hong Kong. While his associates were seen tearing up and vandalising their British passports, he also torn up an enlarged copy of the British Passport. At a time when British political parties are trying to sought out a &lsquo;Lifeboat policy for Hongkongers&rsquo;, Mr. Koo&rsquo;s actions and support at the protest causes great psychological discomfort. Also, a more shocking fact is that he is going to represent the International Community at the University of Reading in the coming academic year.<br />\n<br />\nLast weekend, over 300 young students were unnecessarily arrested in a single day by the Hong Kong Police. Numerous school girls in their school uniforms, completely unarmed and heading back to their first day of school after months of lockdown due to Covid-19; are taken away without any clear reasons. <br />\nMr Koo&rsquo;s stances does not objectively represent Hong Kong voice at the campus or could ever have represented the community of International Students objectively. The brutal killing of Mr. George Floyd in the United States is a shocking reminder of the damages that yields from police brutality. Wherever police brutality takes place, it cannot be supported. Certainly, with the Hong Kong Authority and the Chinese regime supporting police brutality and providing the equipment to enhance its brutality, neither can such authorities be supported. It is unbecoming to see Mr. Koo has decided to publicly back Authorities that many other students could neither agree nor support. His support will worsen police brutality and censorship in Hong Kong, causing more pain to the community of Hong Kong students.<br />\n<br />\nWhen one holds a sabbatical or representative position in a student union, representatives need to understand they are speaking up on behalf of the student body; particularly, in political gatherings. According to RUSU, an international student officer should adhere to the value to tie up with other students from similar backgrounds, share common experiences and receive advice and support from each other. I am disappointed and psychological hurt to find Mr. Koo has not shared the common values. While freedom of speech is a privilege, we should refrain from using it to cause harm. All lives matter.<br />\n<br />\nI am shocked and appalled by Mr. Koo&rsquo;s chosen action. I demand the student union for a statement, as well as tabling the motion to revoke his position within the SU governance body.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nYours

The Chinese government has time and time again undermined the legal system and parliamentary severity in Hong Kong. As a law student, he would have known it better than anyone else.<br />\nSampson Ho was seen in local newspaper yesterday for his participation in a protest outside of British embassy, in support of the national security law. Him and his associates were seen tearing their British passports up, which I firmly see as an insult to the proposal made by British government to open UK&rsquo;s door to many Hong Kong human rights activists, political refugees who are oppressed due to voicing their opinion. They have gained massive press exposure and appeared on multiple newspapers in Hong Kong and China; many have found out he is going to present University of Reading&rsquo;s student body next year. <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=0c78e73c\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&h=13b00484\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/</a> (furthest one on the right) <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjd.com.cn%2Fa%2F202005%2F29%2FWS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=a5006a24\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y</a><br />\nLast weekend, over 300 students were unnecessarily arrested in one day as a countermove of Hong Kong police force to peaceful protests, a lot the students were seen wearing their school uniforms, completely unarmed and did not appear to even be part of any protests, yet they were arrested and detained. <br />\nAs an international student myself, he has no place in representing me within or outwith the campus.

While Hong Kong should have a high degree of autonomy in its domestic affairs, the Chinese Central government has time and time again undermined Hong Kong&rsquo;s legal system and parliamentary independence in Hong Kong. By also charging respected and peaceful pro-democracy politicians like Martin Lee and Margaret Ng, Beijing has made a mockery of the Rule of Law. As a student of the Law School, Mr. Koo would have made his Socratic judgement to support an authoritarian regime that have profoundly damaged so many families from the Tiananmen Massacre to concentration camps detaining Uyghurs.<br />\nMr. Sampson Koo appeared on local media yesterday in a protest outside the British Consulate in Hong Kong. While his associates were seen tearing up and vandalising their British passports, he also torn up an enlarged copy of the British Passport. At a time when British political parties are trying to sought out a &lsquo;Lifeboat policy for Hongkongers&rsquo;, Mr. Koo&rsquo;s actions and support at the protest causes great psychological discomfort. Also, a more shocking fact is that he is going to represent the International Community at the University of Reading in the coming academic year.<br />\n<br />\nLast weekend, over 300 young students were unnecessarily arrested in a single day by the Hong Kong Police. Numerous school girls in their school uniforms, completely unarmed and heading back to their first day of school after months of lockdown due to Covid-19; are taken away without any clear reasons. <br />\nMr Koo&rsquo;s stances does not objectively represent Hong Kong voice at the campus or could ever have represented the community of International Students objectively. The brutal killing of Mr. George Floyd in the United States is a shocking reminder of the damages that yields from police brutality. Wherever police brutality takes place, it cannot be supported. Certainly, with the Hong Kong Authority and the Chinese regime supporting police brutality and providing the equipment to enhance its brutality, neither can such authorities be supported. It is unbecoming to see Mr. Koo has decided to publicly back Authorities that many other students could neither agree nor support. His support will worsen police brutality and censorship in Hong Kong, causing more pain to the community of Hong Kong students.<br />\n<br />\nWhen one holds a sabbatical or representative position in a student union, representatives need to understand they are speaking up on behalf of the student body; particularly, in political gatherings. According to RUSU, an international student officer should adhere to the value to tie up with other students from similar backgrounds, share common experiences and receive advice and support from each other. I am disappointed and psychological hurt to find Mr. Koo has not shared the common values. While freedom of speech is a privilege, we should refrain from using it to cause harm. All lives matter.<br />\n<br />\nI am shocked and appalled by Mr. Koo&rsquo;s chosen action. I demand the student union for a statement, as well as tabling the motion to revoke his position within the SU governance body.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nYours Sincerely,"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:36:32.000Z","msg":"唔好用all lives matter?<br />\n啲左膠見到會唔開心<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"821c79f1a61cb53590675fccebbb099cf23e8f1d","tid":2054036,"uid":173271,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:37:28.000Z","msg":"大英祖唔祖國都好<br />\n咁唔尊重就抵人收佢皮"},{"pid":"e6ddc63080c0d17d1ef3fdd9d45e4b44bba27dc8","tid":2054036,"uid":147941,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:38:22.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/knife.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/knife.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/knife.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5e106cdf91ee3319a8139085711fd0d1e8f04fff","tid":2054036,"uid":151313,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:38:42.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"dc40b00fbd3543bcc4627be2ba829d0816bfa860","tid":2054036,"uid":311921,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:39:23.000Z","msg":"屌 P牌仔推唔到<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />大家一齊幫佢番福建大學讀書"},{"pid":"04e88da13935bb2dfa86ee32a727a84d39bd3db9","tid":2054036,"uid":192957,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:42:40.000Z","msg":"Pushh"},{"pid":"1a686f8c580ba40a54613eb0e66392287c6468ee","tid":2054036,"uid":106336,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:42:49.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"dd88acb6a068e16b821e584cc75953e259278151","tid":2054036,"uid":157938,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:42:50.000Z","msg":"Yo"},{"pid":"b6b5d44c849c3ae658834765cae3ac56bd6b4869","tid":2054036,"uid":102547,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:43:14.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"3f3688290db92cd32d04cb1efab15d40fa3075ab","tid":2054036,"uid":92477,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:43:38.000Z","msg":"ed up"},{"pid":"445f18747fb4f5179b7bf011f6bc7141236fbea1","tid":2054036,"uid":157938,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"733f8b2a398bd516c03acf1dc69a9f378c0b0d16","tid":2054036,"uid":279363,"like":16,"dislike":0,"score":16,"quote":{"pid":"6fb8454af48df3eb63fd989325947a55c21bc544","tid":2054036,"uid":135759,"like":51,"dislike":1,"score":50,"quote":{"pid":"1f48fde1e296b8fbe15298d6ac4da0a17b7bbc99","tid":2054036,"uid":279363,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":5,"replyTime":"2020-06-06T21:27:42.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://lihkg.com/thread/2053702/page/1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lihkg.com/thread/2053702/page/1</a><br />\n右一果條友就係Reading 到讀law<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Dear Reading University Students' Union, <br />\nI am extremely hurt and disheartened by the scene of the newly elected international student officer - Sampson Ho, conducting such a move that signifies his stance against freedom of speech and democracy. <br />\nI am writing to complaint of his recent behaviour in supporting a Pro-national security law campaign in Hong Kong.

寫得詳細啲 希望樓主唔好介意<br />\n<br />\nDear Reading University Students' Union,<br />\nI am extremely disappointed and disheartened by the fact that the newly elected international student officer &ndash; Sampson Koo for his inappropriate behaviour and his stance against freedom of speech and democracy.<br />\nTherefore, I am writing to complain about his recent behaviour by supporting a Pro-Authoritarian Regime campaign in Hong Kong. While Hong Kong should have a high degree of autonomy in its domestic affairs, the Chinese Central government has time and time again undermined Hong Kong&rsquo;s legal system and parliamentary independence in Hong Kong. By also charging respected and peaceful pro-democracy politicians like Martin Lee and Margaret Ng, Beijing has made a mockery of the Rule of Law. As a student of the Law School, Mr. Koo would have made his Socratic judgement to support an authoritarian regime that have profoundly damaged so many families from the Tiananmen Massacre to concentration camps detaining Uyghurs.<br />\nMr. Sampson Koo appeared on local media yesterday in a protest outside the British Consulate in Hong Kong. While his associates were seen tearing up and vandalising their British passports, he also torn up an enlarged copy of the British Passport. At a time when British political parties are trying to sought out a &lsquo;Lifeboat policy for Hongkongers&rsquo;, Mr. Koo&rsquo;s actions and support at the protest causes great psychological discomfort. Also, a more shocking fact is that he is going to represent the International Community at the University of Reading in the coming academic year.<br />\n<br />\nLast weekend, over 300 young students were unnecessarily arrested in a single day by the Hong Kong Police. Numerous school girls in their school uniforms, completely unarmed and heading back to their first day of school after months of lockdown due to Covid-19; are taken away without any clear reasons. <br />\nMr Koo&rsquo;s stances does not objectively represent Hong Kong voice at the campus or could ever have represented the community of International Students objectively. The brutal killing of Mr. George Floyd in the United States is a shocking reminder of the damages that yields from police brutality. Wherever police brutality takes place, it cannot be supported. Certainly, with the Hong Kong Authority and the Chinese regime supporting police brutality and providing the equipment to enhance its brutality, neither can such authorities be supported. It is unbecoming to see Mr. Koo has decided to publicly back Authorities that many other students could neither agree nor support. His support will worsen police brutality and censorship in Hong Kong, causing more pain to the community of Hong Kong students.<br />\n<br />\nWhen one holds a sabbatical or representative position in a student union, representatives need to understand they are speaking up on behalf of the student body; particularly, in political gatherings. According to RUSU, an international student officer should adhere to the value to tie up with other students from similar backgrounds, share common experiences and receive advice and support from each other.

1 有Grammar/spelling mistakes, 跟version 2<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Dear Reading University Students' Union,<br />\n<br />\nI am extremely disheartened by the scene of the newly elected international student officer - Sampson Koo, conducting such a move that signifies his stance against freedom of speech and democracy.<br />\n<br />\nI am writing to complain about his recent behaviour in supporting a pro-national security law campaign in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has time and time again undermined the legal system and parliamentary sovereignty in Hong Kong. As a law student, he would have known it better than anyone else.<br />\n<br />\nSampson Koo was seen in the local newspaper yesterday for his participation in a protest outside of British embassy, in support of the national security law. He and his associates were seen tearing their British passports up, which I firmly see as an insult to the proposal made by the British government to open UK&rsquo;s door to many Hong Kong human rights activists, political refugees who are oppressed due to voicing their opinion. They have gained massive press exposure and appeared on multiple newspapers in Hong Kong and China; many have found out he is going to represent the University of Reading&rsquo;s student body next year.<br />\n<br />\n1. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=0c78e73c\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&h=13b00484\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/</a> <br />\n2. <a href=\"http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjd.com.cn%2Fa%2F202005%2F29%2FWS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=a5006a24\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLast weekend, over 300 students were unnecessarily arrested in one day as a countermove of Hong Kong police force to peaceful protests, a lot of the students were seen wearing their school uniforms, completely unarmed and did not appear to even be part of any protests, yet they were arrested and detained.<br />\n<br />\nAs an international student myself, he has no place in representing me within or outwith the campus. In light of the events in the U.S, I think we can all agree, any form of police brutality, wherever it takes place, should be stopped at once. It is unbecoming to see Sampson Koo has decided to publicly back a decision that many other students will not understand or agree, which will worsen police brutality and censorship in Hong Kong even further.<br />\n<br />\nWhen one holds a sabbatical or representative position in a student union, they need to understand they are speaking up on behalf of the student body, particularly, when in political gatherings.<br />\nI am shocked and appalled by his actions. I demand the student union for a statement of response, as well as revoking his post within the SU governance body.<br />\n<br />\nFreedom of speech is a privilege, and we should all protect it whilst we can.<br />\n<br />\nBest wishes,<br />\n<br />\nenquiries@rusu.co.uk<br />\ndiversityofficer@rusu.co.uk<br />\npresident@rusu.co.uk<br />\n<a

Students' Union, <br />\nI am extremely hurt and disheartened by the scene of the newly elected international student officer - Sampson Ho, conducting such a move that signifies his stance against freedom of speech and democracy. <br />\nI am writing to complaint of his recent behaviour in supporting a Pro-national security law campaign in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has time and time again undermined the legal system and parliamentary severity in Hong Kong. As a law student, he would have known it better than anyone else.<br />\nSampson Ho was seen in local newspaper yesterday for his participation in a protest outside of British embassy, in support of the national security law. Him and his associates were seen tearing their British passports up, which I firmly see as an insult to the proposal made by British government to open UK&rsquo;s door to many Hong Kong human rights activists, political refugees who are oppressed due to voicing their opinion. They have gained massive press exposure and appeared on multiple newspapers in Hong Kong and China; many have found out he is going to present University of Reading&rsquo;s student body next year. <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=0c78e73c\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&h=13b00484\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/</a> (furthest one on the right) <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjd.com.cn%2Fa%2F202005%2F29%2FWS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=a5006a24\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y</a><br />\nLast weekend, over 300 students were unnecessarily arrested in one day as a countermove of Hong Kong police force to peaceful protests, a lot the students were seen wearing their school uniforms, completely unarmed and did not appear to even be part of any protests, yet they were arrested and detained. <br />\nAs an international student myself, he has no place in representing me within or outwith the campus. In light of the events in the U.S, I think we can all agree any form of police brutality, wherever it takes place, should be stopped at once. It is unbecoming to see Sampson Ho has decided to publicly back a decision that many other students will not understand or agree, which will worsen policy brutality and censorship in Hong Kong even further. <br />\nWhen one holds a sabbatical or representative position in a student union, they need to understand they are speaking up on behalf of the student body, particularly, when in political gatherings. I am shocked and appalled by his action. I demand the student union for a statement of response, as well as revoking his post within the SU governance body. <br />\nFreedom of speech is a privilege, and we should all protect it whilst we can. <br />\n<br />\nBest wishes, <br />\n<br />\nenquiries@rusu.co.uk<br />\ndiversityofficer@rusu.co.uk<br />\npresident@rusu.co.uk<br />\n<a

The Chinese government has time and time again undermined the legal system and parliamentary severity in Hong Kong. As a law student, he would have known it better than anyone else.<br />\nSampson Ho was seen in local newspaper yesterday for his participation in a protest outside of British embassy, in support of the national security law. Him and his associates were seen tearing their British passports up, which I firmly see as an insult to the proposal made by British government to open UK&rsquo;s door to many Hong Kong human rights activists, political refugees who are oppressed due to voicing their opinion. They have gained massive press exposure and appeared on multiple newspapers in Hong Kong and China; many have found out he is going to present University of Reading&rsquo;s student body next year. <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=0c78e73c\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&h=13b00484\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/</a> (furthest one on the right) <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjd.com.cn%2Fa%2F202005%2F29%2FWS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=a5006a24\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y</a><br />\nLast weekend, over 300 students were unnecessarily arrested in one day as a countermove of Hong Kong police force to peaceful protests, a lot the students were seen wearing their school uniforms, completely unarmed and did not appear to even be part of any protests, yet they were arrested and detained. <br />\nAs an international student myself, he has no place in representing me within or outwith the campus.

Students' Union, <br />\nI am extremely hurt and disheartened by the scene of the newly elected international student officer - Sampson Ho, conducting such a move that signifies his stance against freedom of speech and democracy. <br />\nI am writing to complaint of his recent behaviour in supporting a Pro-national security law campaign in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has time and time again undermined the legal system and parliamentary severity in Hong Kong. As a law student, he would have known it better than anyone else.<br />\nSampson Ho was seen in local newspaper yesterday for his participation in a protest outside of British embassy, in support of the national security law. Him and his associates were seen tearing their British passports up, which I firmly see as an insult to the proposal made by British government to open UK&rsquo;s door to many Hong Kong human rights activists, political refugees who are oppressed due to voicing their opinion. They have gained massive press exposure and appeared on multiple newspapers in Hong Kong and China; many have found out he is going to present University of Reading&rsquo;s student body next year. <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=0c78e73c\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&h=13b00484\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/</a> (furthest one on the right) <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjd.com.cn%2Fa%2F202005%2F29%2FWS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=a5006a24\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y</a><br />\nLast weekend, over 300 students were unnecessarily arrested in one day as a countermove of Hong Kong police force to peaceful protests, a lot the students were seen wearing their school uniforms, completely unarmed and did not appear to even be part of any protests, yet they were arrested and detained. <br />\nAs an international student myself, he has no place in representing me within or outwith the campus. In light of the events in the U.S, I think we can all agree any form of police brutality, wherever it takes place, should be stopped at once. It is unbecoming to see Sampson Ho has decided to publicly back a decision that many other students will not understand or agree, which will worsen policy brutality and censorship in Hong Kong even further. <br />\nWhen one holds a sabbatical or representative position in a student union, they need to understand they are speaking up on behalf of the student body, particularly, when in political gatherings. I am shocked and appalled by his action. I demand the student union for a statement of response, as well as revoking his post within the SU governance body. <br />\nFreedom of speech is a privilege, and we should all protect it whilst we can. <br />\n<br />\nBest wishes, <br />\n<br />\nenquiries@rusu.co.uk<br />\ndiversityofficer@rusu.co.uk<br />\npresident@rusu.co.uk<br />\n<a

They have gained massive press exposure and appeared on multiple newspapers in Hong Kong and China; many have found out he is going to represent the University of Reading&rsquo;s student body next year.<br />\n<br />\n1. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=0c78e73c\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FCBE9HctpiQi%2F&h=13b00484\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE9HctpiQi/</a> <br />\n2. <a href=\"http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjd.com.cn%2Fa%2F202005%2F29%2FWS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=a5006a24\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202005/29/WS5ed0edffe4b00aba04d1f22f.html?fbclid=IwAR03Kpni5f2-HDcn6t5-5nZ4noC6w8JfxioZubJrMtcXzhau1qAX3ydwX9Y</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLast weekend, over 300 students were unnecessarily arrested in one day as a countermove of Hong Kong police force to peaceful protests, a lot of the students were seen wearing their school uniforms, completely unarmed and did not appear to even be part of any protests, yet they were arrested and detained.<br />\n<br />\nAs an international student myself, he has no place in representing me within or outwith the campus. In light of the events in the U.S, I think we can all agree, any form of police brutality, wherever it takes place, should be stopped at once. It is unbecoming to see Sampson Koo has decided to publicly back a decision that many other students will not understand or agree, which will worsen police brutality and censorship in Hong Kong even further.<br />\n<br />\nWhen one holds a sabbatical or representative position in a student union, they need to understand they are speaking up on behalf of the student body, particularly, when in political gatherings.<br />\nI am shocked and appalled by his actions. I demand the student union for a statement of response, as well as revoking his post within the SU governance body.<br />\n<br />\nFreedom of speech is a privilege, and we should all protect it whilst we can.<br />\n<br />\nBest wishes,<br />\n<br />\nenquiries@rusu.co.uk<br />\ndiversityofficer@rusu.co.uk<br />\npresident@rusu.co.uk<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theuniversityofreading/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheuniversityofreading%2F&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=4739205a\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/theuniversityofreading/</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RUSUnews/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRUSUnews%2F&d=gQ7zj4J1baFceLD6a1UzUn9Z9R%2B5WvgLevJIGZbvuGo%3D&h=0d1e23bf\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/RUSUnews/</a>"}}
