The claim has been fuelled by the attack on commuters, civilians and journalists at Yuen Long MTR station last July 21 by assailants later confirmed to have triad links. Some accused police of deliberately walking away from the scene and ignoring distress calls. Variations of the slogan reference the death of officers&rsquo; paternal and maternal families, as well as their fathers and mothers.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong police knowingly break the law <br />\n香港警察，知法犯法<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Hong Kong police knowingly break the law&rdquo; spotlights what protesters see as a lack of accountability among officers accused of committing illegal acts. The birth of the slogan would foreshadow months of conflict between the two sides, despite a 999-page watchdog report that largely cleared police of wrongdoing. Critics have highlighted that the Independent Police Complaints Commission lacks investigative powers and cannot summon witnesses.<br />\n<br />\nGood guys don&rsquo;t join the police; those who join the police go to hell 好仔唔當差，當差正仆街<br />\n<br />\nWith origins around the 1960s, the popular cry of &ldquo;Good guys don&rsquo;t join the police; those who join the police go to hell&rdquo; is largely self-explanatory."}]}
