It is a question made all the more difficult to answer by London&rsquo;s lack of a strategy for dealing with Beijing. The U.K. has not had such a strategy since George Osborne, chancellor of the exchequer at the time, declared a &ldquo;golden era&rdquo; of British&ndash;Sino relations on a trip to Beijing in 2015.

In Hong Kong, he was attached to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group whose task was to work with China to prepare for the transfer of government in 1997. In Beijing, during the 1990s, he focussed on China&rsquo;s increasingly active engagement in international relations. Later, in London, he participated in the establishment of full diplomatic relations between Britain and North Korea, while also engaged with regional and international partners in wider issues of regional security in North-East Asia.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://henryjacksonsociety.org/staff/matthew-henderson/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhenryjacksonsociety.org%2Fstaff%2Fmatthew-henderson%2F&d=eQX%2BqlmYp67lP1AM6ayufR5CyLKXDv55u35dva0wydI%3D&h=0fc255cb\" target=\"_blank\">https://henryjacksonsociety.org/staff/matthew-henderson/</a>"},{"pid":"e9bbcd951893347f675c0e098130c89ebdf75ae7","tid":1998398,"uid":203889,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-05-02T11:06:07.000Z","msg":"pushhh"},{"pid":"7c0de0bcd38ea203d6e40a002602810ffe61e82a","tid":1998398,"uid":95138,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-02T11:16:06.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"ce1d55bd287e5103bd45deb292df1e22de81ddf9","tid":1998398,"uid":306614,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-02T11:16:51.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"76e4784cd94408f7dda63326eebbf488d6944feb","tid":1998398,"uid":306614,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"e9bbcd951893347f675c0e098130c89ebdf75ae7","tid":1998398,"uid":203889,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-05-02T11:06:07.000Z","msg":"pushhh"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-02T11:18:46.000Z","msg":"and search Huawei UK on Twitter,  rt comment like tweets opposing Huawei"},{"pid":"5c9b004e21041a83f8ad833a68dbffa3a0a8f353","tid":1998398,"uid":53026,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-05-02T11:27:01.000Z","msg":"其實放棄極都放唔到係咪英國國策？定係首相問題？"},{"pid":"f04e6fa65a6db47920e9982cd8ed8edb5232cf56","tid":1998398,"uid":31185,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-02T11:28:05.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"5804870d785340edd8fb4b9fd4d19eba7867e28d","tid":1998398,"uid":118550,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"5c9b004e21041a83f8ad833a68dbffa3a0a8f353","tid":1998398,"uid":53026,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-05-02T11:27:01.000Z","msg":"其實放棄極都放唔到係咪英國國策？定係首相問題？"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-02T11:49:08.000Z","msg":"慣左倚靠中國囉"},{"pid":"7b3b4f60083358577febe8748d290e07968f14bd","tid":1998398,"uid":124983,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-02T11:50:14.000Z","msg":"收皮啦日落國<br />\n退休先黎講野<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/ass.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
