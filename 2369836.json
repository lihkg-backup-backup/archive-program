public-spirited people who were harassed and threatened.<br />\n<br />\nThis desperate suppression had a reason.<br />\n<br />\nChina needed to buy time.<br />\n<br />\nThis was because, in late 2019, the regime desperately needed to stop the imposition of more US sanctions which would cost the Chinese economy a further $1trillion.<br />\n<br />\nTo do this they needed a trade deal with America and it had to be agreed on December 15, 2019, and signed off by January 15, 2020.<br />\n<br />\nAny inkling that China had an out-of-control epidemic would have killed the deal &mdash; and inflicted great damage on its economy.<br />\n<br />\nWe now hear that the US intelligence agencies have very strong evidence that Covid started in the Wuhan biological labs.<br />\n<br />\nYesterday, the US produced a damning dossier which provided further evidence of scientists falling ill from the virus as early as autumn 2019."},{"pid":"a13b730e914c53d0412b3650dad0d51ea5669408","tid":2369836,"uid":152589,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-17T13:20:28.000Z","msg":"Lm binc"},{"pid":"a3e18e08d4de868ff0c8d102207cf442e5083c44","tid":2369836,"uid":281306,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-17T13:21:37.000Z","msg":"推<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n一圖整合FuckBook四大罪狀！！！！<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/2369722\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/2369722</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"1597181fb5b004e1dd8052ecf42a15a409aa4bd4","tid":2369836,"uid":158766,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-17T13:24:43.000Z","msg":"BinC"},{"pid":"79afb88ffb2baac3149aa488dbcccd891e7cb93e","tid":2369836,"uid":383344,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-17T13:24:54.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/26.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />呢篇嘢google 翻譯會唔會變成正義"},{"pid":"33f9291c2c26f506834fa23a0e2888b6d9f424af","tid":2369836,"uid":51820,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-17T13:27:06.000Z","msg":"推下先"},{"pid":"220a0e1018cae4813c01ec1e7c661dd1536a40fb","tid":2369836,"uid":249423,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-01-17T13:29:28.000Z","msg":"太陽報，睇定啲"},{"pid":"5625755a6bc5687503ee5c300cfce80a1ba3a3f4","tid":2369836,"uid":383344,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-17T13:29:56.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/LumonL6.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FLumonL6.png&h=254f84bf&s={SIZE}\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/999.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7baac59c1871d26cfdfdd8f7a581e86693357c4f","tid":2369836,"uid":238370,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"220a0e1018cae4813c01ec1e7c661dd1536a40fb","tid":2369836,"uid":249423,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-01-17T13:29:28.000Z","msg":"太陽報，睇定啲"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-17T13:31:41.000Z","msg":"英國最大報咁報，有利谷堆保守黨去抗中<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
