She has not been named. <br />\n<br />\nThe consul general, who takes part in triathlons, turned the student over, lifted her face clear of the water and swam backwards to the steep sided riverbank.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;She was unconscious, she was not breathing and for a short time we feared the worst. But as we got back to the side, she started breathing again,&quot; he told the BBC of the rescue, which took place on Saturday morning.<br />\n<br />\nThe diplomat held onto a lifebuoy attached to a rope that had been thrown towards him by passers-by, who then pulled the woman to safety. Mr Ellison swam round to shallower rocks and climbed out. He was given dry clothes and warm drinks by grateful villagers.<br />\n<br />\nHe said the student, who is from Wuhan and attends Chongqing University, was shaken by the experience and recovering slowly.<br />\n<br />\nBut she was extremely grateful and has invited him to dinner with her family next weekend.<br />\n<br />\nMr Ellison, originally from Newcastle, is head of the British mission in Chongqing - where his role is primarily to support bilateral trade links between Britain and China.<br />\n2px presentational grey line<br />\n'In China we call him a hero'<br />\n<br />\nKerry Allen - China media analyst<br />\n<br />\nRelations between China and the UK have been rapidly deteriorating over the past year, amid rows over Hong Kong, tech firm Huawei and the coronavirus.<br />\n<br />\nYet there's full praise online for Mr Ellison, with Chinese social media users calling him a &quot;hero&quot;, a &quot;role model&quot; and someone who is &quot;worthy of admiration&quot; for saving the student, who media said fell &quot;while taking pictures&quot;. He's being described as &quot;uncle&quot;, a term almost never used to describe foreigners.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;You'd call such a person a knight in the UK; in China we call him a hero,&quot; one user on the popular Sina Weibo site says.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;For such a big official to go into the water himself to save someone&hellip; you've got to like this,&quot; another wrote.<br />\n<br />\nFootage of the incident filmed on locals' phones has racked up more than a million views after it was posted online by popular media outlets Global Times and Pear Video. It's also got locals doing a bit of self-reflection on how they view foreigners.<br />\n<br />\nDespite recent negative feeling towards Britain, many Chinese say they're &quot;shocked&quot; that &quot;so many [local] people were watching, and not a single person rushed to the water themselves&quot; to help.<br />\n<br />\nSuch scenes are common in China - crowds of people standing watching a developing incident. Many fear that rushing to involve themselves could lead to their being implicated. Where this has happened previously, many have debated whether China has a &quot;morality&quot; issue.
