Inadmissible aliens</strong><br />\n(a) Classes of aliens ineligible for visas or admission<br />\nExcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, aliens who are inadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United States:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>(D) Immigrant membership in totalitarian party</strong><br />\n(i) In general<br />\n<span class=\"red\"><strong>Any immigrant who is or has been a member of or affiliated with the Communist or any other totalitarian party (or subdivision or affiliate thereof), domestic or foreign, is inadmissible.</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n但問題係出係exception到，首先如果申請人既共產黨員身份係<strong>出於非自願(involuntary)，或者16歲以下(under 16 years of age)，又或者為左生存必須而加入既(for purposes of obtaining employment, food rations, or other essentials of living and whether necessary for such purposes)</strong>，都會獲得豁免<br />\n<br />\n<strong>(ii) Exception for involuntary membership</strong><br />\n<br />\nClause (i) shall not apply to an alien because of membership or affiliation if the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer when applying for a visa (or to the satisfaction of the Attorney General when applying for admission) that <span class=\"red\">the membership or affiliation is or was involuntary, or is or was solely when under 16 years of age, by operation of law, or for purposes of obtaining employment, food rations, or other essentials of living and whether necessary for such purposes.</span><br />\n<br />\n所以班少先隊甚至大部分共青團既人，理論上係可以申請移民。<br />\n<br />\n而退黨又可唔可以申請移民呢?技術上係可以，但要同時岩2個條件︰<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. 申請前2年已退黨，但如果申請人係同共產黨有較親密既關係既，就需要5年<br />\n2. 需要經過審查，被認為唔係security threat先得</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>(iii) Exception for past membership</strong><br />\nClause (i) shall not apply to an alien because of membership or affiliation if the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer when applying for a visa (or to the satisfaction of the Attorney General when applying for admission) that-<br />\n<br />\n(I) the membership or affiliation terminated at least-<br />\n<span class=\"red\">(a) 2 years before the date of such application, or<br />\n(b) 5 years before the date of such application, in the case of an alien whose membership or affiliation was with the party controlling the government of a foreign state that is a totalitarian dictatorship as of such date, and</span><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"red\">(II) the alien is not a threat to the security of the United States.</span><br />\n<br />\n呢個<strong>重點係審查到</strong>，呢點可以鬆處理，但有心既話都可以留難，要睇返當時既政府對華態度係點先知，呢點算係模稜兩可。<br />\n<br />\n<strong>第三點係家庭團聚，呢點就無咩野好講</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>(iv) Exception for close family members</strong><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"red\">The Attorney General may, in the Attorney General's discretion, waive the application of clause (i) in the case of an immigrant who is the parent, spouse, son, daughter, brother, or sister of a citizen of the United States or a spouse, son, or daughter of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest if the immigrant is not a threat to the security of the United States.</span>"},{"pid":"6ea2fa02ea2207717a78fd6d0db35869771cd217","tid":2228538,"uid":295230,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-03T15:56:30.000Z","msg":"所以各位連仔唔好咁開心住，遲下兩國關係變好移民申請隨時又變返先前咁鬆<img
