There are a lot of twins and triplets in orphanages. The official reason is that parents cannot afford to raise 2 or 3 kids at same time. Some say that they represent a kind of magic for the Leaders and that the parents do not have the choice to keep them at home. I took a polaroid of the triplets and asked the orphanage director to give the picture to the parents, but I understood they were living very far away and that there were few chances they could receive the picture of their children.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16-59140b7b2021c__880.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.boredpanda.com%2Fblog%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F05%2F16-59140b7b2021c__880.jpg&h=603b17ab&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\nIn Pyongyang(平壤), I took the polaroids of the girls working at a restaurant, then the owner came and asked for one, in English!
