Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the bombardment, with many more injured or displaced. The assault has created the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, with more than 50,000 children dying of preventable causes. A recent UN report warned that if things continue as they are then by the end of this year 250,000 people will have died as a result of the war.<br />\n<br />\n2）協助軍火商賺大錢 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yeah.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\nThis is a war that has been armed and supported every step of the way by the UK government, which has licensed over &pound;5bn of military aircraft and bomb sales to Saudi Arabia since the war began. In a damning court of appeal verdict this morning, which followed a case brought by Campaign Against Arms Trade, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, Lord Justice Irwin and Lord Justice Singh concluded that the export licensing decisions were &ldquo;irrational and therefore unlawful&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\n3）協助基要主義王國鞏固政權 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/love.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\nOn the fourth anniversary of the war, the foreign secretary, and Tory leadership hopeful, Jeremy Hunt, claimed it would be &ldquo;morally bankrupt&rdquo; to stop selling arms to the Saudi regime. That same day, Saudi-led forces bombed a hospital killing eight people. Hunt&rsquo;s wording was particularly crass, but he was following the same disgraceful policies as his predecessor, and Tory rival, Boris Johnson, who in 2016 signed off on new bomb sales only two days after Saudi forces destroyed a food factory, killing 12 people.<br />\n<br />\n4）然後指責發展中國家沒有人權 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/donno.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/20/selling-arms-to-the-saudis-was-always-immoral-now-it-is-unlawful-too\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2019%2Fjun%2F20%2Fselling-arms-to-the-saudis-was-always-immoral-now-it-is-unlawful-too&d=hgakeblNVNpTjPSl%2FdBGDvFBXrQbHxe6tNmRytRnjp4%3D&h=03ee414e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/20/selling-arms-to-the-saudis-was-always-immoral-now-it-is-unlawful-too</a>"},{"pid":"36f7e3407b0d77e42a01599c2f598c5c762a5066","tid":1257718,"uid":35842,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-25T16:56:22.000Z","msg":"推<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/GJn1ce0.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FGJn1ce0.png&h=0aeb1555&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n//<br />\n<a href=\"https://t.me/seekforg20help\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fseekforg20help&d=hgakeblNVNpTjPSl%2FdBGDvFBXrQbHxe6tNmRytRnjp4%3D&h=96fea52f\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://t.me/seekforg20help</a><br />\n由於聽日步行路線比較複雜，所以我地會用呢個頻道keep住update遊行隊伍去到咩位置，方便想中途加入既人搵到我地。所以希望大家可以幫手share呢條Channel出去，感謝！<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">(懶既直接係最底copy) </span></div><br />\n//<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b22badc0ef9a5e6f5270001d35ce75264f24798b","tid":1257718,"uid":263174,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-25T16:58:48.000Z","msg":"雖然係好事，但英國都係食屎狗。相信好快佢又賣返。"},{"pid":"bc943d7f6a7d713b270d29896450bc94ebc408b7","tid":1257718,"uid":8116,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-25T17:00:42.000Z","msg":"英國有做野 好過冇做<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ea6a5b445e9c4e62008c16e10d7740c422323b21","tid":1257718,"uid":37699,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-25T17:04:50.000Z","msg":"It is not a good news. 如果改用強貨，催淚彈可能會變成⋯<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
