Earlier today, we saw a significant decline in the value of some key WSB stocks, such as GME and BB, shortly after market close. I would urge everyone to stay calm, as the VAST MAJORITY (~95%) of after-hours trading is conducted by institutional investors. The sudden share plunge is literally a way to scare us into selling in the morning, such that these institutional investors can limit their shorting losses.<br />\n<br />\nPlease be diligent. GME and BB to the fucking moon, kiddos. <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6kikt/why_you_should_not_let_the_ah_activity_scare_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Fl6kikt%2Fwhy_you_should_not_let_the_ah_activity_scare_you%2F%3Futm_source%3Dshare%26utm_medium%3Dios_app%26utm_name%3Diossmf&d=LvSu6Mc%2FVB7R449T953cUxlCv%2FutJLQSKuuf3SGwDjg%3D&h=4f3e4b71\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6kikt/why_you_should_not_let_the_ah_activity_scare_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a>"},{"pid":"83b76353e6879c9efb75445809163f73e6b0f92d","tid":2383498,"uid":100155,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-28T02:58:33.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4022ff65512d4f2bbcab5cfcf75554d89ae547f6","tid":2383498,"uid":100155,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-28T02:58:44.000Z","msg":"🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"},{"pid":"045588ff8dd7e16509312091c3b0ca3b126cb78c","tid":2383498,"uid":100155,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-28T02:59:24.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f9cfebd0817e9a48f766d2ff31a3908aba93af61","tid":2383498,"uid":100155,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-28T02:59:55.000Z","msg":"Short interest rate (249%) is as high as ever in Gamestop. By now you should also know that Melvin are getting around $3 billions in help/investment to bail them out. The battle has just started and the fact that the shorters refuse to back down is actually good news. In simple terms it means that when the short squeeze starts it will be a massive one. Dont be fooled by the media narrative which is controlled by shorters such as Melvin, Citron &amp; Co. The short squeeze has not even started yet. The whales are coming, the margin calls are coming, the shorts will soon liquidate and GME will fly into to the moon.
