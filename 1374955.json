Engel, Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, today made the following statement on the situation in Hong Kong:<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I am deeply concerned by the reports of police brutality in response to peaceful protests in Hong Kong and by the vigilante attacks on reporters in Yuen Long MTR Station. I urge all parties to exercise restraint and call on the Hong Kong Government to uphold its commitment to the rule of law. Allegations of police violence over the past weeks have tarnished Hong Kong&rsquo;s international reputation for good governance and the fair administration of justice.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Moreover, Beijing&rsquo;s increasingly harsh responses and propagandic depictions of &lsquo;radical protestors&rsquo; as ungrateful troublemakers egged on by &lsquo;foreign interference&rsquo; further sheds light on the Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s continued attempts to chip away at the freedoms and rights that make Hong Kong unique.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;These protests originated as a response to the problematic amendments proposed to Hong Kong&rsquo;s extradition law, but the sustained discontent is a clear reflection of a broader disconnect between the Hong Kong Government and the aspirations of its people. I hope the Chief Executive will take all steps to address these issues head-on.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"1288933221754fe3e823814564ef84a8d6eb1f51","tid":1374955,"uid":195904,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-28T02:36:30.000Z","msg":"唔識英文唔好開post"},{"pid":"d8ec4c0a17f1a0cde04116340eab31a682c891be","tid":1374955,"uid":200758,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-28T02:36:43.000Z","msg":"呢個係26/7嘅聲明，講緊上星期日元朗恐襲，唔係講緊琴日"},{"pid":"30c5ad40ffc0f790c5934a043f3f6a51de5ead58","tid":1374955,"uid":269052,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-28T02:36:47.000Z","msg":"唔係外交部，係國會外交事務委員會主席"},{"pid":"d7e106b5cab98831e464f94213ca045f97242c22","tid":1374955,"uid":195904,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-28T02:40:51.000Z","msg":"唔好推 樓主戇鳩仔"}]}
