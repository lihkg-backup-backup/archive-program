Meanwhile, she rejected the 4 other demands from protestors in Hong Kong. <br />\n<br />\nBelow are the 5 demands:<br />\n<br />\n1. Full withdrawal of the extradition bill❓❓❓<br />\n(Note: she just &lsquo;proposed&rsquo; to withdraw the Extradition Bill but not &lsquo;withdraw&rsquo; the bill, which means there is still a possibility that the bill could be passed under the rule of this government with such low credibility)<br />\n<br />\n2. A independent commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality❌<br />\nFrom June to September, the Hong Kong Police has used excessive force against protestors (which include using the so call &lsquo;less lethal&rsquo; weapons while not following the guidelines, carrying out unreasonable arrest, deliberately undermining the freedom of press, sexual harassment and physical abuse to arrested protestors, etc) <br />\nNevertheless, the current &lsquo;Independent Police Complaints Council&rsquo; (IPCC) is not an effective department to investigate into police misbehaviour and it has been infamous for its lax enforcement of investigation. Thus, an Independent Commission of Inquiry is extremely necessary to save Hongkongers from this humanitarian crisis<br />\n<br />\n3. Withdraw the use of the word &lsquo;riot&rsquo; in relation to protest❌<br />\n<br />\n4. The release of protestors and drop the charges against them❌<br />\n<br />\n5. The implementation of &lsquo;genuine universal suffrage&rsquo;❌<br />\n(This is stated in the Basic Law of Hong Kong. Currently, Hong Kong us under an absurd political environment where the Chief Executive is only selected by a small group of 1200 people and the Legislative Council of Hong Kong adopts the Functional Constituency which has introduced many pro-China councillors into the Council) <br />\n<br />\nHongkongers will NOT be satisfied with this. What we want are the above Five Demands. It is only with the above five demands that the humanitarian crisis currently in Hong Kong could be relieved.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFive Demands, Not One Less<br />\n(來自 [國際線][English][4-9-2019] Five Demands, Not One Less!!!<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1540646\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1540646</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"9821fe4b508f3edef2000109c8b6aac6296bd0db","tid":1541609,"uid":3457,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T15:29:34.000Z","msg":"佢地會介意咩？ <br />\n一個月八皮 又可以強姦人<br />\n唔怕做Condom"}]}
