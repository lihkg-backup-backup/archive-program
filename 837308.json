Here's how Washington can leverage that to its advantage<br />\n<br />\n(This first appeared in 2015.)<br />\n<br />\n...One of the first research-related steps is to identify the cohesive and centrifugal forces inside China. ...<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">The second is to develop, maintain and update a database of leadership dossiers (as well as their families) that includes points of leverage, such as overseas assets that could be frozen, as well as electronic and telephonic contact information.</span></strong> <br />\n<br />\nThe U.S. government is certainly as capable as Bloomberg and the New York Times of ferreting out this kind of information. <strong><span style=\"color: red;\">If the CCP is imploding, the tense situation will ensure that many cadres start thinking in terms of their personal and family welfare, rather than the party. When survival is at stake, the CCP&rsquo;s institutional cohesion is likely to falter as each looks after his own and looks to ensure there is an escape hatch.</span> In this kind of situation, the ability to influence Beijing&rsquo;s decisions will be highly personalized, and the ability to both contact and shape the incentives of individual decision makers in Zhongnanhai as well as provincial leaders and security officials could prove critical if Washington wants to shape outcomes.<br />\n</strong><br />\nThird, determining the capability of China&rsquo;s internal security forces, including domestic intelligence and paramilitary capabilities, is vital to understanding whether unrest is approaching a critical mass....<br />\n<br />\nFourth, U.S. policy makers and analysts need to map out the decisions Beijing will face as individual incidents of unrest begin to cascade into a larger crisis....<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Fifth, the U.S. government needs to find a way to maintain communication with the Chinese people, even if Beijing starts cutting international linkages. </strong><br />\n<br />\nThe Great Firewall may not be impervious and it will be difficult to shut down the Chinese internet , but China, as proved by its recent interference in virtual private networks (VPNs), can make it extremely difficult to move communications and information via the Internet. ..... the next best thing would be retaining the capacity to broadcast radio into China in an emergency.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">If Washington is concerned that the CCP is approaching its twilight, then asserting a moral stake in China&rsquo;s development requires nothing less than a substantial effort to understand China&rsquo;s political landscape beyond day-to-day policy-making concerns and [red]to influence Chinese leaders before they pull the trigger on their citizens again.<br />\n</span></strong><br />\nWithout advance preparation, U.S. and other international leaders will find the prospects of an unstable China distressing, possibly with the view that it is &ldquo;too big to fail.&rdquo; They may even watch from the sidelines as in 1989, not knowing the best course of action or how to influence the decisions of Chinese leaders. This may not be wrong, but such a momentous decision should not be left to ignorance, preexisting mental images or scattered information collected as a crisis breaks.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/are-we-ready-if-china-suddenly-collapsed-27652\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnationalinterest.org%2Fblog%2Fbuzz%2Fare-we-ready-if-china-suddenly-collapsed-27652&d=1x%2BWbh8gi2e5EyRCu49XCPM6KyiA14vjm6WlJCMZo68%3D&h=f897fd61\" target=\"_blank\">https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/are-we-ready-if-china-suddenly-collapsed-27652</a><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"bad84f92502ebb76eeb5dce9221d50ff962269a7","tid":837308,"uid":48083,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-26T09:36:35.000Z","msg":"發覺哩條友舊文預言咗好多今日美國對中國既政策..<br />\n如果強國醒少少, 見mad dog上位就應該揾人研究吓佢<img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nStop Saying China Is at a Crossroads<br />\n&quot;Pretending that Beijing&rsquo;s options remain perpetually open is to ignore what Chinese leaders have and have not done for the good and ill of their country.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n...Perhaps the most damaging decision Beijing has made, at least from the perspective of U.S. interests, is reneging on the intellectual property rights commitments it made as part of its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
