Her footage is conveniently edited to skip Abe doing the same thing.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">IN fact, Abe dumped his entire box of fish food into the pond and Trump followed while the Prime Minister of Japan smiled.</span> However, the anti-Trump media has been cropping the video to only show Trump&rsquo;s actions.<br />\n<br />\nBuzzFeed News ran a story headlined, &ldquo;This photo of Trump dumping his carp food in a pond in japan has become a huge meme,&rdquo; and embedded a series of Japanese tweets mocking the president. The Guardian even ran a story about the dangers of overfeeding fish. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;White House reporters, keen perhaps to pick up on a Trump gaffe, captured the moment when he upended his box on their smartphones and tweeted evidence of his questionable grasp of fish keeping,&rdquo; The Guardian wrote. &ldquo;Some speculated that a poor palace employee would be dispatched to the scene to clean up the mess as soon as the two leaders disappeared inside.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nForeign dignitaries have been feeding the fish in the koi pond for years, but Trump did not lose patience, despite what the media wants the narrative to be. He was literally emulating Abe with his actions.<br />\n<br />\nOne Twitter user wrote, &ldquo;Abe is basically watching in polite rage-horror as the epic orange buffoon tries to kill his fish,&rdquo; but she clearly didn&rsquo;t see the entire video, while the New York Daily News said, &ldquo;The former New York City real estate tycoon got a little heavy handed while feeding koi.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/06/anti-trump-media-makes-up-fake-story-about-overfeeding-fish-at-japanese-koi-pond.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fentertainment%2F2017%2F11%2F06%2Fanti-trump-media-makes-up-fake-story-about-overfeeding-fish-at-japanese-koi-pond.html&d=%2B8t1zD76Akrb5gSLLcVgAjACEZ5EYDiH2DLr%2FNuFFp4%3D&h=2657498c\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fentertainment%2F2017%2F11%2F06%2Fanti-trump-media-makes-up-fake-story-about-overfeeding-fish-at-japanese-koi-pond.html&h=29f27b11\" target=\"_blank\">www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/06/anti-trump-media-makes-up-fake-story-about-overfeeding-fish-at-japanese-koi-pond.html</a>"},{"pid":"68ae1f9bc0a14751da67c70ca2523f9f6c2d88f7","tid":461559,"uid":109462,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-07T16:50:40.000Z","msg":"完整經過：<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yAaFzb0sG3s\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FyAaFzb0sG3s&d=%2B8t1zD76Akrb5gSLLcVgAjACEZ5EYDiH2DLr%2FNuFFp4%3D&h=242fd96d\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/yAaFzb0sG3s</a>"},{"pid":"e460b1801cbb8d017abce0f66387f4e6a1148ba1","tid":461559,"uid":20816,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-07T16:56:40.000Z","msg":"[haters mode] 佢翻轉個盒黎倒，安倍係拋出去嘅，侮辱錦鯉食盒面反盒底［/haters mode]"},{"pid":"8219c7288dde94cce2687a3bc2ee7cac65be263b","tid":461559,"uid":31125,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-07T17:05:34.000Z","msg":"而家美國好多所謂comedian 媒體日日都搵trump黎講<br />\n根本trump 自佢參選以黎就係呢班粉腸既大財路 寫既 睇既都樂此不疲 日日唔洗搵料就有近聞"},{"pid":"4c920322443e749e4ef1319d9c012e1c8a9fba2d","tid":461559,"uid":37666,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-07T20:11:01.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>[haters mode] 佢翻轉個盒黎倒，安倍係拋出去嘅，侮辱錦鯉食盒面反盒底［/haters mode]</blockquote><br />\n原來你就係CNN"}]}
