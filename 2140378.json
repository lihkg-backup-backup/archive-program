The company tells The Verge that there are no talks at present to acquire TikTok, and it has no plans to pursue such a deal.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nNotably, Axios sourced the information to figures outside of Apple, who reportedly had knowledge of ongoing talks.<br />\n<br />\nMicrosoft announced on Sunday that it was in talks to buy TikTok&rsquo;s operations in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, as guided by President Trump. There has been heated speculation about other potential buyers for the app in the days since. Axios also said there was significant private equity interest in the purchase, and Microsoft has stated it would be open to minority investors as part of the deal.<br />\n<br />\nSuch a deal would be unusual for Apple, which has been broadly critical of targeted advertising, a practice at the center of TikTok&rsquo;s business. At the same time, Microsoft has tried a number of times to launch competitors to Facebook and YouTube, and some have argued that a TikTok acquisition would give the company the foothold it needs in social networking."},{"pid":"c1cae0cef16662e46044ab693b3f0d06175513cf","tid":2140378,"uid":1121,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-05T03:21:14.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/8/4/21354082/apple-tiktok-acquisition-denial-targeted-ads-bytedance?__twitter_impression=true\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fplatform%2Famp%2F2020%2F8%2F4%2F21354082%2Fapple-tiktok-acquisition-denial-targeted-ads-bytedance%3F__twitter_impression%3Dtrue&d=Iz1eZ%2FSDqTYQUikxH7ZearO6ciNacqKxYXGqE8pVUEM%3D&h=74f9edae\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/8/4/21354082/apple-tiktok-acquisition-denial-targeted-ads-bytedance?__twitter_impression=true</a>"},{"pid":"10c48dca2ad309cbec551d5aa407ef81a9884903","tid":2140378,"uid":4646,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-05T03:48:22.000Z","msg":"Windows 用家可以用tiktok<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"888ef606aa3c0172b55abe37c2b9da6dadec81c7","tid":2140378,"uid":105678,"like":5,"dislike":1,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-05T03:51:17.000Z","msg":"用戶形象太柒，外國好多人臭抖音畀弱智用，apple好睇重品牌印象"},{"pid":"9359e5cb67b0c84bde99b41c92cf44d288394a5d","tid":2140378,"uid":109923,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-05T05:17:40.000Z","msg":"[中國又贏]上海「小i機器人」控告「蘋果Siri」侵權，索償100億人民幣，中國高院認定中國專利有效<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/2139914\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/2139914</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<br />\n蘋果已經俾中共搞緊啦喎，佢敢買tiktok咪即係打對台<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6adc46cc3d1b461f8bf7c7406d7fdbfc09d505f0","tid":2140378,"uid":301989,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"10c48dca2ad309cbec551d5aa407ef81a9884903","tid":2140378,"uid":4646,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-05T03:48:22.000Z","msg":"Windows 用家可以用tiktok<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-05T05:34:03.000Z","msg":"支持windows遲啲內置tiktok<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
