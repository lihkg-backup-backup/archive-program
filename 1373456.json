The protesters opposed against the Triads beating ordinary citizens in the Metro Station on the 21st July, and accused police of their indifference and non-action of this incident despite receiving thousands of emergency calls in 3 hours. <br />\n<br />\nIn this protest, the Police employed brutality towards unarmed peaceful protesters and ordinary citizens. This included firing tear gas to residential buildings, Metro Stations and elderly homes. More importantly, in the evening, hundreds of police entered the MTR station and used brutal force to beat the heads of unarmed peaceful ordinary citizens. Some were injured with blood. Some became unconscious. <br />\n<br />\nThe Police&rsquo;s brutality and vigilante attacks reminded the people of Hong Kong the violence of the Triads on last weekend. The Police had lost their temperament. Not only are they no longer able to protect the lives of Hong Kong citizens, but also become the Triad members themselves to beat us.<br />\n<br />\nI hope you understand that it is difficult to provide sufficient evidence due to the chaotic situation at the scene and the Police prohibiting reporters from filming their actions. Yet, please refer to the attached GIF for your follow-up actions. Thank you.<br />\n<br />\nYours faithfully,<br />\n<br />\n最後希望大家attach埋以下野做證據：<br />\n1. <img src=\"https://s1.ezgif.com/save/ezgif-1-90f04f850673.gif\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fs1.ezgif.com%2Fsave%2Fezgif-1-90f04f850673.gif&h=3da870dc&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n2. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/350460870\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F350460870&d=%2FFjBtsZQ5cEfgjMY%2Bqoz3h21egSez4RG9A7txFtatZY%3D&h=992342a1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://vimeo.com/350460870</a>    727 警察射tg去民居<br />\n<br />\n3. <a href=\"https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/2019/7/engel-statement-on-hong-kong\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fforeignaffairs.house.gov%2F2019%2F7%2Fengel-statement-on-hong-kong&d=%2FFjBtsZQ5cEfgjMY%2Bqoz3h21egSez4RG9A7txFtatZY%3D&h=6eda7c1b\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/2019/7/engel-statement-on-hong-kong</a>  美國國會聲明"},{"pid":"d7d1e26916ba8919570e6290bca909b3ad19d87b","tid":1373456,"uid":97944,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-27T15:33:00.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ArmChannelTV/videos/381362682521959/UzpfSTcwNTU2ODExMzoxMDE1NzQ0OTczNzk4MzExNA/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FArmChannelTV%2Fvideos%2F381362682521959%2FUzpfSTcwNTU2ODExMzoxMDE1NzQ0OTczNzk4MzExNA%2F&d=%2FFjBtsZQ5cEfgjMY%2Bqoz3h21egSez4RG9A7txFtatZY%3D&h=a215f483\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/ArmChannelTV/videos/381362682521959/UzpfSTcwNTU2ODExMzoxMDE1NzQ0OTczNzk4MzExNA/</a><br />\n<br />\n短片清楚顯示「速龍」突然快速衝入西鐵站突襲"}]}
