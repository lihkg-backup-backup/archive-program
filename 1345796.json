While those gangsters bet the protestors with those powerful and killing weapons recklessly, it is discovered that Solicitor Ho appeared at the scene and showed his support to this unlawful and violent action. Not only did he appeared himself, but he also expressed his opinion, that he would allow those gangs to &ldquo;kill&rdquo; the peaceful protestors in their own will, until they are all cleared. What&rsquo;s more, in his earlier videos can we found that he persuaded the citizens to launch a mass killing campaign on those anti-government citizens. This was particularly ridiculous, especially from the mouth of a Lawyer and even a Legislative Council Member.<br />\n<br />\nIt is often believed that being a practitioner in law, he or she should particularly understand the importance of justice and also the rule of law, because they are always be regarded as the protector of rule of law in Hong Kong, our beloved home.

Instead, he chose to encourage such violence action, which harmed the personal safety and human rights of Hong Kong citizens. His action, even more, deeply harmed the security in Hong Kong, which greatly undermined the rule of law and the reputation of Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nIn view of this, may I request your emphasis in this case.
