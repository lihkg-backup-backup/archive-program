The actor was featured on posters to sell Daydi (Rogue), but makes no appearance in the final product.<br />\n<br />\nThe poster appeared to lift images of the actor from the promotional materials for the 2015 film&nbsp;Last Knights. The licensers accused production studio Timur Film of breaching consumers&rsquo; rights by falsely promising an appearance from the A-lister. Timur Film has yet to comment.<br />\n<br />\nThe film does feature Uzbek star Mirolim Quilchev as a police officer defending his country from a gang of assassins. Whether it will be granted release eventually rests on the verdicts of two other government bodies.<br />\n<br />\nCinema in the country is currently prolific yet uncelebrated. Studios churn out dozens of films each year, with few gaining international release.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://holland.pk/xdslrhva\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fholland.pk%2Fxdslrhva&h=4c399692&s={SIZE}\" />"}]}
