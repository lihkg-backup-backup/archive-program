It's about the extradition law protest today on 12/6, we, the Hong Kong people really need you guys to help voice out.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the protest today, the Hong Kong police's actions were outrageous, they deliberately shot at the protestors and even attacked them without giving any notice beforehand.

The poor driver fall instantly into a coma and his heart even stopped once. According to the guideline for the police, they should by aiming for just the lower body parts when it is necessary for them to use such degree of coercion (which is also clearly not the case here, but they did it anyway), yet what happened today was that they aimed for the heads of the protestors without considering the consequences of doing so, they were just treating it as a PUBG game, and it is definitely not acceptable. Some of them even clapped after firing tear gas into the crowd and celebrated by taking group photos afterwards.<br />\n<br />\nAs recognized by most parts of the world, protests in Hong Kong is always peaceful, of course, there will be conflicts during the protest, but we, the Hong Kong people always try to resolve things peacefully. However, today, once again, the Hong Kong police used an excessive degree of coercion to the citizens, the very group of people they should be protecting. Sadly, there's nothing that we can do about it ourselves, I just hope that you guys can take some times to read this very short passages and share it to your friends, everyone of you counts and your support to us would be very important in helping us to keep Hong Kong a city of rule of law, one that is loved by everyone of us.
