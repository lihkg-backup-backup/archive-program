Ho was told that he would never again be admitted to any program offered by the university, according to the announcement.<br />\n<br />\nThe university declined to comment on matters related to individual students, citing privacy concerns. The school had previously expelled students who violated rules or broke the law, according to its emailed statement. The school&rsquo;s disciplinary committee made its decisions after hearing from the involved students and considering all the available information, it said.<br />\n<br />\nIn September, the student union posted material on the bulletin board to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the so-called Umbrella Movement, a demonstration against China&rsquo;s increased political influence in the city. PolyU&rsquo;s management ordered the content to be removed, which the union protested. Internal investigations against the students were subsequently launched.<br />\n<br />\nProtests, and punishments of protesters, have become common on Hong Kong campuses since the 2014 Umbrella Movement, in which the city&rsquo;s students played a big role. Hong Kong Baptist University suspended two students last year after they complained about a compulsory Mandarin exam."},{"pid":"19cae1fdcd231fdd48a81692926ddf3e8bf6cdc9","tid":1044248,"uid":89530,"like":47,"dislike":1,"score":46,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-03-02T18:47:35.000Z","msg":"中國好成功令香港國際地位下降<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n97之後，所有引而為傲嘅嘢都冇撚晒，美國實對香港出手"},{"pid":"a14f007e765c03e211416d04f5d57210647d8218","tid":1044248,"uid":3122,"like":2,"dislike":2,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-03-02T18:48:24.000Z","msg":"上左都係咁"},{"pid":"da1eb548bc9d3670d5b2b53b2c111a4a9054077e","tid":1044248,"uid":136186,"like":28,"dislike":3,"score":25,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-03-02T18:53:54.000Z","msg":"啱啦 俾全世界人知道香港啲大學有幾咁醜陋"},{"pid":"d73afd23dbd1fb7cfd67c31aa82f59fd4bb2b542","tid":1044248,"uid":17286,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-03-02T20:17:27.000Z","msg":"肆無忌彈"},{"pid":"36b101cf4860b756e70344e296120f592ab7492d","tid":1044248,"uid":24730,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-03-02T21:00:43.000Z","msg":"關sir 加油<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"62fce38d53103b0e2762894b9292cb775ae0b453","tid":1044248,"uid":105166,"like":0,"dislike":11,"score":-11,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-03-02T21:15:51.000Z","msg":"嘩屌 勁呀<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/@.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/@.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n之前關Sir都上咗Time，我都勸佢唔讀書好過啦，已經好威㗎啦，擺落CV嚇死人，佢都開咗post打咗幾日飛機"},{"pid":"39b451f1ae46fbf060e4cb8127802091d8faec00","tid":1044248,"uid":36901,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-03-02T22:55:57.000Z","msg":"遲下廢香港關係法<br />\n禁香港大學生到美國留學<br />\n一定入撚晒呢班仆街共狗數<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b9fc5f729b087eaed878be1375e4ebbc00d2249a","tid":1044248,"uid":132038,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-03-03T00:08:33.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"722503c25dd301bf812d43385ea425d8896f330b","tid":1044248,"uid":143499,"like":3,"dislike":2,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-03-03T03:25:06.000Z","msg":"呢單嘢關sir唔發起行動，我哋根本冇嘢可以做<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n雖然我覺得連儂牆個概念好白痴不過因咁小事踢佢出校肯定係有政治目的"}]}
