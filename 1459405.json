The turning point leading to a massive amount of users leaving the forum was when they decided to block access of third party clients from accessing their service, in order to monopolize their official app. Users felt like they had enough, LIHKG was born, an exodus happened. It's sort of like when Digg users moved to Reddit back in 2010. This place has since become the largest message board in Hong Kong, getting spotlight from mainstream media. <br />\n<br />\nI think that apart from historical reason, the success of LIHKG is contributed by 1. its modern and progressive design compared to competitors, 2. admins lenience towards users and their commitment to protect them, and 3. the dominant youth userbase. Ideas are fresh and creative. The shitposts are hilarious.

Recognised ISP address only, which is the most important feature in my opinion. It makes lihkg exclusive to only Hong Kong people, which also means that it&rsquo;s a lot harder for users from China to register accounts and spread messages or false info from China. It also sort of limits users to abuse discussions by registering multiple accounts, at least relatively harder. <br />\n<br />\n2. Servers base overseas, it&rsquo;s known that lihkg&rsquo;s servers aren&rsquo;t based in Hong Kong which means it avoids many legal challenges for political reasons and users&rsquo; privacy will be protected <br />\n<br />\n3. Irreversible comments, once you posted a comment or a thread, you can do nothing about editing or deleting the post. Which means users are relatively higher responsible for what they post instead of editing or deleting the post anytime they regret. <br />\n<br />\n4. Voting system, it&rsquo;s common for any other forum but the one here it plays an important role as a public opinion poll and clearly it directly leads all the movements in these two months. The benefits of the voting system was debatable before the last app update because it could be just some delusions for the herds, it could be misleading and dangerous especially for a collectivist city like Hongkong <br />\n<br />\n5. Influential anonymity in a society, the influence of lihkg comes with its popularity in Hongkong among at least 2 generations, on the other hand the strong protection of users privacy by lihkg makes a perfect atmosphere for the users to discuss and to vote anonymously, and it is certainly a great reason for the user to love it when people can get involved or be influential to the society with their true self disregarding any social norms or any moral burden as they are anonymous. And I believe this is the main reason why lihkg is full of right wings as it is many people&rsquo;s id, but the superego of many people tell them that the concept of left wing is kinder.<br />\n<br />\nLastly, welcome to lihkg, thank you for trying to understand Hong Kongese culture."},{"pid":"a1774628c0073549d33ee503e809a89eb82d50f5","tid":1459405,"uid":261913,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-12T18:43:12.000Z","msg":"In here, no photo no talk.<br />\nOtherwise you could say you are Kate Upton.

Serious discussions in Hong Kong Golden forum that time about protest. I believe that time HKG forum only got around 10,000 members. That said, with 10'000 ppl united and put things in action, it very well could succeed. <br />\n<br />\nAfter 2003, HKG forum kept growing as the social media leader or voice of protest  in HK,including fund raising on newspaper ad, 64 gathering, onward 71 protest and mutli e-mail to US government etc. <br />\n<br />\nThree yrs ago, mobile app changed a lot of things, including HKG. HKG slow to launch a useable app and ppl change to use lihkg, then everything is history. <br />\n<br />\nAll told, HK ppl all long know the power of public forum and know how to use public forum to organize protest well since 2003.
