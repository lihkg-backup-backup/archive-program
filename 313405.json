Spokesman Lu Kang said that the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration was a &ldquo;historical document that no longer has any realistic meaning.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nNo, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the Brits can take back Hong Kong, much as some of the city&rsquo;s residents might wish that were possible. Instead it&rsquo;s a sign that China intends to renege on its promise in the treaty, registered at the United Nations, to give the territory &ldquo;a high degree of autonomy.&rdquo; The local government foreshadowed this decision last year when it made a subtle change to its website. It altered the slogan &ldquo;Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong,&rdquo; coined by Deng Xiaoping, to &ldquo;Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nIn a 2014 white paper denying Hong Kong democracy, the Chinese State Council asserted that certain promises in the Joint Declaration were not binding as international law on grounds that Beijing wrote them. Since China was the author, Beijing is therefore free to change the terms or declare them to be no longer valid. By that logic, all treaties China signs are meaningless because China will be a party to their language. It&rsquo;s hard to see why any government would conclude a treaty with Beijing when it views such agreements as binding only as long as they are expedient.<br />\n<br />\nChinese leaders have long memories and they bear a historical grudge against the treaties that Western nations imposed on a weak China in the late 19th century. But China&rsquo;s response more than a century later is to impose its own version of diplomatic blackmail on weaker nations, as it is attempting to do in the South China Sea. Only Japan&rsquo;s resistance is preventing something similar in the East China Sea.<br />\n<br />\nBritain is too afraid of China, or too concerned for its commercial interests, to protest violations of the Joint Declaration and stick up for the citizens of its former territory. But the self-governing citizens of Taiwan will surely notice how Beijing has disavowed the autonomy promised to Hong Kong and dishonored the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; formula that Deng once offered as a model for Taiwan&rsquo;s eventual return to the motherland.<br />\n<br />\nAs their double game with the U.S. over North Korea shows (see nearby), China&rsquo;s current leaders put regional dominance above global order. The growing evidence is that treaties and other diplomatic promises are disposable means to that end.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-discards-a-treaty-with-britain-1499188479\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fchina-discards-a-treaty-with-britain-1499188479&d=1L4Wam1K4R2RMB0Nmhry%2B8KJ7zzy8RXHrd%2FDXtMH0Y8%3D&h=dc2e498c\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-discards-a-treaty-with-britain-1499188479</a>"},{"pid":"a890b559e849162249f3a83ba82b33968e690ebf","tid":313405,"uid":79563,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-09T06:27:02.000Z","msg":"滿清桂良上身！<br />\n一百年都係無改進！<br />\n<br />\n負責與英法聯軍談判的桂良上奏咸豐皇帝：「此時英、佛兩國和約，萬不可作為真憑實據，不過假此數紙，暫且退卻海口兵船。將來倘欲背盟棄好，只須將奴才等治以辦理不善之罪，即可作為廢紙。」"},{"pid":"6d7b243c89ea9651d882ae655272dc96080a5383","tid":313405,"uid":167548,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-21T17:31:14.000Z","msg":"支那仆街啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />個主播應該會被消失<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
