That is also true in six other states. Thirty-one states only require your own signature while only three states require that the document be notarized...<br />\n<br />\n...And then there is the issue of how the election commissions in the states will be overwhelmed by tens of thousands of mail-in ballots that they might be receiving in November. That overload would minimize whatever manual checking of names, addresses and social security numbers might otherwise take place.<br />\n<br />\n....Add into the witch&rsquo;s cauldron the continued use of easily hacked antiquated voting machines as well as confusing ballots in many districts, and the question of whether an election can even be run with expectations of a credible result becomes paramount. President Trump has several times claimed that the expected surge in mail-in voting could result in &ldquo;the most corrupt vote in our nation&rsquo;s history.&rdquo; Trump is often wrong when he speaks or tweets spontaneously, but this time he just might be right.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/voting-fraud-real-electoral-system-vulnerable\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zerohedge.com%2Fgeopolitical%2Fvoting-fraud-real-electoral-system-vulnerable&d=ACvVw7CXGjn4pyDVYlJlLDrpXFO54mr1mpDNnesGdkc%3D&h=7d8f6dc7\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/voting-fraud-real-electoral-system-vulnerable</a>"},{"pid":"abc1505ea20f29531506bb149dda7f320bad57c2","tid":2143149,"uid":221211,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-07T02:41:34.000Z","msg":"如果用 blockchain 投票呢"},{"pid":"b477b9bb78467a741f3c0cc4a5a741c3367c0188","tid":2143149,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"abc1505ea20f29531506bb149dda7f320bad57c2","tid":2143149,"uid":221211,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-07T02:41:34.000Z","msg":"如果用 blockchain 投票呢"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-07T02:42:23.000Z","msg":"冇量子電腦既話應該好安全<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"66db76a1107d6bb2e2f5a0adfabc61b1e27b581d","tid":2143149,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-07T02:42:36.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/turcotte_jpt/status/1291331059414716416?s=21\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fturcotte_jpt%2Fstatus%2F1291331059414716416%3Fs%3D21&d=ACvVw7CXGjn4pyDVYlJlLDrpXFO54mr1mpDNnesGdkc%3D&h=1ae3af47\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fturcotte_jpt%2Fstatus%2F1291331059414716416%3Fs%3D21&h=53a37cf6\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/turcotte_jpt/status/1291331059414716416?s=21</a>"}]}
