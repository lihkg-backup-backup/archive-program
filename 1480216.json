British National Overseas citizens are the only few nationalities with no right of abode in their own country.<br />\n<br />\nAs you may see on the news, China has breached the Sino-British Joint Declaration repeatedly, putting the lives of Hong Kong people at risk. We have no choice but to suffer under the Chinese rule.<br />\n<br />\nWe (British National Overseas citizens) are quality British. We can make Britain great again with the following facts:<br />\n1. Hong Kong people are highly educated. The majority of the young people received tertiary education. <br />\n2. GDP per capital of Hong Kong is comparable to that of UK, which ranks 15th in the world according to the International Monetary Fund (2018).<br />\n3. The average Hongkonger owns USD$245,000, which ranks 14th in the world according to the Global Wealth Report 2018 published by the Credit Suisse Research Institute.<br />\n4. Hong Kong people share common value with British.<br />\n5. Hong Kong people are pragmatic and industrious. We want to contribute to the British society, and we are willing to assimilate.<br />\n6. We respect the rule of law because this is the intrinsic value taught by the British before 1997.<br />\n<br />\nAs Tom Tugendhat (MP) put forward: &ldquo;The UK had obligations to Hong Kong citizens before 1997, and the extension of overseas citizenship, which is in many ways a second-tier citizenship, was a mistake, and I think it&rsquo;s one that should be corrected. At a time when there are clearly tensions in Hong Kong, the UK could reassure many Hong Kong citizens that their existing rights are recognised by the UK, and they are valued.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nPlease help Hong Kong by signing this petition:<br />\n<a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/244402\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpetition.parliament.uk%2Fpetitions%2F244402&d=9fV5YN%2BdLeg0vJDpI0pnmrHzcpgs3fvoPbc8izSauP4%3D&h=f3e4c0c8\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/244402</a><br />\n<br />\nYou help is much appreciated.<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks,<br />\nBritish National Overseas citizens"},{"pid":"f734d604a531037ceec4fefd540d5bea31498389","tid":1480216,"uid":40250,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-20T12:37:41.000Z","msg":"開離岸用BNO/BC"},{"pid":"2e7a0d53f203417e7a918d0004311f63d1ad1bc7","tid":1480216,"uid":46042,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-20T12:38:55.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bomb.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"043ff9c53d564016c01be13910bddddb1af9d0cc","tid":1480216,"uid":40250,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"2e7a0d53f203417e7a918d0004311f63d1ad1bc7","tid":1480216,"uid":46042,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-20T12:38:55.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bomb.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-20T12:40:54.000Z","msg":"英國國民既戶口，中國無權要求涷結"},{"pid":"0a5653e6c5e6d9dc48e6907cec2cb02b6588f85d","tid":1480216,"uid":263618,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-20T12:56:34.000Z","msg":"bno係咪一定開到響匯豐？？"}]}
