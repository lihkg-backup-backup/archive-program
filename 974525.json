One reason for this is the growth in low-cost passenger flights, often to holiday destinations. Some people say that government should try to reduce air traffic by taxing it more heavily. Do you agree or disagree? <br />\n<br />\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. <br />\n<br />\nWrite at least 250 words. <br />\n<br />\nA: Over the last decade, low-cost airline companies, such as HKexpress and Peach Airline, have enjoyed a rapid growth in their business. It is argued that the government should rise the tax in order to reduce air traffic. I completely disagree with it based on following reasons. <br />\n<br />\nTo begin with, increasing tax will drop the number of tourists. Tourism, which regards as export of service in terms of economics, is one of the major component in GDP. Thailand is a good example. The entire Thai economy is supported by tourism. If the government impose &quot;air traffic tax&quot; , the economics revenue from tourism will probably go down. Although imposing &quot;air traffic tax&quot; can ease the current situation of air traffic, the economics loss far outweighs the mentioned benefits. <br />\n<br />\nApart from reducing number of tourists, heavy air traffic tax hinders the flow of talents. Cost of travelling is certainly a major consideration for taking oversea jobs or not. For those professional people who need to travel around the work frequently, such as corporate relationship manager in bank industry, imposing extra tax to them will certainly lower the incentive to work oversea. As a result, it will lead to less opportunities of making business or even no foreign investments and ideas come to our own countries. This explains why the mobility of talents is vital. <br />\n<br />\nTo conclude, it is no reason for the government to impose or rise &quot;Air traffic tax&quot; because of loss in tourists and blocking the flow of talents."},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-01-10T04:00:26.000Z","msg":"Over the last decade,<span style=\"color: red;\">low-cost airlines</span>, such as HKexpress and Peach Airline, <span style=\"color: red;\">enjoyed</span>a rapid growth in their business, <span style=\"color: red;\"> by increasing flight frequency to satisfy passengers&rsquo; needs.</span> It is argued that the government should <span style=\"color: red;\"> raise</span> the tax regarding the noise pollution caused by current air traffic.
