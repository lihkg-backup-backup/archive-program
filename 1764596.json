The CA ruled that the TVB news reports were a factual account of confrontations and the responses from different parties encompassing a wide range of views of the related issues. The CA&rsquo;s findings is an attestation that our news are accurate, fair and impartial. Since June, TVB has been providing round-the-clock live coverage of the civil unrest as well as violent clashes and is the most watched TV news channel. We always ensure strict compliance of the regulatory requirement throughout. The complaints were irrational and malicious with the sole purpose of undermining freedom of the press."},{"pid":"b72cfd5bb1836242405cb79932d6dff770532a8c","tid":1764596,"uid":327462,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-01T08:36:55.000Z","msg":"CCTVB死番上支那算啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
