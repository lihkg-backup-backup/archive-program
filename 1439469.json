Here is what I said:<br />\n<br />\n&quot;On paper, the police in Hong Kong follow Carrie Lam's orders, but in reality, they listen to instructions from Beijing via the liaison office. Beijing has secretly added to the Hong Kong police force, which is 30,000-strong, a number of policemen who speak Cantonese like Hong Kong from the neighbouring Guangdong province, so that they can better integrate. That is what my sources told me and it is a pretty serious development. In fact, Carrie Lam does not have a free hand on domestic security issues. &quot;<br />\n<br />\nI would add that I don't know the exact number of mainland Chinese police personnel deployed in HK although more recent sources have indicated that it could be around 2,000.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"ca5a9c77444628ef4856e17fa03d913a3278e402","tid":1439469,"uid":164043,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-10T06:19:48.000Z","msg":"有咩好反"},{"pid":"c463f591a7bda93b071cc8a3ea151f707db23ab0","tid":1439469,"uid":142854,"like":4,"dislike":1,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-10T06:20:27.000Z","msg":"你都傻<br />\n我2萬4一個月"},{"pid":"220d5d89ce1a5f8c2bff3b74292228dfed52a862","tid":1439469,"uid":76216,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-10T06:20:47.000Z","msg":"黑社會都唔反 反頂頭大佬？"},{"pid":"88546589f8cfd87ba2f062d66fe2fd34a4704dbf","tid":1439469,"uid":3696,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-10T06:22:03.000Z","msg":"緊急！關於港島東反送中反黑大遊行<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1439067\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1439067</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"943a9da0fc6a756b6b4104ebedfce1b0884da795","tid":1439469,"uid":94371,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-10T06:23:56.000Z","msg":"記憶中睇過個po講啲狗係 可以請公安幫手執法， 不過唔清楚洗唔洗公開"},{"pid":"2c78d7df571c910dfe05442252139fcd8f9824d9","tid":1439469,"uid":175431,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-10T06:39:04.000Z","msg":"明反唔到都要暗爆啦"},{"pid":"3b2b8f930e50f9d2744cb458ef120accdeaadf16","tid":1439469,"uid":16864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-10T06:40:32.000Z","msg":"已經同化左"},{"pid":"b1eecbabab75c446245b347618514ed8854a5a6c","tid":1439469,"uid":10722,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-10T06:41:45.000Z","msg":"根本佢地唔會知 <br />\n大家都有香港身分證 點分？"},{"pid":"879d63a6c54e1115e75fa70de603370471f34cf2","tid":1439469,"uid":175431,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-27T02:33:31.000Z","msg":"//<br />\n這樣，就明白為何會在一星期內出現數個證據確鑿的警員違規新聞。有的，是政府主動放出來，煽動香港人去仇警。香港警察當然值得報應，但香港政府現在是重建大台，「公正」地審判警察，然後就金蟬脫殼了。獨立調查委員會，成為政府推卸責任的工具。<br />\n//<br />\n<br />\n有良知警察快D醒，諗下點自保啦，同埋爆料呀！"}]}
