The communist-party-controlled HKSAR government under the leadership of Ms. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has, the first time in history, demonstrated totalitarianism towards anti-government voices. Current HKSAR government and the local Hong Kong Police Force, has been repeatedly violating &lsquo;The Geneva Convention&rsquo;, &lsquo;International Humanitarian Law&rsquo; and other conventions/treaties in many incidents over the course of these three months since 12th June 2019, and <strong>situations are becoming uncontrollable as more cases of police violence emerge and local triad gang attacks against protestors are ignored. </strong><br />\n<br />\nI, (   full name   ), as a permanent citizen of Hong Kong, have no any other options but writing this email jointly with other stakes of Hong Kong, to ask the world for a fair trial to account for the violation of international conventions by the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), whose actions have continually being supported by Ms. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, Chief Executive of HKSAR government, and other related high officials.<br />\n<br />\nThis series of protests in Hong Kong started from a controversial amendment bill of &lsquo;Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation&rsquo;. Lacking a general consent from the public, different sectors and stakeholders of Hong Kong, the HKSAR government attempted to force pass this bill through the 2nd reading in the Legislative Council (LEGCO) of HKSAR, in which pro-Beijing DAB party has taken majority of the seats. The general public has therefore organized series of legal and mainly peaceful demonstrations, protests, assemblies and strike within these months to request a complete withdrawal of the bill. <br />\n<br />\nHowever, during these largely legal protests, incidence of police violence against peaceful protestors has been widely reported by media, and some are already verified by the Amnesty International. Yet, hitherto no legal actions have the HKSAR government took place to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring. To make circumstances even worse, Ms Carrie Lam has stated clearly that she &lsquo;would not betray the Hong Kong Police Force&rsquo; in a public press conference.   <br />\n<br />\nIn the face of totalitarianism and police brutality, not only those peaceful protestors are threatened, many innocent lives of Hong Kong citizens that have not involved in any part of the protests are also suffering in life-threatening situations.<strong> Dear U.N., E.U., P.C.A.-C.P.A., I.C.R.C., Interpol., international organizations, governments across borders and continents, and international media, Hong Kong citizens urgently need your help. Please take any appropriate actions wherever possible to immediately intervene, halt, convict, monitor, and trial the actions of our violent &lsquo;police force&rsquo;. </strong>The followings conclude the crimes of police violence by HKPF."},{"pid":"ddbcce47ed9766252993121552a091225578f6e4","tid":1455435,"uid":295455,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-12T09:01:52.000Z","msg":"<strong>(1) Unlawful use of riot control non-lethal kinetic projectiles. </strong><br />\n<br />\nVerified by Amnesty International, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) Special Tactical Squad has attacked a peaceful protestor with rubber bullet aiming at head in 12th June 2019, causing severe injury of the eye, and most likely permanent disability of the protestor as examined by medical doctor.

Tear gas rounds, as a non-lethal crowd/riot control measure, were misused in confounded spaces and locations with no clear escape route. As verified by Amnesty International, HKPF unit shot tear gas towards cornered protestors on 12th June 2019, near CITIC Tower, Admiralty. Protestors fled inside the building while tear gas rounds were fired at the same time, causing a high risk of stampede. With no evacuation exits in CITIC TOWER, protestors were trapped inside the building with tear gas, posting a severe life-threatening situation as protestors could possibly suffocate. Two similar cases just occurred in 11th August 2019 near Kwai Chung and Tai Koo, as HKPF launched tear gas round indoors in local MTR train stations.

In such cases, the consequences may be lethal. Using chemical irritants in closed spaces has multiple risks, including high levels of exposure, leading to injury and death.
