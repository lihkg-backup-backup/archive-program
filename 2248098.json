If you use a smartphone to surf the Internet, your WiFi provider or a WiFi owner can see your browsing history.\n\nExcept for browsing history, they can also see the following information:\n\nApps you were using\nSource &amp; destination IP addresses\nUnencrypted HTTP websites data\nHowever, let&rsquo;s assume your WiFi admin wants to see everything you do online bad enough, and he's invested some resources into a logging infrastructure.\n\nThen, even your delicate data can be subject to monitoring.\n\nFor instance:\n\nCall &amp; text logs\nText messages\nVoice messages\nImages or photos\nThat&rsquo;s, of course, more than enough to completely ruin your privacy and personal life.\n\nBut, everything can be even worse if hackers intercept the traffic you transmit over WiFi.\n\nThen they may easily steal your account credentials, passwords, credit card details, and other valuable information no matter what device you use to access the Internet.\n\nThe truth is that WiFi is flawed and, by its nature, open technology.\n\nSo, unless you protect yourself with VPN encryption, you can never be confident in the security of your data.</code></pre><br />\n<br />\n上網見到呢段嘢<br />\n有冇IT嘅巴打可以解釋一吓<br />\n同埋有咩解決方法<br />\n感謝🙏🏼"},{"pid":"9ef08b5c5e502286ef67acab2a335d8b535183db","tid":2248098,"uid":38904,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-18T10:57:40.000Z","msg":"叫咗你唔好hack你條女個network㗎啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
