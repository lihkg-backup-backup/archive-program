At about 10pm today, our police force rushed into our railway system in Prince Edward station, got into the carriage and indifferently beat up everyone in it regardless of whether they are protesters or simply passengers. They ignored the weapon guidelines and fired tear gas indoor in the carriage which is in fact lethal. Also, they beat up innocent people causing them seriously wounded. Some passengers kneeled before them asking them to stop but the response they got were to be beaten even harder. Ironically, the police haven&rsquo;t arrested the passengers after they got beaten up, showing that the only purpose of their brutality was to sort their anger to violence but not dispersing the crowd.<br />\n<br />\nAs Hongkongers are experiencing a humanitarian crisis, I hope you can help by pressing against the Chinese and Hong Kong government to stop their violence against the people of Hong Kong and apply punitive measures against any government officials who are responsible for these acts of violence. Please also help to lobby other congressmen and congresswomen to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act when Congress resume.<br />\n<br />\nThank you very much for your kind attention and I hope you will stand with the people of Hong Kong in their fight for democracy and justice!<br />\n<br />\nXXX<br />\n8/31//2019"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-01T07:50:39.000Z","msg":"831"},{"pid":"69205d65b17c0caa4fbc6efe42702eb1bb8e0a97","tid":1526609,"uid":278981,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-01T08:14:54.000Z","msg":"831"},{"pid":"1cb92b5f814c3bafe660eaaca2fdb0c4c49dd27c","tid":1526609,"uid":278981,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-01T08:15:07.000Z","msg":"831"}]}
