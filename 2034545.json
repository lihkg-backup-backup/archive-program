This latest outrage was perpetrated ostensibly as a response to the news that a regime of law and enforcement protecting national security would be set up in Hong Kong. Regardless of the reason, this is plainly not acceptable.<br />\n<br />\nIn particular, we refer to the news that one of our fellow legal professionals has been subject to a savage and unjustifiable attack. Regardless of creed or political views, such action is indefensible.<br />\n<br />\nWe take this opportunity to pose the following questions to those who represent the legal profession in the Law Society #Eric Cheung, and the Legislative Council #Dennis Kwok, #Tanya Chan, #Alvin Yeung, as well as those who hold outsized influence with the public #Benny Tai, #Alan Leong who have through their past conduct or words, demonstrated sympathy for such unwarranted violence.<br />\n<br />\n1. Do you agree that violence is not an acceptable solution to the current situation in Hong Kong: specifically that it is unacceptable for a member of the legal profession to be attacked so viciously that he ended up in hospital?<br />\n<br />\n2. Do you agree that those who are in positions of influence have the responsibility to ensure their public comments do not encourage crimes or violence against those who do not hold the same views? We refer specifically to statements such as:<br />\n- &ldquo;violence can sometimes be a solution to problems&rdquo; made by Mr Alan Leong;<br />\n<br />\n- &ldquo;criminal records can make life more interesting&rdquo; made by Legco member Mr Alvin Yeung; and<br />\n- the commentary that &ldquo;if one breaks the law, one ought to be punished&rdquo; is an outdated and obsolete concept, as made by Mr Benny Tai.<br />\n<br />\nWe also note that the 5 candidates for the 2020 Law Society Council election who call themselves &ldquo;Independent and Firm Voices&rdquo; have issued a statement in respect of this incident. In this statement, they expressed concern regarding &ldquo;violence against individuals&rdquo; but at the same time described the perpetrators of the massive scale of violence as &ldquo;peaceful protestors&rdquo;. In particular, the characterisation that a one-way attack on a fellow legal professional was actually the result of a two-sided &ldquo;altercation&rdquo;."},{"pid":"903e92a52c9dc14c50eacc22deded5daac97ae8f","tid":2034545,"uid":26608,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-25T09:50:16.000Z","msg":"We would like to put on record that consent for yesterday's mass gatherings was not obtained from the police, and that most of the gathering and in particular the one at Causeway Bay constituted unlawful assembly and rioting under the Public Order Ordinance, and were in breach of the prohibition against gathering of over 8 people under the Prevention and Control of Disease (Prohibition on Group Gathering) Regulation.<br />\n<br />\nWe demand that these 5 candidates:<br />\n<br />\n(A) withdraw their wrongful characterization of those who participated in any part of Sunday's unlawful activities as &ldquo;peaceful protestors&rdquo; and the wrongful attribution of the one-sided attack to a mere &ldquo;altercation&rdquo;;<br />\n<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\n(B) apologize to the public for their obfuscation on the illegality of the gathering as well as downplaying the culpability of the perpetrators of the violence.<br />\n<br />\nLet us be clear([tag everyone]):<br />\n<br />\nI. any answer to the negative in respect of questions 1 &amp; 2 above,<br />\n<br />\nII. any refusal to cut ties with those who reject the above principles, and<br />\n<br />\nIII. in relation to the 5 &ldquo;Independent and Firm Voices&rdquo; candidates, any refusal to withdraw their mischaracterisation and wrongful attribution and apologize to the public in line with demand (A) &amp; (B) above,<br />\n<br />\nwould be interpreted rightly as an abandonment of one of our own, as a dereliction of your sworn duty to fairly uphold and defend the Rule of Law and as the cheap partisan politicisation of a calamity that is befalling Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nA group of furious lawyers"},{"pid":"ae6d8bf237468e8e73f1ef48a031750ce8efeed0","tid":2034545,"uid":159916,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-25T09:51:14.000Z","msg":"無視<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/sowhat.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"9d06cd2244ee297f48fc818d69fbf8b19734a1e5","tid":2034545,"uid":225130,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-25T09:51:22.000Z","msg":"盲人律師<br />\n播榮光比人踢落車拉左既周律師"},{"pid":"b7bdc38a1a6fbc4172c18a53d904da1a7572db08","tid":2034545,"uid":13125,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-25T09:51:42.000Z","msg":"點解要比d唔知咩人上位SET議題？"},{"pid":"d32b68fc24ae6de582f937cf4ba8c5669b476535","tid":2034545,"uid":96182,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-05-25T09:52:10.000Z","msg":"多鳩魚啦扮咩無黨無派<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n9成咪又係何已完之流果d<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n發生左咁多法治已死法庭已死立法會已死既事你班無黨無派有冇出過一聲呀<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a0399e8cbc414358f07df5f1ef0a21da21da0f51","tid":2034545,"uid":287422,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-25T09:52:56.000Z","msg":"報比律師會，迫律師會查班人有無冒認律師先講啦"},{"pid":"a5cf290921da71a9bb62b224ad51cc9c77984c83","tid":2034545,"uid":14494,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-25T09:54:07.000Z","msg":"721又唔見佢出聲明？突然訓醒左？"},{"pid":"eddb124746a271702dd9f84144f8ab5b319986da","tid":2034545,"uid":31151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-25T09:55:35.000Z","msg":"之前有個律師無啦啦比狗拉落車打果時唔見你眼火爆？"},{"pid":"2766430fd166bb5dc0466699f2499109d8e25bfd","tid":2034545,"uid":51707,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"d32b68fc24ae6de582f937cf4ba8c5669b476535","tid":2034545,"uid":96182,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-05-25T09:52:10.000Z","msg":"多鳩魚啦扮咩無黨無派<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n9成咪又係何已完之流果d<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n發生左咁多法治已死法庭已死立法會已死既事你班無黨無派有冇出過一聲呀<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-25T09:57:45.000Z","msg":"如果簽名聯署可能又驚俾人踢爆原來唔係律師就唔好喇<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n呢班人好似如獲至寶咁，小題大做<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0d9d765b84178f96c8793983476cf6cea030a6f3","tid":2034545,"uid":185656,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-25T10:07:03.000Z","msg":"junk email"}]}
