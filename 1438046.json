What I want to address now is Hong Kong Police Force keeps using expired Tear Gas to the protesters. There are already academic researches, together with observation and survey conducted by Hong Kong professionals, stating that expired Tear Gas could cause long term injury especially the cyanide inside.<br />\n<br />\nThis is already out of control and can be regarded as humanity crime, especially the protesters do not hold any lethal weapon from the very beginning. Using expired Tear Gas could be equivalent to using chemical weapon to the innocent citizens.<br />\n<br />\nTherefore, I would urge to know is there any proper channel that I can complain further, or any other evidences I need to submit so that the preliminary examinations.<br />\n<br />\nI would like to stress that, even though Hong Kong is an international city and quite developed, it does not mean humanity crime will not happen. We cannot overlook this case or the world will have a false impression that developed country / city is not under the radar of being monitored for humanity crime.<br />\n<br />\nThank you and I would love to hear your reply soon."},{"pid":"6e42f60c3cf0c393034c485066c60f431e47f20f","tid":1438046,"uid":25676,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-11T15:41:37.000Z","msg":"Pish <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a244bc032ddc405291ba72405db5766faba9fc81","tid":1438046,"uid":25676,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-11T16:10:02.000Z","msg":"重有PCA (Permanent Court of Arbitration)<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c413b328a3e4e80de45532b4221d4bd127faa49b","tid":1438046,"uid":221210,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a244bc032ddc405291ba72405db5766faba9fc81","tid":1438046,"uid":25676,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-11T16:10:02.000Z","msg":"重有PCA (Permanent Court of Arbitration)<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-11T17:13:34.000Z","msg":"多謝提點，即做"},{"pid":"fc031102b8272e8b7f0752a1acf0da45cdc5338e","tid":1438046,"uid":221210,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-11T17:17:46.000Z","msg":"不過PCA好似主要做調解多？"}]}
