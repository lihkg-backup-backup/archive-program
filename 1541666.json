The bill has NOT been withdrawn!<br />\n<br />\nToday, the leader of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, proposed a motion of the withdrawal of the extradition bill. This, however, does not signify the victory of our battle.<br />\n<br />\nIn the press release, the leader blatantly dismissed the other four demands of two millions protestors, including the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry and universal suffrage. Also, the bill is still NOT FORMALLY withdrawn as the retraction is a mere motion that can be vetoed by the pro-Beijing camp of the legislative body. While the legislative council will only continue the meeting or session in early October to deal with any agenda/proposal of bills. Carrie Lam is playing trick to get more time to first of all try to relieve the social atmosphere by saying such non-legally binding words, at the same time keep abusively arresting protesters and suppressing any dissenting voices. Until October if the suppression is effective, she will continue the bill to second and then third reading quickly to pass it in the legislative council. We, Hongkongers, know her too well, this is her habit.<br />\nOur demands are still not met.<br />\n<br />\nThe fugitive bill saga reveals the abuse of power of the police and the tightening grip of freedom from Beijing. Since June, we have seen the police force harming civilians in train stations; Beijing threatening to mobilise the garrison. To Hongkongers, the protest is now an act of resistance against police brutality and the narrowing freedom taken away by China. We are fighting for our future.<br />\n<br />\nIn such difficult time, we would love to ask for your support. Your understanding of our situation is important to pressurise the government.<br />\n<br />\nWe shall never surrender.
