target=\"_blank\">http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/news/20171011/57318427</a><br />\n<br />\n曾聲援被判囚的雙學三子、英國保守黨人權委員會副主席Benedict Rogers，外電報道指他今早從泰國曼谷抵港時，被拒絕入境，入境處並無交代原因。Benedict Rogers一直關注亞洲多國的人權狀況，今年8月曾在倫敦組織聲援黃之鋒、羅冠聰及周永康的行動，又曾批評英國政府作為《中英聯合聲明》簽署國，一直未有盡力為香港發聲，過去一直被中方視為眼中釘。他今午接受英國《衞報》訪問時表示，對被拒入境感到震驚，但坦言過去已有人警告過他遲早會被拒入境，認為今次是另一事例反映一國兩制正步向死亡。<br />\n<br />\nRogers曾於1997年至2002年在香港定居，今次訪港是除了與朋友會面，亦會了解香港最新的民主狀況。他向《衞報》記者稱，當入境處職員押解他上機離境時，他曾問對方是否意味一國兩制已死，他指該入境處職員幾乎眼泛淚光，表情哀傷，只回覆他是在履行職務，無法回應，Rogers坦言為香港感到非常悲哀。<br />\n本身是律師的民主黨何俊仁中午曾趕赴機場跟進事件。他指Bendict Rogers今晨11時搭飛機抵港，自己在中午12時20分收到對方電話求助，指被入境處拒絕入境並帶入房間。何俊仁致電入境處了解，一位官員在下午1時32分稱稍後再覆電話，結果一直無回覆，何俊仁先後致電8次無人接聽，最終入境處遣返Bendict Rogers後，下午2時25分再致電通知何俊仁。<br />\n何俊仁批評入境處做法卑劣，拒絕與代表律師接觸，拖到遣返當事人後，入境處官員才回覆電話，更聲稱「好忙、要查」。他形容涉事官員說法完全是廢話，只想玩弄代表律師，「知道律師係出面等，就唔理你，直到將要求入境嘅人送上機，先話畀律師聽。香港一個叫法治地方，咁樣對付律師呢，唔怪得法治地位一路跌。」他計劃向申訴專員公署投訴。<br />\n何俊仁指過往有不少人被拒入境，自己都可以介入事件協助當事人，今次入境處處理手法前所未見，做法「大陸化、公安化」，慨嘆內地維穩已影響到香港，更質疑入境處已無獨立決定權，由內地官員操控出入境權。<br />\n特首林鄭月娥下午在記者會被英國《金融時報》問到事件時，未有正面回應，只稱香港一直在落實一國兩制。"},{"pid":"1258c6d40d0c362afb31d97536a5e51c076e77a5","tid":432169,"uid":63669,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T09:27:07.000Z","msg":"<img

entering Hong Kong <br />\n <br />\nBenedict Rogers, the deputy chair of the Conservative party&rsquo;s human rights commission, escorted on to flight out of former British colony<br />\n<br />\nA leading British human rights activist who has been a vocal critic of China&rsquo;s erosion of Hong Kong&rsquo;s political freedoms has been barred from entering the former colony on the eve of a key political summit in Beijing.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBenedict Rogers, the deputy chair of the Conservatives&rsquo; human rights commission, flew into Hong Kong on Wednesday morning on a Thai Airways flight from Bangkok but said he was stopped at immigration and refused entry.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;They gave me no explanation at all,&rdquo; he told the Guardian by phone as he prepared to fly back to Thailand on Wednesday afternoon. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;It is absolutely bizarre &hellip; I feel shocked. I had received a warning that this might happen so I was mentally prepared for it but was hoping it wouldn&rsquo;t happen. I feel very shocked. I feel it is yet another example of, if not the death, then the death throes of &lsquo;One country, two systems&rsquo;&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nRogers lived in Hong Kong from 1997 to 2002, and said he had been coming back on a private visit to see friends, including a number of prominent democracy activists. &ldquo;I wanted to come and meet people and learn about the current situation,&rdquo; he said.<br />\n<br />\nSpeaking as he prepared to leave the former colony, on a flight back to Bangkok, Rogers claimed he had been indirectly warned, through a third party, that the Chinese embassy in London was &ldquo;extremely concerned&rdquo; about his plans to visit Hong Kong. He claimed embassy officials had conveyed a warning that he might not be let in. &ldquo;I decided to go ahead and to put it to the test.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nAs he was escorted to his flight out of Hong Kong, Rogers said he turned to the immigration officer taking him to the plane and thanked him for treating him well. &ldquo;I said: &lsquo;Does this mean &lsquo;one country, two systems&rsquo; is dead? Is it &lsquo;one country, one system&rsquo; now?&rsquo;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;He looked at me actually very sadly, almost with tears in his eyes, and said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m just doing my job, I can&rsquo;t comment.&rsquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I feel very sad for it. I feel sad for Hong Kong. If a private citizen from Britain who is coming basically to meet old friends and new friends &hellip; is denied entry then it is a very sad day for Hong Kong.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nMartin Lee, a veteran democracy campaigner who was among those Rogers had hoped to meet, said he was ashamed that Rogers had been banned. &ldquo;This should never happen in a free society &hellip; Hong Kong should not be a city that bans viewpoints, it should be international and open.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nLee said he suspected Beijing had ordered Hong Kong authorities to refuse Rogers entry. &ldquo;How can you say we have a high degree of autonomy when Beijing intervenes over one man who has broken no laws trying to visit Hong Kong?&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nAnson Chan, Hong Kong&rsquo;s top civil servant at the time of handover, urged the British government to make an official protest to the Hong Kong and Chinese governments.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Is it going to be the norm that anyone who dares speak against the official line will be barred from Hong Kong? It&rsquo;s increasingly looking that way,&rdquo; Chan said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to see this become the norm, it makes a mockery of Hong Kong as an international hub.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nChan said the political situation had deteriorated in recent years, leading to increasingly radical politics. &ldquo;Cases like this are why our younger generation is so angry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Every day we see examples of Hong Kong&rsquo;s rights and freedoms being eroded, of promises broken time and time again.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong&rsquo;s immigration department did not immediately respond to phone calls and an email seeking comment. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n好長, 唔post 晒, 想睇自己入link 睇"},{"pid":"57552116cdc880e9d07e7477f7518545bd3fd8ac","tid":432169,"uid":63669,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T10:06:17.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>唔俾見律師 ？</blockquote><br />\n<br />\n好似直接遣返"},{"pid":"bacc49bcf21fba3d687370798a208900d8485c2d","tid":432169,"uid":38523,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T10:08:27.000Z","msg":"支那廿年<br />\n香港玩完"},{"pid":"f0ee89998e49deb70fd7a6de63feb610ad0d9980","tid":432169,"uid":66784,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T10:16:24.000Z","msg":"當入境處職員押解他上機離境時，他曾問對方是否意味一國兩制已死，他指該入境處職員幾乎眼泛淚光，表情哀傷，只回覆他是在履行職務，無法回應<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/oh.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7581416d3eb2f5cdf8fe1a6c6285d8c8aba4bc60","tid":432169,"uid":33868,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T10:18:03.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />  月尾肥彭幫bno平權個陣更有理據</blockquote><br />\nBNO變居英權計劃BC <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n最好就只係俾現有有效BNO 既人轉.<br />\n唔續期個D 多數都係藍絲廢佬.<br />\n發下夢好喇.<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n一次性比有效BNO轉，以HMPO收到申請時間為限，今日截止，<br />\n以感謝對HM忠誠。"},{"pid":"133d45099da97b5a53cf63e81b96a89b5221cafb","tid":432169,"uid":16970,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T10:23:04.000Z","msg":"依個post一隻五毛都冇, 係勁嘅."},{"pid":"a39929108204fd43d0cb88d4bfce37f928b7f8a6","tid":432169,"uid":54927,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T10:23:53.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />  月尾肥彭幫bno平權個陣更有理據</blockquote><br />\nBNO變居英權計劃BC <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n最好就只係俾現有有效BNO 既人轉.<br />\n唔續期個D 多數都係藍絲廢佬.<br />\n發下夢好喇.<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 理撚得你<br />\n本人有BC即走啦<br />\n重同你講獨<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"98b8fabbc1229d6a75d81653d532efc69fbc3f8c","tid":432169,"uid":79563,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T10:27:33.000Z","msg":"英國就無GUTS啦<br />\n<br />\n轉頭將所有港共狗拒入英國<br />\n<br />\n又唔敢做, 垃圾"},{"pid":"e84fc2de6ddf584fcf042631f47432ab85b061b8","tid":432169,"uid":41423,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T11:07:54.000Z","msg":"拒絶所有特衰入英國境<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b0a82938dca93a43f9864ebd47f5153b27323371","tid":432169,"uid":113353,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T12:21:16.000Z","msg":"咁大件事無人理，淨係響度講車費津貼。。<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e7c5a1d654ce89b37cf6af56731bb9bec2303ebb","tid":432169,"uid":30768,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T12:23:45.000Z","msg":"抵啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/10.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c9f98afaacefec271bf7f721bbd551c3cef83d06","tid":432169,"uid":59898,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-10-11T12:24:59.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
