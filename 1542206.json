This is certainly a tough time for us Hong Kong people but also a tough time for all of you that have to witness it. I am writing this letter to explain what is currently happening in Hong Kong and why the &lsquo;Withdrawal&rsquo; of the bill is not only not a victory for us, but is putting us in grave danger in this movement.<br />\n<br />\nFor the last three months, we have been fighting on the street, on the internet, wishing the government and our Chief Executive, Carrie Lam to answer to our 5 demands. <br />\nThe 5 demands are:<br />\n1. Officially withdraw the China Extradition Bill <br />\n2. Establish an Independent Commission of Inquiry <br />\n3. Retract the classification of &lsquo;Riot&rsquo; to the whole movement<br />\n4. Amnesty for arrested protesters<br />\n5. Dual Universal Suffrage (Realizing true democracy)<br />\n<br />\nThe demands are all very reasonable and are not asked out of nowhere by the HK citizens. We are simply asking them to investigate the whole event in a fair manner, drop the charges of riot and help Hong Kong to take a step forward to democracy. We have made our demands very clear to the public months ago,  but the only respond we have is the government&rsquo;s play on word, and more violence wielded against us by the police force.<br />\n<br />\nSaying &lsquo;the bill is on pause/stopped&rsquo; and &lsquo;the bill is dead&rsquo; etc,. Which in fact, without officially withdrawing the bill, it will never be dead, it can always fake it&rsquo;s own death and come out of its slumber in the next Leg Co Year. Carrie Lam certainly knows it, but she insisted not to officially withdraw the bill. Whether if it&rsquo;s because of her personal pride, or by the order of the Central Government or any other factor. SHE DID NOT WITHDRAW THE BILL. <br />\nNot after a million people walked on the street, not after two million people walked on the street, not after almost 3 months of constant conflicts in Hong Kong. If she wanted to listen to the people, she would have had her chance."},{"pid":"9c76ef8ee8f75b3ca76956b9aa28ac03c7a7593e","tid":1542206,"uid":84646,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T19:09:34.000Z","msg":"The Withdrawal at this point means nothing to us, millions of people went on the street two months ago and she did not seem to care. Carrie Lam kept playing with words without taking real responsibility to address all the problems the bill had caused. The current movement is not just about the Extradition Bill anymore, the bill has exposed the incapability and the corruption of the government, the police and the whole system.<br />\n<br />\nWithdrawing the bill is not a victory of any kind to us. We did not win a single battle and we certainly haven&rsquo;t win the war. Only by fully granting us all 5 demands can we finally start restoring Hong Kong to a more liberal society and bring it under the light of democracy.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nYours Sincerely,<br />\nA Hong Kong Citizen"},{"pid":"4f7221c4dabddc8185c53b6bcf79a6dcc7e83d44","tid":1542206,"uid":84646,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T19:11:52.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"5cca164fcca2e0b1abd99c45fc2b2571207b5007","tid":1542206,"uid":84646,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T19:12:02.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"a81b5c229ad36bd03118b8900a3c90892b4db724","tid":1542206,"uid":84646,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T19:12:19.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"53e154194fd214bb69abc384692eda743d504481","tid":1542206,"uid":127177,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T19:28:10.000Z","msg":"No one understands English <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4ca27a9a3e186f3eb19cb6f3db7df7b25b74613d","tid":1542206,"uid":106252,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T19:29:45.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />push"},{"pid":"d34207bccce85ae0c8142fe022055bdfa619f3b3","tid":1542206,"uid":158760,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T19:34:17.000Z","msg":"Pish englandish is best"},{"pid":"e6c7d8edf06c5e60aaa6389a5db05a7e8513f6c7","tid":1542206,"uid":112391,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T19:36:30.000Z","msg":"My English SUCKS but I can pish it."},{"pid":"e11b3aab6d035bb17d6aac512294c647681e9ca4","tid":1542206,"uid":64935,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T19:38:01.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"b49f613600be2ec521bd2bee020fbab882b2e45b","tid":1542206,"uid":270684,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T19:39:26.000Z","msg":"推<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"65c310fd4a68a2174ecd9268df098d1771691267","tid":1542206,"uid":84646,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-05T00:12:20.000Z","msg":"有咩要改請出聲<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />只係打咗自己想講嘅野出來"},{"pid":"c227b6f59876364f40a15e695c64dac1b3ac1447","tid":1542206,"uid":84646,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-05T00:12:56.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"e5e2073da4bb7a7dfd1628f392ba9ace7228563d","tid":1542206,"uid":75782,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-05T00:23:10.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"b1fac45717cac52b4f4ca50dfe28276ed8873d0d","tid":1542206,"uid":247845,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-05T00:24:36.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b85eb19b2b07cedb8753693f83975c6cbd060e1f","tid":1542206,"uid":17667,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-05T00:25:13.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b90653978b8131eaaa5c3ce7b1982074d2a7d9be","tid":1542206,"uid":84646,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-05T00:26:55.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"bc56460a1a72c81a28b9c344eebcbcf2c875bd58","tid":1542206,"uid":260722,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-05T00:31:22.000Z","msg":"push<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThis is good for foreigners to understand what HK situation"},{"pid":"6e36d715b1cf72944a3a878f02f85e550d930d05","tid":1542206,"uid":302173,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-05T00:32:22.000Z","msg":"PISH"},{"pid":"f34c50377c39dccbc7aa57db5a6818e7d54466ba","tid":1542206,"uid":300915,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-05T00:35:23.000Z","msg":"Great letter.
