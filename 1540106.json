Withdrawal of the amendment bill is only one of them. The five demands are:<br />\n1. Full withdrawal of the extradition bill <br />\n2. A commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality <br />\n3. Retracting the classification of protesters as &ldquo;rioters&rdquo; <br />\n4. Amnesty for arrested protesters <br />\n5. Dual universal suffrage for both the Legislative Council and<br />\nthe Chief Executive <br />\nThe 2nd, 3rd, and the 4th demands arise because the government refused to withdraw the bill amendment after a marching of 1 million Hong Kong people. The 5th demand is the ultimate solution of the turmoil in Hong Kong. <br />\nNow the government withdraws the bill, and it is not a concession at all. It&rsquo;s only a tactic of the government trying to kill the movement by the people. <br />\n<br />\nFIVE DEMANDS NOT ONE LESS"},{"pid":"9f26f48814b3de859b5d84632b269aeb79af805b","tid":1540106,"uid":183055,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T13:01:33.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: gold;\">Why Extradition Bill is NOT officially withdrawn yet?</span></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: violet;\">According to: <br />\nHK Legislative Council Rules of Procedure<br />\n香港立法會議事規則<br />\nPART K PROCEDURE ON BILLS 法案的處理程序</span></strong></span><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/txSCi3t.gif\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FtxSCi3t.gif&h=39431df2&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"d70635f70649b2030bfd864678f5c1ee09213023","tid":1540106,"uid":57737,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T13:02:40.000Z","msg":"Too little too late"},{"pid":"8a9eefd896c4e06babf5385c3a0bc9b070d40bce","tid":1540106,"uid":193026,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"50ef9ba4d60e4bed9354416a95da30e08f784159","tid":1540106,"uid":57737,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":6,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T10:51:05.000Z","msg":"Dear foreigners,<br />\n<br />\nAs there was a public announcement from Carrie Lam this evening (4 Sep) which agree to withdraw the extradition bill.
