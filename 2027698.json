Hong-kongers&rsquo; goal has revolved from stopping the extradition bill to advocating the five demands. However the SAR Government has not just refused to listen to the people&rsquo;s clear demands, but resolved to using the police as a tool to unrightfully arrest and murder protestors. Hong Kong&rsquo;s core values like the rule of law, freedom of speech, the right to assembly and rally, have been corroded drastically since last year. &ldquo;One country, two systems, Hong Kong people rule hong kong&rdquo; have all become non-existent slogans. The honeymoon has long been over, and &ldquo;one country, one system&rdquo; is the dreaded reality that over a million Hong Kongers are awakening to.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nForeword<br />\n<br />\nThe Hong Kong SAR Government has become the meaningless puppet of the CCP, and continues to raise bills like the National Anthem Bill to throttle freedom of speech in Hong Kong. The threat of establishing the Article 23 of the Basic Law has always been imminent. When the police, the courts and even the legislature has become mere chess pieces of the CCP, the hong kong people have awaken to the truth that struggles within the establishment is useless and only when we embrace the idea of an independent Hong Kong state, can we possibly build a government that truly belongs to the people. Although we once thought Hong Kong as an independent state was only a distant dream, throughout the pass year we have heard countless voices on the streets starting to demand &ldquo;Independence is the only way for Hong Kong&rdquo;. We believe that in the ever approaching threat of the CCP, a growing number of Hong Kongers will awaken and join our league to fight for and build an independent Hong Kong state.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAims<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHenceforth, we will now propose achievable short term and medium term goals to attain independence for Hong Kong. May we continue to march forward with a clear goal and<br />\nSteadfast determination.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe propose in the short term to:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\ni）Further develop labour unions in every trade, and increase the penetration rates in each<br />\nindustry<br />\n<br />\nii）through developing trade unions, establish development plans for each industry<br />\n<br />\niii）Establish an independent survey body to clarify Hong Kongers&rsquo; views on how to achieve<br />\nindependence<br />\n<br />\niv）Develop local enterprises and aim to achieve self-sufficiency in Hong Kong&rsquo;s Economy<br />\n<br />\nv）Increase liaison between Frontliner teams<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMedium term goals:<br />\n<br />\nEstablish a People&rsquo;s Parliament through election<br />\n<br />\nII) Establish an overseas provisional government fund<br />\n<br />\nIII) Establish an Hong Kong Independence Army, funded by the provisional government fund<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLong term goals:<br />\n<br />\nI) Write and enact a Hong Kong Constitution<br />\n<br />\nII）Establish a provisional government and elect a Cabinet and President<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nConclusion<br />\n<br />\nThroughout the pass year fellow protestors faced much opposition and fellow Hong Kongers and global community have awakened to the threat that the CCP is to the global community. Hong Kongers will use this declaration to mark the start of a new page, and keep finding new ways to fight for freedom, and seek Hong Kong independence. May Hong Kong rise again from the ashes and be reborn gloriously as an independent Hong Kong state. Glory to Hong Kong."},{"pid":"5bc43f9e108ebc0b42020056de837471eeceb7dd","tid":2027698,"uid":154486,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-21T13:14:37.000Z","msg":"pushpushpush"},{"pid":"b8c3a8428c8268b2663823b2764454c7d89431ee","tid":2027698,"uid":154486,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-21T13:15:28.000Z","msg":"推出去推出去"},{"pid":"ce7f91384bc81f2ba21d86eb1a09d119fac602c1","tid":2027698,"uid":253978,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-05-21T13:15:42.000Z","msg":"獨立宣言<img
