press conference held by the Narcotics Bureau of the Hong Kong Police (Police) yesterday in relation to its investigation into the trading of the shares of Next Digital Limited (Next Digital).<br />\n<br />\nThe Police indicated that it is investigating suspected conspiracy to defraud and money laundering &ndash; as well as potential false trading &ndash; in the shares of Next Digital.  False trading is an offence under the market misconduct provisions of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO).

The SFC is ready to respond to any requests made by the Police under the MOU for this type of assistance in relation to any potential offences under the SFO.<br />\n<br />\nAs investigations are continuing, the SFC is not in a position to comment any further.<br />\n<br />\nEnd"},"citedBy":12,"replyTime":"2020-09-11T11:28:34.000Z","msg":"中文呢你老味?我睇得明啊,但其他手足未必明嘛。做多少少按返做中文先貼上嚟得唔得啊,有時諗多步可以幫到好多人手唔該<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/no.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/no.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-09-11T11:30:04.000Z","msg":"【最新】證監會就警方調查壹傳媒股份涉虚假交易罕有發聲明回應；聲明引雙方之合作備忘錄，指證監會已準備好在警方按備忘錄提出要求下提供協助<br />\n<a href=\"https://news.now.com/urgentnews.jsp?taskId=18496&amp;refer=Share\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.now.com%2Furgentnews.jsp%3FtaskId%3D18496%26refer%3DShare&d=lPOaXpfFeUboYNX3auI3fslSugA1I0CCabXjLbCjl00%3D&h=c7ed4a40\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.now.com%2Furgentnews.jsp%3FtaskId%3D18496%26refer%3DShare&h=96d704c3\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://news.now.com/urgentnews.jsp?taskId=18496&amp;refer=Share</a>"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-11T11:39:04.000Z","msg":"唔出聲明就唔會提供協助?<br />\n全香港都係附屬於狗務處 你有資格say no?"},{"pid":"956416bd9e2221370856b352eb3753213f76ad49","tid":2198485,"uid":23707,"like":20,"dislike":0,"score":20,"quote":{"pid":"52d088b6509dba0d7dfd29b111bf1746a185524b","tid":2198485,"uid":11291,"like":68,"dislike":0,"score":68,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-09-11T11:30:28.000Z","msg":"搵掃毒去拉人已經覺得係on9"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-09-11T11:40:27.000Z","msg":"佢話係話你聽我哋大撚哂嘅<br />\n下次會係銀樂隊去"},{"pid":"5746169a1cc1e09082dc1b74d40668138e7fb092","tid":2198485,"uid":48083,"like":47,"dislike":0,"score":47,"quote":{"pid":"407d89c367f069c959c77a9c876f7b55e6f026ab","tid":2198485,"uid":55955,"like":52,"dislike":1,"score":51,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-09-11T11:27:38.000Z","msg":"講完等於冇講？"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-09-11T11:41:09.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/no.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/no.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n1. 哩啲野係under證券條例，即係我哋管既<br />\n<br />\n2. 我啲只會喺關我哋管既範圍既事上先會交資料<br />\n例如洗黑錢<br />\n（因為其他罪攞料就唔好問我哋）<br />\n<br />\n3. 唔識就問我哋<br />\n（唔問而又出事，就唔好賴我哋）"},{"pid":"b1bedb649042444fe777b861abb414ec8dba63ca","tid":2198485,"uid":19218,"like":44,"dislike":1,"score":43,"quote":{"pid":"16d1a1d718954a1257a92a2d7a1f0dc5ff4615c9","tid":2198485,"uid":336429,"like":17,"dislike":186,"score":-169,"quote":{"pid":"66717d91e926886879672de0145a21dd5713eaa9","tid":2198485,"uid":269481,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-09-11T11:25:37.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/news-and-announcements/news/doc?refNo=20PR88\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfc.hk%2FedistributionWeb%2Fgateway%2FEN%2Fnews-and-announcements%2Fnews%2Fdoc%3FrefNo%3D20PR88&d=lPOaXpfFeUboYNX3auI3fslSugA1I0CCabXjLbCjl00%3D&h=02fbedc9\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/news-and-announcements/news/doc?refNo=20PR88</a><br />\n<br />\nSFC statement on Police investigation concerning Next Digital shares<br />\n11 Sep 2020<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is issuing this statement in response to the numerous enquiries it has received following a press conference held by the Narcotics Bureau of the Hong Kong Police (Police) yesterday in relation to its investigation into the trading of the shares of Next Digital Limited (Next Digital).<br />\n<br />\nThe Police indicated that it is investigating suspected conspiracy to defraud and money laundering &ndash; as well as potential false trading &ndash; in the shares of Next Digital.

/>\n警務處表示，正就涉嫌串謀詐騙和洗錢以及壹傳媒股份的潛在虛假交易進行調查。虛假交易是屬於《證券及期貨條例》內市場失當行為條文下的罪行。由於證監會作為香港證券市場的監管機構，對違反《證券及期貨條例》的行為負有調查及執法的責任，基於公眾利益，本會認為需就有關事宜釐清我們的立場。<br />\n<br

/>\n就市場失當行為的罪行（例如虛假交易）而展開的調查，通常牽涉複雜的法律及證據問題，並且有需要取得有關證券市場操作、交易方式及投資者行為的專家評估。證監會已準備好回應警務處根據該諒解備忘錄就《證券及期貨條例》所訂的任何罪行而提出的任何有關這類協助的要求。<br />\n<br />\n由於調查仍在進行中，證監會無法作出進一步回應。<br />\n<br />\n完<br />\n<br

Digital shares<br />\n11 Sep 2020<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is issuing this statement in response to the numerous enquiries it has received following a press conference held by the Narcotics Bureau of the Hong Kong Police (Police) yesterday in relation to its investigation into the trading of the shares of Next Digital Limited (Next Digital).<br />\n<br />\nThe Police indicated that it is investigating suspected conspiracy to defraud and money laundering &ndash; as well as potential false trading &ndash; in the shares of Next Digital.  False trading is an offence under the market misconduct provisions of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO).  As the securities markets regulator in Hong Kong with a responsibility to investigate and enforce against breaches of the SFO, the SFC considers that it is in the public interest for it to clarify its position in relation to this matter.<br />\n<br />\nPursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Police and the SFC, both parties have committed to collaborate and cooperate to the fullest extent possible to perform their regulatory and enforcement functions effectively in relation to crimes or illicit activities relating to the securities and futures industry in Hong Kong (Note 1).  <br />\n<br />\nThe MOU contemplates the exchange and use of information, as well as other investigative assistance, where suspected criminality or misconduct falls within the functions of both the Police and the SFC. <br />\n<br />\nWhen a request is made under the MOU, the SFC will normally respond by engaging its surveillance, supervisory or investigatory powers to obtain relevant information, and will pass this information to the Police, provided that the request concerns potential offences under which both the SFC and the Police have jurisdiction, for example, money laundering.<br />\n<br />\nInvestigation into market misconduct offences, such as false trading, often involves complex questions of law and evidence, as well as the need for expert evaluation in relation to securities market functioning, trading methods and investor behaviour.  The SFC is ready to respond to any requests made by the Police under the MOU for this type of assistance in relation to any potential offences under the SFO.<br />\n<br />\nAs investigations are continuing, the SFC is not in a position to comment any further.<br />\n<br

/>\n就市場失當行為的罪行（例如虛假交易）而展開的調查，通常牽涉複雜的法律及證據問題，並且有需要取得有關證券市場操作、交易方式及投資者行為的專家評估。證監會已準備好回應警務處根據該諒解備忘錄就《證券及期貨條例》所訂的任何罪行而提出的任何有關這類協助的要求。<br />\n<br />\n由於調查仍在進行中，證監會無法作出進一步回應。<br />\n<br
