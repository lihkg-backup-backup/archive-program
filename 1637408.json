KongPollster immediately released a poll on the day of the announcement to study public&rsquo;s opinion on the regulation, and has obtained 2,048 valid responses.<br />\n<br />\nIt can be seen from the results that there has not been a significant decrease in the number of demonstrators before and after the implementation of the anti-mask law. Regardless of protesting methods, most of the demonstrators have indicated that they will continue to mask their faces despite the enactment.<br />\n<br />\nAmong 1,786 respondents who have indicated that they would participate in protests after the legislation, 45.9% said they would adopt the peaceful, rational and non-violent (PRN) protesting method, 38.2% would have radical approach, and 15.9% would adopt other methods of resistance.<br />\n<br />\nIt is notable that more than 300 respondents (i.e.18% of respondents who indicated that they will continue to participate in demonstrations) would convert from PRN to radical protesters after the enactment, reflecting the counter-effect of the new law instead of &ldquo;restoring the normal functions of the community&rdquo;, as the government spokesperson claimed. Meanwhile, as no obvious change of protest tactics is observed for the existing radical protesters after the ban, the effectiveness of the new regulation is largely doubted.<br />\n<br />\nPlease do not hesitate to like our facebook page if you appreciate our work!"},{"pid":"a96e62aaa559dc95332c820958a7b3da729f577b","tid":1637408,"uid":166947,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T03:34:26.000Z","msg":"Obviously not a smart move, people do not fear, it backfired."},{"pid":"20fda80785a90becdd8a8c70f2a7d6b083ff0f70","tid":1637408,"uid":192589,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T03:39:39.000Z","msg":"it seems returning peace today<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8eddfa2272984150d242dbd1a9721fea45677f90","tid":1637408,"uid":105894,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"20fda80785a90becdd8a8c70f2a7d6b083ff0f70","tid":1637408,"uid":192589,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T03:39:39.000Z","msg":"it seems returning peace today<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T03:42:28.000Z","msg":"Guys, we need to to make our living while protesting.
