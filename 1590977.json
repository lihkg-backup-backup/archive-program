yourself is the best option. I came to Kyoto in the company of my brother. It was a long journey and I was grateful for his company. We stayed at our friend Fuyuki's place for a few nights. We were watching television in the living room while he was cooking in the kitchen. His elder brother had just popped upstairs to get a book. His younger brother had popped to the bank to get some cash while his sister had popped into a music shop to get some saxophone scores. As he entered the living room I jumped out from behind the wall and cried &quot;Boo!&quot; It was absolutely hilarious as I was finally able to frighten him successfully. Tom popped on and visited us later. His girlfriend popped over and saw us a day later as well. They're good company. Tom said he deserved a promotion but instead his colleague was given a promotion because his boss is biased in favour of his colleague. I said that's the way the cookie crumbles. It's water under the bridge. What's done is done. My brother too said it's no use crying over spilt milk. What's done cannot be undone. Let bygones be bygones. Tom told me not to mention it when we're in company. By all means. Next week I'll pop over to his place to plays his double bass. I prefer the company of musicians. Before he popped in he was browsing in zara. In the meantime I went for a browse around a bookshop and popped into the bank to open a bank account. I enjoy my own company and so does he. The residential estate Fuyuki lives in consists of houses rather than apartments. Each house has at least one retractable awning or canopy. The canopy could be made of cloth steel glass stainless steel and concrete. In his garden he planted a lychee tree, a mango tree and bushes. He also grew lots of flowers such as orchids and roses. He mowed the grass from time to time. He occasionally hires a gardener to manicure his garden. On the day of that morning, his next-door neighbour's canopy was leaking all over the floor in his garden due to heavy rain. The water pipes attached to their stainless steel canopy was.also dripping down the wall onto his floor so he asked if he could enter their garden and wipe the water pipe and the edge of the canopy and mop then so as to stop water from leaking out of them. I too entered their garden and helped mop the edge of the canopy and water pipe to stop water from leaking from them. There was a leak in their canopy so they had a bucket underneath for the water to drop into but the bucket was overflowing all over the floor which caused flooding. Then we placed another bucket beside it but very soon water began to overflow from the bucket. I tried to soak up the water with towels but it was impossible. Water soaked into my shoes. Rain top dished through his shoes and clothes. some of his neighbors said they had a leak inside their house as well. I asked him whether the typhoon that happened a little while ago did any damage to his house. He said some tree branches and twigs tumbled down during the hurricane so they had to do a good cleanup afterwards. Some tree trunks at the park in his residential estate toppled over as a result of the hurricane. Tom called an hour later and said he finally got a promotion. The opportunity that he'd waited for so long has finally come along. Opportunities like this don't always come along. After he left zara his friend came along in his car and offered him a lift to a bar and celebrated with him. I enjoy strolling hand in hand with my girlfriend along the nearby beach. In fact I went there earlier. With only my thoughts for company I lay on the beach reading a book. It felt thoroughly enjoyable. Tom arrived on early evening. I didn't know he had company. As he was the last person to leave the house that night I kept him company until the bus came."},{"pid":"8d79819d368f84592f4eaac46f08ad64f1546c1e","tid":1590977,"uid":139100,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-24T14:13:35.000Z","msg":"京都咁大你邊度上車先？<br />\n京都站河原町嵐山都唔同"},{"pid":"45af28a68f5d62f3245bef7533f122750828cc1d","tid":1590977,"uid":1058,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"8d79819d368f84592f4eaac46f08ad64f1546c1e","tid":1590977,"uid":139100,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-24T14:13:35.000Z","msg":"京都咁大你邊度上車先？<br />\n京都站河原町嵐山都唔同"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-24T16:05:10.000Z","msg":"京都車站<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"57b0aba78bbf965966dd4d4b9dcd2e6cd7bcf8dc","tid":1590977,"uid":139100,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"45af28a68f5d62f3245bef7533f122750828cc1d","tid":1590977,"uid":1058,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"8d79819d368f84592f4eaac46f08ad64f1546c1e","tid":1590977,"uid":139100,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-24T14:13:35.000Z","msg":"京都咁大你邊度上車先？<br />\n京都站河原町嵐山都唔同"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-24T16:05:10.000Z","msg":"京都車站<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-24T16:13:18.000Z","msg":"咁點都要轉一程車了<br />\n上面有人講咗新大阪轉地鐵"},{"pid":"98ba79b6e3d36cbbac0fe7aac33145d1a4da1d59","tid":1590977,"uid":12755,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-30T12:15:38.000Z","msg":"Google map一搜就有介紹"},{"pid":"ff4d5e4b656233d4ae3f4e0f297965e28909e9ea","tid":1590977,"uid":54359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-30T15:28:22.000Z","msg":"來回京阪之間有太多鐵路<br />\n有JR，近鐵，阪急，京阪<br />\n視乎樓主去邊度<br />\n如果係京都車站，咁一定係JR<br />\n難波搭metro去梅田，再轉JR"},{"pid":"39cb90fa46d036052cc979137ba2af103bbaf120","tid":1590977,"uid":258249,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-01T12:42:13.000Z","msg":"睇你嘅起點同終點係邊<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/chicken.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n我之前由京都（七条）上大阪（淀屋橋）喺搭京阪本線<br />\n可以搭御堂筋線由淀屋橋去難波<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5e2c7792617f081be6da0eb2af28181ad18600a7","tid":1590977,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T05:41:50.000Z","msg":"it's a fair bet that the yen will continue falling over the next five months so you may as well holiday in kyoto this year. The sun has been dazzlingly bright so you might just as well have a good long soak in an outdoor onsen soaking up the sun. In fact.ive just got out of an onsen and am drying myself on a towel. My Japanese friend Fuyuki is a rabbit lover. He has a Holland lop and two Netherland dwarf rabbits. In accordance with animal law in kyoto if your pet is a social animal you must have at least two of them living together. According to the pet guide and the veterinarians you should trim your rabbit's nails every month.Rabbits are compatible with most other pets if you teach the other pets well. At tokyo university researchers undertook an experiment last year and this morning where they showed they could bond a rabbit with a dog. They were happy to find their results were compatible with the results of the study conducted last year. Hereafter Fuyuki had his rabbits and his Malamute living together. He believes he'll continue living with them in the hereafter. You can take the house rabbit journals for free and read them at your leisure. Fuyuki speaks for languages fluently. He told me &quot;because it has a jagonistic tone, instead of writing as per our previous conversation we can simply write as we discussed or as discussed. Instead of saying as per your request we can just say as you requested. Rather than say as per our agreement we can just say as we agreed.Instead of saying please find attached the receipt we can simply say attached is the receipt. Rather than say I enclose two documents herewith, it's more natural to say enclosed are two documents or I've enclosed two documents.
