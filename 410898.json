We have observed this behavior occurring both with US and UEB braille, and with both uncontracted and contracted 6-dot input. The longer the string of text entered, the more characters the translator will miss.<br />\n<br />\n2  When using the VoiceOver Actions Menu to delete a conversation from the Messages app, it is not completely removed from the list of message threads. In it's place will be left a &ldquo;broken&rdquo; item in the list which VoiceOver announces as &ldquo;null&rdquo;. Whilst in this state, the message list will not update to display or give access to any new messages; to resolve this, you will need to close the Messages app via the App Switcher. To avoid this problem, we recommend that you use the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; button to select and delete conversations and not the Actions menu.<br />\n<br />\n3. There are multiple issues when attempting to read a PDF file with VoiceOver. These issues are sporadic in nature; problems our team has identified include:<br />\nUpon opening a PDF document, the document sometimes is not seen by VoiceOver at all;<br />\n<br />\nPDF documents sometimes are not read in their entirety by VoiceOver;<br />\nAn inability to swipe around the screen to locate the beginning of a document, necessitating that VoiceOver users explore by touch or use the &ldquo;Headings&rdquo; Rotor option to attempt to locate the text; and<br />\n<br />\nAn inability to consistently navigate PDF documents by heading, even when headings are present."},{"pid":"adf345a983fecd28ff7597c79d8bbcf5882525c4","tid":410898,"uid":19454,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-09-23T10:53:54.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">Moderate Bugs</span><br />\n1  When using a braille display to edit large blocks of text, you may find that the braille cursor and VoiceOver both become sluggish if you try to move the cursor to a different place in the text.<br />\n<br />\n2 When you have both VoiceOver and Zoom enabled, you cannot enter &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; mode on the Home screen&mdash;meaning that you cannot delete or organize apps/folders.<br />\n<br />\n3  When both VoiceOver and Zoom are enabled, the behaviour of multitouch gestures (typically those which have you use 3 or 4 fingers) is inconsistent and unreliable.<br />\n4  If you use the VoiceOver Actions Menu in the App Switcher to close the app that you were just using, you will commonly find that your device will crash and respring. This does not occur if you close other apps.<br />\n<br />\n5 As of iOS 11, Home Screen icons are managed using a new &ldquo;Drag&rdquo; option accessed through the VoiceOver Actions menu. If you start performing a drag, and then use the &ldquo;Cancel Drag&rdquo; option from the Actions Menu, you will commonly find that the item initially marked for dragging ends up in a different location on the Home Screen to where it was at the start.<br />\n<br />\n6 You can no longer use the &ldquo;React&rdquo; option from the VoiceOver Actions Menu on notifications of new messages. If you use the &ldquo;More&rdquo; action to interact with a notification; the resulting page shows the message and a reply field. The Actions Menu can be accessed here on the body of the incoming message and includes &ldquo;React&rdquo;, but double-tapping on this does nothing.<br />\n<br />\n7 After using the &ldquo;More&rdquo; option from the VoiceOver Actions menu on a Lock Screen notification, you may find on occasions that 1 or more other notifications which were previously listed on the Lock Screen are now gone."},{"pid":"894550a120a8108af8c239724d8fe38ca5a4f1dc","tid":410898,"uid":12994,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-09-23T10:54:55.000Z","msg":"你不如翻譯做中文先<br />\n咁先多人認同你"},{"pid":"79339cafe55b74b392cb922f822cc2187a0bae76","tid":410898,"uid":19454,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-09-23T10:56:18.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">Minor Bugs</span><br />\n1 When on the Lock Screen or Cover Sheet (formerly the Notifications Centre), flicking up or down with 1 finger on the &ldquo;Page x of 3&rdquo; control no longer moves you between pages. The control itself will change (for example, from &ldquo;Page 2 of 3&rdquo; to &ldquo;Page 1 of 3&rdquo;, etc.), but the page itself does not change.<br />\n<br />\n2 When VoiceOver speaks a notification when it initially arrives, you may find that on occasions part of that announcement will be &ldquo;in 1 minute&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;now&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\n3 If you are playing audio through an external device, the &ldquo;Playback Destination&rdquo; button on the Mini Player screen of the native Music app no longer includes the name of the destination device (although this information is visually present on screen, it is not spoken by VoiceOver).<br />\n<br />\n4 In the Files app that is new in iOS 11, the VoiceOver Actions Menu for files and folders includes two separate instances of &ldquo;Delete&rdquo;. In some instances, one of these will be &ldquo;Delete Now&rdquo;; on other occasions, both will be &ldquo;Delete&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\n5 After performing a search in the App Store, VoiceOver will behave as if the list of Trending Searches is present at the end of the list of search results. This is not the case; this list is not visually present on screen, and apps reported by VoiceOver as being in this list cannot be accessed. Note that the list of Trending Searches is present and works as expected before you perform a search.<br />\n<br />\n6 When you first go to the Apps; Games; or Updates tab in the App Store, you should find a &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; button near the top of this page. However, if you swipe some way through the list of apps shown on this page, you will find that this button can no longer be located (either by swiping or touch). To temporarily resolve this issue, we recommend that you double-tap with 1 finger on the Status Bar.<br />\n<br />\n7 When reading text that includes the &ldquo;&pound;&rdquo; symbol, VoiceOver speaks this in the form of &ldquo;Pound Sign 10&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;10 Pounds&rdquo; (note that this is the symbol for the UK currency).<br />\n<br />\n8 On the Emergency SOS settings screen (Settings &gt; Emergency SOS), there is an unlabeled element immediately after the &ldquo;Emergency SOS&rdquo; heading. This is a graphic showing the location of the Power button, but it is not spoken at all by VoiceOver.<br />\n<br />\nOn occasions, audio will begin to break up and &ldquo;crackle&rdquo; (this has been seen with the device's internal speaker, and when playing audio through a connected speaker or headset). We have found that toggling VoiceOver off and back on again will typically resolve this issue.<br />\nVoiceOver no longer provides feedback when using the physical buttons on a device to change volume.<br />\n<br />\nWhen bluetooth is enabled, but no devices are connected, VoiceOver will announce &ldquo;Bluetooth Connected&rdquo; when focus is placed on the bluetooth icon in the Status Bar. In this scenario, VoiceOver should preferably announce &ldquo;Bluetooth On&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nThis behavior itself is not new in iOS, but we have detected what we believe to be a slight increase in the frequency of voiceOver becoming unresponsive and needing to be restarted to resume normal working behavior. In particular, it seems more common that spoken output from VoiceOver will stop, but the other VoiceOver sound effects continue."},{"pid":"5a578c2ea0290cea2d823e097e6eb266c2189a9c","tid":410898,"uid":19454,"like":1,"dislike":2,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-09-23T11:03:23.000Z","msg":"太長，唔貼了"},{"pid":"f27b3f3515a38e78963eb0b4674898738eec9f2c","tid":410898,"uid":24660,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-09-23T11:08:21.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>太長，唔貼了</blockquote><br
