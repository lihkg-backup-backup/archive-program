Republicans&rsquo; Perception of the Brand Has Dropped, Data Shows<br />\nBy Todd Spangler  <br />\nTodd Spangler<br />\n<br />\nHollywood&rsquo;s left-leaning politics has made the industry a b&ecirc;te noire among conservatives for decades. But Netflix has made some recent moves that have especially rankled Republicans.<br />\n<br />\nIn March, the streamer named Susan Rice &mdash; former national security adviser to President Obama, and a conservative target in the Bengazi scandal &mdash; to its board of directors. Last month, Netflix officially announced an exclusive multiyear deal with the Obamas&rsquo; Higher Ground Productions for original programming. And last week, it premiered &ldquo;The Break with Michelle Wolf&rdquo; &mdash; a late-night-style show from the comedian who delivered a blistering takedown of the Trump administration and other conservative politicos at the White House Correspondents Association dinner.<br />\n<br />\nThousands of right-wingers have taken to social media to express their unhappiness with Netflix&rsquo;s left turns. They&rsquo;ve condemned Netflix, announced they have dropped the streaming service, and urged like-minded folks to also cancel.<br />\n<br />\nHow much has Netflix alienated the right? New data from YouGov, a brand-perception research firm, indicates that Netflix&rsquo;s positive-impression rating among Republicans in the U.S. has drifted down 16% from the beginning of 2018 through May 31, according to data from YouGov&rsquo;s BrandIndex. At the same time, Netflix&rsquo;s approval rating with Democrats has risen 15% over the same time period (see chart, below).<br />\n<br />\nThat said, Netflix maintains a relatively high favorability rating &mdash; even among Americans who identify as Republicans. YouGov BrandIndex&rsquo;s Impression survey measures overall perception on a scale of -100 to 100, and Netflix is in firm positive territory across the political spectrum.<br />\n<br />\nIndeed, Netflix is the No. 2 most popular TV network overall tracked by YouGov (based data from Nov. 10, 2017-May 28, 2018), ranking behind only Discovery. For 2017, Netflix had the second-highest average &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; score after Amazon, per YouGov&rsquo;s measurement of week-to-week consumer reactions brands &mdash; ahead of Nike, Apple and M&amp;M&rsquo;s. Netflix also is No. 7 among brands people say they&rsquo;d be &ldquo;proud&rdquo; to work for on YouGov&rsquo;s 2018 workforce ranking.<br />\n<br />\nAll the same, the 21-point differential in Netflix&rsquo;s brand perception scores as of May 31 between Dems (62.8) and GOP-ers (41.8) on YouGov&rsquo;s Impression survey is telling.<br />\n<br />\nNetflix declined to comment on the YouGov results. (The company typically does not weigh in on third-party data.)<br />\n<br />\nFor now, it&rsquo;s difficult to definitively gauge the scope of the #CancelNetflix conservative backlash, and whether that will put any kind of dent in its subscriber momentum. Ted Sarandos, Netflix&rsquo;s chief content officer &mdash; who has personal ties to Democratic figures &mdash; has suggested critics wait for the actual content that emerges from the Obamas&rsquo; production company before passing judgment.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;This is not The Obama Network,&rdquo; said Sarandos, speaking at the Paley Center for Media in New York on May 29. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no political slant to the programming.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://img.eservice-hk.net/upload/2018/06/05/110500_2bb4d0dabb0714f8ff6427e0e310aa0e.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.eservice-hk.net%2Fupload%2F2018%2F06%2F05%2F110500_2bb4d0dabb0714f8ff6427e0e310aa0e.png&h=4c747fe4&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"024ee21750cb4a121129f6dd95cab7ca6bf38a7a","tid":690529,"uid":134071,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T03:05:57.000Z","msg":"The disavowal by Sarandos that the Obamas will not produce content with a political agenda has not gone over well with conservatives who harbor an intractable enmity toward the 44th U.S. president.<br />\n<br />\nAnd Sarandos&rsquo; statements are fairly disingenuous. While Higher Ground probably won&rsquo;t produce a documentary, say, exploring the FBI&rsquo;s probe of the Trump campaign&rsquo;s potential ties to Russia, the content is expected to have a progressive worldview. One idea that&rsquo;s brewing is for a Netflix show hosted by Barack Obama discussing health care, voting rights, immigration, foreign policy, and climate change, per a New York Times report.<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile, &ldquo;The Break with Michelle Wolf,&rdquo; the weekly half-hour variety/sketch series with new episodes streaming every Sunday, certainly isn&rsquo;t helping Netflix win over any conservative fans. In her June 3 segment, Wolf delivers this zinger: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t compare Trump to an ape &mdash; because that&rsquo;s rude to apes! Compared to Trump, apes are quite accomplished!&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nTo put this into perspective, Netflix&rsquo;s politically charged content is just a tiny fraction of the stuff it pumps out. I&rsquo;m guessing most customers probably don&rsquo;t care about the board appointment of Susan Rice &mdash; or even know who she is. And through its relationship with the Obamas, Netflix is calculating that the appeal of the ex-First Couple will outweigh upsetting any haters.<br />\n<br />\nThen there&rsquo;s this important point: Netflix is a global service, operating in more than 190 countries. Barack Obama left office last year with very high worldwide approval ratings: an average of 76% of respondents in 24 countries said he was a good president, according to research firm Ipsos. Asked about Trump, 66% said they believed he would be a bad president.<br />\n<br />\nPictured above: Netflix&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Break with Michelle Wolf&rdquo;"},{"pid":"d43495aee156ca7ae589fbdc1d0ca242005cdb13","tid":690529,"uid":134071,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T05:06:11.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"feb7a5515f2ab7357833fbbc1f1d7d954d8d5f43","tid":690529,"uid":180124,"like":0,"dislike":4,"score":-4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T05:07:10.000Z","msg":"試用過，冇野睇既"},{"pid":"b694d0d9035ea6e7bd97a891d92030bd05199031","tid":690529,"uid":60787,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T05:07:44.000Z","msg":"成個美國影視業都中哂左膠毒啦"},{"pid":"a7e1cc8c2b6725c1cf656863bc2576e16cb432b8","tid":690529,"uid":100863,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"quote":{"pid":"feb7a5515f2ab7357833fbbc1f1d7d954d8d5f43","tid":690529,"uid":180124,"like":0,"dislike":4,"score":-4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T05:07:10.000Z","msg":"試用過，冇野睇既"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T05:09:07.000Z","msg":"Netflix 都冇野睇你平時睇開咩？"},{"pid":"5db9ed3c6d0022c1e257006219b1e8bdb9b115e4","tid":690529,"uid":129601,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a7e1cc8c2b6725c1cf656863bc2576e16cb432b8","tid":690529,"uid":100863,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"quote":{"pid":"feb7a5515f2ab7357833fbbc1f1d7d954d8d5f43","tid":690529,"uid":180124,"like":0,"dislike":4,"score":-4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T05:07:10.000Z","msg":"試用過，冇野睇既"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T05:09:07.000Z","msg":"Netflix 都冇野睇你平時睇開咩？"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T05:14:57.000Z","msg":"Netflix 自家劇大部分都唔好睇<br />\n啲戲又好舊下，<br />\n近期係得套碳變睇得下<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"421b06eb2ded60c445462e5de032547896f7cd4e","tid":690529,"uid":17672,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T05:16:01.000Z","msg":"睇左兩集david letterman個節目 左到PK<br />\n<br />\n見第三集仲要係馬拉拉 即刻唔想睇"}]}
