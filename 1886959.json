The Chinese authorities had objected to its headline, which read, &ldquo;China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nChinese officials have &ldquo;demanded that The Wall Street Journal recognize the seriousness of the error, openly and formally apologize, and investigate and punish those responsible, while retaining the need to take further measures against the newspaper,&rdquo; Geng Shuang, the ministry spokesman, said in a transcript provided by the Chinese government.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and smear China with malicious attacks,&rdquo; he added.<br />\n<br />\nThe Journal identified the reporters as Josh Chin, its deputy bureau chief in Beijing and an American national; Chao Deng, an American; and Philip Wen, an Australian national.<br />\n<br />\nA spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Company, publisher of The Journal, did not have an immediate comment.<br />\n<br />\nLike other media organizations, including The New York Times, The Journal runs its news and editorial departments as separate operations, meaning none of the newspaper&rsquo;s reporters in China would have been involved in writing the essay&rsquo;s headline.<br />\n<br />\nThe move comes just months after Chinese officials effectively expelled another Journal reporter, Chun Han Wong, from mainland China. Officials did not provide a reason, but the expulsion came after he co-wrote an article about a cousin of China&rsquo;s top leader, Xi Jinping.<br />\n<br />\nIt also comes less than one day after American officials in Washington said they would treat five government-controlled Chinese news organizations &mdash; Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily and People&rsquo;s Daily &mdash; as foreign government functionaries, subject to similar rules as diplomats stationed in the United States.<br />\n<br />\nThe opinion piece with the &ldquo;Sick Man&rdquo; headline was written by Walter Russell Mead, a professor at Bard College. It criticized China's initial response to the coronavirus outbreak as well as the state of the country&rsquo;s financial markets.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/business/media/china-wall-street-journal.html?referringSource=articleShare\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F02%2F19%2Fbusiness%2Fmedia%2Fchina-wall-street-journal.html%3FreferringSource%3DarticleShare&d=WZLdF6k3LRQ%2Bb7h5E4OoDsZCnWmYDHHppvVe94ioujI%3D&h=11440d2d\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/business/media/china-wall-street-journal.html?referringSource=articleShare</a>"},{"pid":"0ea8dd8ff0f62deb521eb7daea9576cbf70c6040","tid":1886959,"uid":288601,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T08:58:18.000Z","msg":"Pish"},{"pid":"24d35ebdace7a5a3b5078b5bcec55c1b532c5886","tid":1886959,"uid":288601,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T08:58:28.000Z","msg":"Pish 2"},{"pid":"a3fde69317ecf08b592f04463ca36c169690bbac","tid":1886959,"uid":288601,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T08:58:39.000Z","msg":"Useless pish 3"},{"pid":"91774d1fb67824613179657799dc3a57bb29ca5e","tid":1886959,"uid":288601,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T08:58:49.000Z","msg":"Pish 4"},{"pid":"d67972b643b6e0da2231310933d67ff5cd1e5b41","tid":1886959,"uid":288601,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T08:59:04.000Z","msg":"Pish 5"},{"pid":"6f820b796603950e2480bddcdebb062e1afbd637","tid":1886959,"uid":288601,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T08:59:14.000Z","msg":"Push 6"},{"pid":"81874a758257a07b57712e37d821b2e8d8b63004","tid":1886959,"uid":288601,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T08:59:29.000Z","msg":"Push 7"},{"pid":"3f463e4186e6e6073b3dc44ed972696481860a91","tid":1886959,"uid":288601,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T08:59:39.000Z","msg":"Push 8"},{"pid":"565cf2462245f115535205d279306cda82d88ca4","tid":1886959,"uid":288601,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T08:59:49.000Z","msg":"Push 9"},{"pid":"89bf73e112f93734b3cb6581d1a9f56ea6494931","tid":1886959,"uid":288601,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T09:00:00.000Z","msg":"Push 100000"},{"pid":"b52e50dbbcadd9ba87391e90443d802311ae5f3c","tid":1886959,"uid":249263,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T09:14:57.000Z","msg":"仲有依度<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n【19/2 twitter *極度*要人】美國議員全方位怒插中共<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1886899\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1886899</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"5dd28fcc02348cf135c8103030c9dfcae0de051e","tid":1886959,"uid":145496,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T09:16:40.000Z","msg":"NYT已成condom <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5cde72cbe2bff8b4aa7e85644b523cc47a43b90c","tid":1886959,"uid":3149,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T09:34:50.000Z","msg":"Push <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
