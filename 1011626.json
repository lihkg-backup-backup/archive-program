She also confirmed that, for the first time in decades, the awards will go hostless. That change, Burke insisted, would allow &ldquo;the presenters and the movies be the stars. That&rsquo;s the best way to keep the show to a brisk three hours.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nAs Burke noted, such promises have been made in the past, including with last year&rsquo;s telecast. That show, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, ran for nearly four hours, and concluded with Best Picture being handed to The Shape of Water. About 26.5 million viewers in the United States tuned in for the event, making for the lowest-watched Academy Awards ceremony in history.<br />\n<br />\nWhile that was a devastating number, it was hardly a surprise, as ratings for the annual show have been on the decline for several years. The Oscars hit a modern peak in 1998, when the telecast attracted about 57 million stateside viewers, thanks in no small part to the presence of Titanic. A few years later, in 2001, nearly 43 million U.S. viewers tuned in to watch Gladiator win Best Picture. Such numbers seem unattainable now, as recent broadcasts have barely beaten the 40-million-viewer mark.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>To keep viewers interested this year, ABC is considering some radical changes. Some of the less celeb-heavy categories will likely be dropped from the televised portion of the show, though it hasn&rsquo;t been announced which ones will be cut</strong>. And for the first time since 1989, the show won&rsquo;t have a dedicated host: Kevin Hart accepted the job last year, only to abandon the gig following an uproar over several of the comedian&rsquo;s controversial tweets.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/02/05/the-2019-oscars-date-host/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2019%2F02%2F05%2Fthe-2019-oscars-date-host%2F&d=8mXO1VLy4U8nFH7Q%2FrHVYPpmn865KX7g3oX29oYbiiE%3D&h=9bb1251c\" target=\"_blank\">http://fortune.com/2019/02/05/the-2019-oscars-date-host/</a>"},{"pid":"9befd806e17a7bed47094195121238ce300ff61e","tid":1011626,"uid":171082,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T02:32:57.000Z","msg":"會唔會比人話唔專重某些製作單位同員工<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"90158c1ea6d4356496d2929e07ff58991df6e570","tid":1011626,"uid":44171,"like":4,"dislike":1,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T02:33:13.000Z","msg":"#metoo 又有新話題<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"9bc93a22705266cd335003398c1d84820d5f4540","tid":1011626,"uid":41343,"like":6,"dislike":1,"score":5,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T02:34:16.000Z","msg":"點睇荷里活忙住表揚不同種族不同性取向女權反Trump<br />\n<br />\n但係無辦法表揚業內人士？"},{"pid":"ab0bd1bb4dec7ac705f3ce8bff16b1fa35d1ec86","tid":1011626,"uid":191352,"like":10,"dislike":0,"score":10,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T02:34:40.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"7c242fdbb27512186d9db0617fe2c0778626dd25","tid":1011626,"uid":146243,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T02:36:14.000Z","msg":"咁啱嗰啲時間係一個黑人/女人/變性人拎 成班左膠又係度嘈<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/pig2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"02f23cda055e078799a837278b2bc8e7f59d727c","tid":1011626,"uid":103230,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T02:38:51.000Z","msg":"衰過以前tvb<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"38c3e6927a76c5544c5aeca6920c523a20fc243c","tid":1011626,"uid":41343,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T02:40:45.000Z","msg":"The Oscars hit a modern peak in 1998, when the telecast attracted about 57 million stateside viewers, thanks in no small part to the presence of Titanic.<br />\n<br />\n為左救收視，做馬都做俾黑豹拎Best Pic 啦咁"},{"pid":"c9bfe85581e90163f82feb1564148daf373e5c64","tid":1011626,"uid":149494,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T02:41:22.000Z","msg":"仲有人關注呢d濕鳩頒獎禮<br />\n一定係由個主持opening monologue開始,到每個頒獎嘉賓同得獎者都響到吹奏黑人、女權、同性戀, 平等大愛, 反metoo, 反trump是但一樣<br />\n如果Meryl Streep響度, 吹奏女權嗰陣就一定要Meryl Streep拍哂手掌, 起埋身咁支持<br />\n未睇都估撚到"},{"pid":"3de19082f10cb910c35417fdfde5d20b5a60c76e","tid":1011626,"uid":217451,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"c9bfe85581e90163f82feb1564148daf373e5c64","tid":1011626,"uid":149494,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T02:41:22.000Z","msg":"仲有人關注呢d濕鳩頒獎禮<br />\n一定係由個主持opening monologue開始,到每個頒獎嘉賓同得獎者都響到吹奏黑人、女權、同性戀, 平等大愛, 反metoo, 反trump是但一樣<br />\n如果Meryl Streep響度, 吹奏女權嗰陣就一定要Meryl Streep拍哂手掌, 起埋身咁支持<br />\n未睇都估撚到"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T02:46:08.000Z","msg":"梅E今年無提名"},{"pid":"332911ac3a1d81a56968088564e9079d32c73ae0","tid":1011626,"uid":132587,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T02:54:17.000Z","msg":"奧斯卡同成個荷里活演藝圈一樣<br />\n愈黎愈嘔心<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/ass.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a53551e2c70c7c09d84a7117c8b81d03181b9586","tid":1011626,"uid":64191,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-07T03:02:53.000Z","msg":"金球仲好睇過奧斯卡"}]}
