Why do you think people attend colleges or universities?<br />\n<br />\nYou should give reasons for your answer using your own ideas and experience.<br />\n<br />\nWrite at least 250 words.<br />\n<br />\n----------<br />\n<br />\nNowadays, more and more people tend to receive tertiary education instead of leaving schools after secondary education. The reasons why they prefer going to colleges or universities will be discussed in this essay.<br />\n<br />\nFirst of all, many people tend to receive tertiary education because of career needs. Since our society has been evolving into a knowledge-based economy, a lot of jobs on the market require jobseekers to have tertiary education level. For example, high-paying professional jobs like doctors or lawyers require candidates to have at least a degree in their respective disciplines. In this connection, people are more eager to attend colleges or universities in order to enhance their competitiveness on the job market. <br />\n<br />\nSecond, some people have a great desire for knowledge, so they would like to continue their pursuit in the academic field in tertiary educational institutes. For example, a student who is intrigued in science may want to study physics, chemistry or other similar science subjects in the university.<br />\n<br />\nLast but not least, we should not underestimate the effect of government&rsquo;s promotion on tertiary education. In order to prepare the population for the knowledge-based economy, the government has been encouraging people to receive tertiary education through a number of measures, such as establishing more colleges and universities as well as providing financial support for the students who have difficulties in affording tuition. With relevant promotional policy implemented by the government, people are more eager to attend colleges or universities.  <br />\n<br />\nTo conclude, I think people tend to receive tertiary education for different reasons. No matter what the reason is, I always think that going to colleges or universities is a wise choice because they are the places which help us to grow. <br />\n<br />\n(284 words)<br />\n<br

In order to prepare the population for the knowledge-based economy, the government has been encouraging people to receive tertiary education through a number of measures, such as establishing more colleges and universities as well as providing financial support for the students who have difficulties in affording tuition. With relevant promotional policy implemented by the government, people are more eager to attend colleges or universities.  <br />\n<br />\nTo conclude, I think people tend to receive tertiary education for different reasons. No matter what the reason is, I always think that going to colleges or universities is a wise choice because they are the places which help us to grow. <br />\n<br />\n(284 words)<br />\n<br />\n目標係7.5分<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T10:51:13.000Z","msg":"7.5不了 clumsy <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T11:01:53.000Z","msg":"少少自改<br />\n<br />\nWith relevant promotional <span style=\"color: green;\">policies in place</span>"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T11:03:06.000Z","msg":"小弟愚見 <br />\n你呢個level dse嚟計4-5之間<br />\nIELTS嚟計 6.5-7"},{"pid":"278c7621bfc2de5db147c22607174c9f39f880c1","tid":747906,"uid":132461,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"65f615cf3d67b32adbee130c4f19040edfbef78e","tid":747906,"uid":189234,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"quote":{"pid":"0e36c3639c2bf14d858251317de3a57c3867cb8d","tid":747906,"uid":132461,"like":7,"dislike":0,"score":7,"quote":{"pid":"192dcd998e03e76ac878c8eee38fb9cd5767c8e3","tid":747906,"uid":132461,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-07-21T12:53:50.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://img.eservice-hk.net/upload/2018/07/21/205339_4a47a0db6e60853dedfcfdf08a5ca249.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.eservice-hk.net%2Fupload%2F2018%2F07%2F21%2F205339_4a47a0db6e60853dedfcfdf08a5ca249.png&h=1963c065&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nI will try to write a passage for this IELTS past paper probably on tomorrow."},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-07-23T11:00:24.000Z","msg":"Our world nowadays has been heavily influenced by capitalism. We can hardly escape from advertisements in our daily lives. With time, we are gradually inculcated with the concept that we can only be happy through material possessions and social success. Therefore, I largely agree that people&rsquo;s worth nowadays seems to mainly depend on their social status and material possessions, instead of the traditional values such as honour and kindness. <br />\n<br />\nWhenever we make new friends or chat with our relatives in some annual gatherings, we will commonly be asked about our occupations, and will be judged whether we are successful or not according to our answers. People are not interested to know if you are a honorable or kind person, because they tend to judge you by your occupation which reflects your income level and social status. If you tell someone that you have a professional job like a doctor or lawyer, they will immediately show admiration to you. On the contrary, if you tell someone that you have a blue-collar job, they will probably be not interested in you, or even look down on you. <br />\n<br />\nWhile the above tendency is prevalent in Hong Kong, I will try to keep myself from being affected by it, because I think integrity, kindness and trust are important values which should not be ignored. I still believe that these traditional values can bring us true happiness. For example, you cannot build a close relationship without trust. My conclusion is that we should never desert the traditional values, and should learn to understand the importance of them. Otherwise, we will be drowned in the materialistic world where true happiness can never be found."},"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2018-07-24T14:30:08.000Z","msg":"In my humble opinion, you should work on brevity. <br />\nLet me try to rewrite your first paragraph by using your ideas. <br />\n<br />\nAs we live in the age of capitalism, commercial advertisements are literally omnipresent. We are inculcated with the value that materialism is the only way to happiness. I largely agree that social status and material possessions have unfortunately become the sole measurements of a person's worth. <br />\n<br />\nLikewise, I think your second paragraph can be
