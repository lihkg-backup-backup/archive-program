Others who supposedly jumped off buildings were coerced or thrown off. These tactics are widespread in mainland China, as the Police, security and military apparatus are used to track, and hunt democracy activists, Falun Dafa Practitioners, Christians, Tibetans, Uighur&rsquo;s, and other ethnic groups. The captured are sent to police stations, detention centers, reeducation labor camps, and concentration camps. Suicides are almost always the declaration of the Chinese Socialist Regime. They are subject to torture, rape, and organ trafficking which leads to their murder. <a href=\"https://hu.endorganpillaging.org/an-update/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhu.endorganpillaging.org%2Fan-update%2F&d=6p%2BW5B2gHvlBGPj8iPYwcj6T6zfZKY9%2BYzH6xvUt7sk%3D&h=798062ef\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://hu.endorganpillaging.org/an-update/</a>"},{"pid":"6741f39de730c2cf47c753678c864a08a73bb1b6","tid":1646085,"uid":90704,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-11T06:59:40.000Z","msg":"AI Data Extraction Leads to Embedding Spies to Capture HongKong Citizens<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong Students are hunted Through Facial Recognition, and tracking software embedded in smart phones and apps as they connect to the internet. The AI software provided by big tech in the west has these capabilities built in the system. The Chinese regime has embedded spies in Hong Kong Police, reporters, schools, clubs, and practically everywhere in Hong Kong. They were able to do this by using bio-metric tools assessed by Artificial Intelligence gathered by their data pool. After acquiring some data, they are able to place their spies, people of influence and those who commit sabotage and rape, within the populous. This method is also a data gathering strategy, as China has thousands of years of history and skill in tactic or war, diffusion and penetration. There are stages to their plans, tactics and responses. With the incorporation of AI, it has strengthened their espionage and war capabilities greatly, because of Western Big Tech Greed and irresponsibility of their Hired Engineers.<br />\n<br />\nTo really understand the gravity of this situation, and the global interconnection, read, AI, Trump, China &amp; The Weaponization of Robotics with 5G.<br />\n<br />\nCyrus A.
