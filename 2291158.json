Johnston saw in Hollywood the opportunity to shape the perceptions of America domestically and internationally, seeing that &ldquo;the motion picture industry is the most powerful medium for the influencing of people that man has ever built&rdquo; and that Hollywood could, in effect, help to reinvent America by helping to shape a new popular consensus of American life. This new &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; was rooted not in regionalism or the differences in Americans that were celebrated in the 1920s&mdash;when jazz was the hot trend&mdash;and 1930s&mdash;when ethnic actors such as Will Rogers and James Cagney dominated Hollywood&mdash;but, rather, in uniformity. Johnston, knowing that films were now being shipped to post-war Europe, believed films should show a united country rooted in consumerism, not films such as The Grapes of Wrath, which showed what he called &ldquo;the seamy side of American life.&rdquo; To that end, he encouraged movies that celebrated American myth and, especially, American opportunity. And while Hollywood did produce some exceptions by and large, films produced between 1946 and 1967 (the beginning of the so-called &ldquo;New Hollywood&rdquo; with the release of Bonnie and Clyde and The Graduate) suggest an idealized America rooted in traditional values, standard gender roles, and a belief in capitalism and the family.<br />\n<br />\nTake 1946&rsquo;s It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life, for instance. Even though there is a corrupt banker in the film, the good deeds of the main character save the day and rid the bank of its past corruption, allowing for a glorious American future. Or, for another example, try 1948&rsquo;s Fort Apache, a Western that both proves the myth of Custer&rsquo;s Last Stand to be, well, a myth, while also celebrating that myth. The film ends with the hero figure describing the greatness of the Custer-esque colonel that is the film&rsquo;s central bad guy. Why? Because the myth of America is ultimately more important than the truth. This is exactly the sort of message Johnston endorsed, for, ultimately, Johnston was far more concerned with showing an idealized country than a realized one."},{"pid":"1102191fb412da426582f0ec2bc927e6a3af8aba","tid":2291158,"uid":38904,"like":7,"dislike":8,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T14:16:31.000Z","msg":"0/100"},{"pid":"91661fb6bd89190fc6b59d7c9c57ad782848570c","tid":2291158,"uid":346584,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T14:53:16.000Z","msg":"became president of what would become the MPAA<br />\n咩黎<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/scare.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e09641df57d3e3f00f53a04d9b5782cc90e921bc","tid":2291158,"uid":47901,"like":1,"dislike":2,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"91661fb6bd89190fc6b59d7c9c57ad782848570c","tid":2291158,"uid":346584,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T14:53:16.000Z","msg":"became president of what would become the MPAA<br />\n咩黎<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/scare.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T19:00:38.000Z","msg":"&quot;Right after World War II, Eric Johnston, former President of the United States Chamber of Commerce, became president of what would become the MPAA.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n咁改ok?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nRight after World War II, Eric Johnston, who had retired as President of the United States Chamber of Commerce, was named president of MPAA in 1946."},{"pid":"55dc19041fd9f450cacb38b070b8de7451a26ae1","tid":2291158,"uid":276779,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"quote":{"pid":"e09641df57d3e3f00f53a04d9b5782cc90e921bc","tid":2291158,"uid":47901,"like":1,"dislike":2,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"91661fb6bd89190fc6b59d7c9c57ad782848570c","tid":2291158,"uid":346584,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T14:53:16.000Z","msg":"became president of what would become the MPAA<br />\n咩黎<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/scare.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T19:00:38.000Z","msg":"&quot;Right after World War II, Eric Johnston, former President of the United States Chamber of Commerce, became president of what would become the MPAA.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n咁改ok?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nRight after World War II, Eric Johnston, who had retired as President of the United States Chamber of Commerce, was named president of MPAA in 1946."},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T20:36:05.000Z","msg":"Was named president <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"13eb0821231d80d80180fa4716d842cd1cd53b62","tid":2291158,"uid":276779,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T20:36:44.000Z","msg":"Johnston saw in Hollywood the opportunity to shape the perceptions of America domestically and internationally<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n睇到依度睇唔落去，1999"},{"pid":"bfccdcf6c54cd1e30fb9214bad02db9362e3747c","tid":2291158,"uid":47901,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"13eb0821231d80d80180fa4716d842cd1cd53b62","tid":2291158,"uid":276779,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T20:36:44.000Z","msg":"Johnston saw in Hollywood the opportunity to shape the perceptions of America domestically and internationally<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n睇到依度睇唔落去，1999"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T21:20:33.000Z","msg":"咁改ok?<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nJohnston realized and seized the opportunity to improve the perception of Unite States of people worldwide by Hollywood movies.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nJohnston realized and seized the opportunity to repute Unite States to people worldwide by Hollywood movies."},{"pid":"6eb7fc0d23c44b3ed7bc0a8385f442de572d89aa","tid":2291158,"uid":263025,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"f52bf4bfbf8e5241a0dbe313cad511b5a8ba32e9","tid":2291158,"uid":382419,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T14:15:44.000Z","msg":"History of the American Motion Picture<br />\n<br />\nRight after World War II, Eric Johnston, former President of the United States Chamber of Commerce, became president of what would become the MPAA.

American Motion Picture<br />\n<br />\nRight after World War II, Eric Johnston, former President of the United States Chamber of Commerce, became president of <span class=\"red\">&quot;****&quot;</span>, <del>what would become</del> the<span class=\"red\"> then</span> MPAA. Johnston saw in Hollywood the opportunity to shape the perceptions of America domestically and internationally, <del>seeing</del> <span class=\"red\">realizing</span> that &ldquo;the motion picture industry is the most powerful medium for the influencing of people that man has ever built&rdquo; and that Hollywood could <del>, in effect, help</del> <span class=\"red\">be an effective way </span>to reinvent America by <del>helping to shape</del> <span class=\"red\">illustrating</span> a new popular consensus of American life. This new &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; was rooted not in regionalism or the differences in Americans that were celebrated in the 1920s&mdash;when jazz was the hot trend&mdash;and 1930s&mdash;when ethnic actors such as Will Rogers and James Cagney dominated Hollywood&mdash;but, rather, in uniformity. Johnston, knowing that films were <del>now</del> <span class=\"red\">at the time</span> being shipped to post-war Europe, believed films should <del>show</del> <span class=\"red\">depict</span> a united country rooted in consumerism, not films such as The Grapes of Wrath, which showed what he called &ldquo;the seamy side of American life.&rdquo; To that end, he encouraged <del>movies</del> <span class=\"red\">creations</span> that celebrated American myth and, especially, American opportunity. And while Hollywood did produce some exceptions by and large, films produced between 1946 and 1967 (the beginning of the so-called &ldquo;New Hollywood&rdquo; with the release of Bonnie and Clyde and The Graduate) suggest an idealized America rooted in traditional values, standard gender roles, and a belief in capitalism and the family.<br />\n<br />\nTake 1946&rsquo;s It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life, for instance. <del>Even though there is a corrupt banker in the film</del> <span class=\"red\">Notwithstanding the corrupt banker as the antagonist</span>, the good deeds of the main character <span class=\"red\">saved</span> the day and <del>rid</del> <span class=\"red\">salvaged</span> the bank <del>of</del> <span class=\"red\">from</span> its past corruption, allowing for a glorious American future. <del>Or, for</del> <span class=\"red\">A</span>nother example, try 1948&rsquo;s Fort Apache, a Western that <del>both</del> proves the myth of Custer&rsquo;s Last Stand to be, well, a myth, while also celebrating that myth. The film ends with the hero figure <span class=\"red\">reminiscing</span> <del>describing</del> the greatness of the Custer-esque colonel that is the film&rsquo;s <span class=\"red\">primary villain</span> <del>central bad guy</del>. Why? Because the myth of America is ultimately more important than the truth. This is exactly the sort of message Johnston endorsed, for, <del>ultimately</del><span class=\"red\"> at the end of the day</span>, Johnston was far more concerned with showing an idealized country than a realized one.</blockquote><br />\n<br />\n求期執下  大佬唔好咁多斷句 睇死人"},{"pid":"91c6c4b47db66ba9570a50f5e49ac3cc7597b01d","tid":2291158,"uid":271049,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"f0d68ba4b2107d5a39acb53619d5b820d30eecca","tid":2291158,"uid":276779,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"quote":{"pid":"2d0dc9a6b8ab5eba87ad18d9d343417dee0f4042","tid":2291158,"uid":271049,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"55dc19041fd9f450cacb38b070b8de7451a26ae1","tid":2291158,"uid":276779,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-11-18T20:36:05.000Z","msg":"Was named president <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-11-19T02:12:58.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-11-19T02:18:27.000Z","msg":"was named <span class=\"red\"><span class=\"x-large\">as</span></span> president 呀<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n冇咗preposition 呀<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-19T09:13:53.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bomb.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ecfbc4034edd3f1bb69e3ad89b51a3a640e4005a","tid":2291158,"uid":67717,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-19T11:31:38.000Z","msg":"This is very impressive and well done.
