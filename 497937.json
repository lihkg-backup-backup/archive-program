From my vantage point on the towpath, the bridge&rsquo;s brushed-steel curves rose and dipped over the river before disappearing into a thick cluster of privet. <span style=\"color: red;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">I watched passersby stroll over. Most peeped and retreated. The more brazen continued, swallowed by the hedges into one of London&rsquo;s most fascinating enclaves.</span></span><br />\nThis is Eel Pie Island, one of around 180 river islets &ndash; known as &lsquo;eyots&rsquo; or &lsquo;aits&rsquo;  &ndash; on the Thames, born of the river&rsquo;s meandering, 184-mile path from the Cotswold hills to the North Sea.<br />\nYou may also be interested in:<br />\n&bull; London&rsquo;s most welcoming neighbourhood?<br />\n&bull; The town that predicted the world&rsquo;s end<br />\n&bull; London&rsquo;s secret underground mail rail<br />\nMudbanks like Chiswick Eyot, a thickly-wooded nature reserve populated by herons and Canada geese, were sculpted on the river&rsquo;s route. At high tide the tiny piece of land is swallowed whole, just a few lone branches eerily piercing the surface.<br />\nEel Pie Island, near Twickenham, was carved as the river took a detour and forged a parallel path, slicing it from the mainland. Since the 17th Century, when according to a 1635 map there was a bowling alley on the island, it has been a haven for hedonists, music lovers and philanderers.<br />\nIts seclusion &ndash; it could only be reached by boat until the footbridge was erected in 1957 &ndash; made it a dream for extra-marital affairs. Local stories say that wealthy men would bribe the ferryman not to let their wives across so they could canoodle with their mistresses undisturbed.<br />\nThe island is named for the eel pies sold at its 19th-Century hotel; rarely spotted now, the slippery, snake-like fish were once abundant in this part of the Thames. The inn burned down in a mysterious 1971 fire, but the decades of entertainment, from ballroom dancing and beatnik jazz to early performances by the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart, are still spoken about in reverential tones.<br />\nTrevor Baylis frequented the hotel as a teenager, lured from his home in Kilburn in north-west London by &ldquo;pretty girls and jazz music&rdquo;. Smitten by the spit of land, the inventor built a home here in 1971.<br />\nThe community grew from &ldquo;just a few huts&rdquo; to around 50 homes with old hippies, young families and people &ldquo;with a special kind of spirit&rdquo;.<br />\n&ldquo;We were a family then, and we&rsquo;re a family now,&rdquo; Baylis said."},{"pid":"31a1c84f044362a089f38644ace499d5555db17a","tid":497937,"uid":5843,"like":6,"dislike":0,"score":6,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T10:15:50.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"color: red;\">紅咗啲字有咩用<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> </span>"},{"pid":"364debbb7642951c1fdeb0e07522da648834dea8","tid":497937,"uid":150618,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T10:16:18.000Z","msg":"on9仔 贏到先算啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"12406eabe9aa83e0f5275e7f884538686572f2e3","tid":497937,"uid":141421,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T10:16:47.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><span style=\"color: red;\">紅咗啲字有咩用<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> </span></blockquote><br />\n我都唔知啊"},{"pid":"31417355cfa79bec8bc85b1b99d3a2629b211e20","tid":497937,"uid":5843,"like":1,"dislike":2,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T10:18:04.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><blockquote><span style=\"color: red;\">紅咗啲字有咩用<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> </span></blockquote><br />\n我都唔知啊</blockquote><br />\n仲等我去查字典查左半個鐘=.="},{"pid":"c6e903cfea9687cc800be02cb0f543486b50be22","tid":497937,"uid":91152,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T10:18:12.000Z","msg":"樓豬iq=0"},{"pid":"12919317d196ed06da4d6f51026a7e7964506d22","tid":497937,"uid":141421,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T10:21:55.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>樓豬iq=0</blockquote><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/biggrin.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0ac5731354677d4967acb3cea88520ecb3170749","tid":497937,"uid":555,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T10:22:14.000Z","msg":"篇野又寫得幾抵死"},{"pid":"7e07c92733bfb096bdf2c278a30f207dd0b33b3c","tid":497937,"uid":141421,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T10:23:22.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>篇野又寫得幾抵死</blockquote><br />\n抽到獌狗應一應<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5abee611be61ea46866e3796aa0c3d32dceda6c2","tid":497937,"uid":156071,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T10:43:05.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><blockquote>篇野又寫得幾抵死</blockquote><br />\n抽到獌狗應一應<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n師兄識波<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b8a2952be5848f35354f89a955914cbdf482421f","tid":497937,"uid":67225,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T10:54:34.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8f2e926079d75fe108f74b11594742adb5ef1de6","tid":497937,"uid":81569,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T14:32:12.000Z","msg":"廢隊有咩資格講呢句"},{"pid":"a69d6f5624781ba679ec05579d6e59fc8f19e50a","tid":497937,"uid":141421,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T14:59:26.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>廢隊有咩資格講呢句</blockquote><br />\n雞湯都講得 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"93bfaf64c7d5f1dcd060ad75968a770c93cd9c3c","tid":497937,"uid":14374,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-13T15:06:02.000Z","msg":"又話獌狗好撚惡抽水都唔比 而家班反獌又唔入泥即係點<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/oh.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a728e959865d45a9dbadafc30863582815d85cc4","tid":497937,"uid":67225,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-18T04:54:22.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
