In some networks, we even found structures with up to 11 dimensions.&ldquo;<br />\n<br />\nJust to be clear - this isn&lsquo;t how you&rsquo;d think of spatial dimensions (our Universe has three spatial dimensions plus one time dimension), instead it refers to how the researchers have looked at the neuron cliques to determine how connected they are. <br />\n<br />\n&rdquo;Networks are often analysed in terms of groups of nodes that are all-to-all connected, known as cliques. The number of neurons in a clique determines its size, or more formally, its dimension,&ldquo; the researchers explained in the paper. <br />\n<br />\nHuman brains are estimated to have a staggering 86 billion neurons, with multiple connections from each cell webbing in every possible direction, forming the vast cellular network that somehow makes us capable of thought and consciousness."},{"pid":"f340a8e9df56f2ab94b2b11fd3827e6fa06833d2","tid":902916,"uid":126841,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-15T07:03:26.000Z","msg":"With such a huge number of connections to work with, it&lsquo;s no wonder we still don&rsquo;t have a thorough understanding of how the brain&lsquo;s neural network operates.<br />\n<br />\nBut the mathematical framework built by the team takes us one step closer to one day having a digital brain model.<br />\n<br />\nTo perform the mathematical tests, the team used a detailed model of the neocortex the Blue Brain Project team published back in 2015.<br />\n<br />\nThe neocortex is thought to be the most recently evolved part of our brains, and the one involved in some of our higher-order functions like cognition and sensory perception.<br />\n<br />\nAfter developing their mathematical framework and testing it on some virtual stimuli, the team also confirmed their results on real brain tissue in rats.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the researchers, algebraic topology provides mathematical tools for discerning details of the neural network both in a close-up view at the level of individual neurons, and a grander scale of the brain structure as a whole.<br />\n<br />\nBy connecting these two levels, the researchers could discern high-dimensional geometric structures in the brain, formed by collections of tightly connected neurons (cliques) and the empty spaces (cavities) between them.<br />\n<br />\n&rdquo;We found a remarkably high number and variety of high-dimensional directed cliques and cavities, which had not been seen before in neural networks, either biological or artificial,&ldquo; the team wrote in the study.<br />\n<br />\n&rdquo;Algebraic topology is like a telescope and microscope at the same time,&ldquo; said one of the team, mathematician Kathryn Hess from EPFL.<br />\n<br />\n&rdquo;It can zoom into networks to find hidden structures, the trees in the forest, and see the empty spaces, the clearings, all at the same time.&ldquo;"},{"pid":"0ecc67ec6b3dbcb9eb82ca328594ba2f404af956","tid":902916,"uid":126841,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-15T07:03:39.000Z","msg":"Those clearings or cavities seem to be critically important for brain function. When researchers gave their virtual brain tissue a stimulus, they saw that neurons were reacting to it in a highly organised manner.<br />\n<br />\n&rdquo;It is as if the brain reacts to a stimulus by building [and] then razing a tower of multi-dimensional blocks, starting with rods (1D), then planks (2D), then cubes (3D), and then more complex geometries with 4D, 5D, etc,&ldquo; said one of the team, mathematician Ran Levi from Aberdeen University in Scotland.<br />\n<br />\n&rdquo;The progression of activity through the brain resembles a multi-dimensional sandcastle that materialises out of

clear what makes the cliques and cavities form in their highly specific ways.<br />\n<br />\nAnd more work will be needed to determine how the complexity of these multi-dimensional geometric shapes
