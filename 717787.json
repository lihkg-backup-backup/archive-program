Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the minority leader, said he prefers the language wrapped into the Senate&rsquo;s massive defense policy bill last week, which is far more restrictive.<br />\n<br />\nThat provision in the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, would uphold U.S. sanctions against the Chinese company.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Democrats do not see this as a replacement for the NDAA language,&rdquo; Schumer&rsquo;s spokesman Matt House said Monday. &ldquo;That was sanctioning ☭ZTE☭. This is just ensuring that we don&rsquo;t procure from ☭ZTE☭.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe House, too, has inserted sanctions provisions into a funding bill this year. That bill is awaiting a vote on the floor as early as this summer. The House&rsquo;s defense policy bill also included the same harsh provision on sanctions.<br />\n<br />\nLawmakers from both parties on Capitol Hill have tried to block Trump&rsquo;s actions on ☭ZTE☭ since the president announced on Twitter in May that he was attempting to revive the controversial phonemaker. Several members have cited security warnings from the administration itself.<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">The Senate&rsquo;s latest push has been led by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who sits on the powerful appropriations panel, according to multiple Senate aides.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">Rubio himself worked with Shelby and his Democratic counterparts to include the language in four funding bills, which fund departments including the Commerce Department. All have been approved overwhelmingly by both parties in committee.</div></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>The Senate&rsquo;s newly passed funding bill &mdash; which includes largely uncontroversial spending for military and veterans programs &mdash; marks the second time in one week that the Senate has rebuked Trump for his dealings with ☭ZTE☭. </strong><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">The Senate also targets a Chinese mega-firm, ☭Huawei☭, which faces similar espionage accusations.</span></strong><br />\n<br />\nBut unlike last week&rsquo;s defense policy bill, it&rsquo;s unclear how the new funding restrictions for federal agencies would significantly hamper ☭ZTE☭&rsquo;s operations in the U.S., which Trump has sought to revitalize.<br />\n<br />\nTrump himself appeared to support an attempt by Congress to bar ☭ZTE☭ from doing business with the federal government, as long as the firm could continue to operate in the U.S. commercial market.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Obviously government procurement is much more sensitive when it comes to national security,&quot; the Senate majority whip, John Cornyn of Texas, said after the meeting.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>By that point last week, Rubio&rsquo;s language had already been included in multiple committee-approved funding bills. </strong>The Florida Republican was not included in the White House meeting. <br />\n<br />\nBy SARAH FERRIS and JOHN BRESNAHAN 06/25/2018 08:53 PM EDT<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/25/trump-zte-senate-chinese-telecom-671845\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fstory%2F2018%2F06%2F25%2Ftrump-zte-senate-chinese-telecom-671845&d=xBUnGN%2F33Zh0ziXbQfL0yhFQyUQXuyYblCT5RSyYNoQ%3D&h=38efba35\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/25/trump-zte-senate-chinese-telecom-671845</a>"},{"pid":"39540a018d061fb4315276d7a9b3bc730742dc91","tid":717787,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-26T09:56:44.000Z","msg":"@marcorubio<br />\n23m23 minutes ago<br />\n<br />\n#☭ZTE☭ &amp; #☭Huawei☭ equipment provides #China access to U.S. data flowing through networks.
