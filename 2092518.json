With respect, the irony in many of these comments seems to have been lost on the Secretary. For example, the statement that &ldquo;there is no room for discussion&rdquo; is completely at odds with the whole purpose of the Question, which is precisely to provoke or elicit a discussion and to test the candidates&rsquo; ability to deploy objective facts and argument in support of and/or against the particular proposition. The Secretary&rsquo;s apparent refusal or inability to brook even discussion of any contrary or even a more nuanced view or the balancing of views is, at best, disappointing.//<br />\n<br />\n甚至乎承認政府啲聲明係有威脅性（threating）<br />\n但係最尾都係判學生輸<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n// 70. The Secretary&rsquo;s comments also contain language consistent with a threat. Whilst on one hand supposedly recognising that question setting is an internal matter for the HKEAA, the Secretary nevertheless makes plain that the most effective solution to the perceived problem or controversy is to invalidate the Question. Whilst it is suggested that that solution is merely a &ldquo;request&rdquo;, that &ldquo;request&rdquo; is immediately reinforced by the statement that the problem with the question is obvious and that the EDB will decide what further action to take in the light of how the HKEAA responds to that &ldquo;request&rdquo;. The impression left is that there is also &ldquo;no room for discussion&rdquo; as to whether there was a problem, and if so what is the best way to deal with it. If that was not the intended impression, it was an unfortunate choice of words.//<br />\n<br />\n另外個官係咁讚條利弊題出得好啊<br />\n訓練考生批判性思考<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/touch.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n// 40. It might also be thought that the form of the Question seeks to promote an ability or skill now often sadly lacking in wider society. This lack is not just a Hong Kong phenomenon, though it has been rather evident in Hong Kong in recent times. In their rush to extremities of view, many people seem to have lost the ability (or perhaps the willingness) to see or even contemplate any middle ground, or to understand any nuance. All too often, people simply exist in their own &lsquo;echo chambers&rsquo;, which simply reinforce and only strengthen existing views. A preference for pithy slogans often simply masks the complexities of many issues. Trenchant shouting and stunts have replaced informed debate. Tolerance of the views of others, let alone a willingness to seek to understand and engage with them, or to seek more common ground, is on the wane. Civilised society is the poorer for it.//<br />\n<br />\n// 42. One might think the very purpose of the Question and the Sources provided with it is to test a candidate&rsquo;s ability to exercise his or her critical thinking functions, to weigh the apparent content of the Sources against the other facts known to the candidate, to balance those facts and to reach an overall reasoned conclusion. Depending on the facts deployed, the conclusion might be obvious, or it might be more finely- balanced. The factual period relevant to answering the Question is as long as 45 years, from the dawn of the 20 th century to the end of the Second World War. The events over that period, to which a student might make reference, were obviously legion and varied. Some facts might be so well-known as to be notorious.//<br />\n<br />\n// 44. That way, the Question will have served its obvious intended purpose. Indeed, it might be thought insulting to the better candidates for it to be suggested they might in some way be &ldquo;misled&rdquo; by the Question. It might also be thought overly paternalistic or patronising to the poorer candidates to think that they should not be marked down if they fail to exercise and demonstrate the very abilities and knowledge which the Question seeks to test.//"},{"pid":"b60ec24d75eefcbfe23f4b40d7e112b8b2b455d5","tid":2092518,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-03T10:13:41.000Z","msg":"判決全文￼：<a href=\"https://legalref.judiciary.hk/doc/judg/word/vetted/other/en/2020/HCAL001087_2020.doc\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Flegalref.judiciary.hk%2Fdoc%2Fjudg%2Fword%2Fvetted%2Fother%2Fen%2F2020%2FHCAL001087_2020.doc&d=nCDZGLdcAmB0c2Oxl6asXEZHjOsADYkIOf4eYSwfwZo%3D&h=1e30daf5\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://legalref.judiciary.hk/doc/judg/word/vetted/other/en/2020/HCAL001087_2020.doc</a>"},{"pid":"dbee62026ec7d98cfa1ef9e020dc272d8450b68c","tid":2092518,"uid":316927,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-03T10:25:23.000Z","msg":"狗官<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/knife.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d9ab2a68e76d20f8bd73a17fac27f795d7de7ca3","tid":2092518,"uid":254594,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-03T10:41:11.000Z","msg":"證據確鑿，無罪釋放<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yo.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
