Downey, a 42‐year‐old American held in China since 1952 on espionage charges, was freed today and crossed the border from China into Hong Kong at 11:50 A.M.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Downey, whom the United States has admitted was a member of the Central Intelligence Agency, appeared to be in good health, according to a Hong Kong government spokesman. He was smiling as he crossed the railway bridge over the Shumchun River, which marks the border between China and Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nThe spokesman said Mr. Downey was wearing a Chinesestyle blue shirt and trousers and a dark‐blue cap. He was carrying a big overcoat and a black traveling bag.<br />\n<br />\nAn American Red Cross official and two officials of the United States consulate general in Hong Kong were waiting to greet Mr. Downey on the British side of the border. They escorted him to a waiting heli copter, which took him to Hong Kong's airport.<br />\n<br />\nThere he boarded a plane bound for Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, where he was to change planes for a direct flight to the United States.<br />\n<br />\nThe White House announced last week that Mr. Downey was being released after President Nixon had sent word to Premier Chou En‐lai of China that Mr. Downey's mother was seriously ill. Mrs. Downey, who is 75, suffered a. stroke recently at her home in New Britain, Conn.<br />\n<br />\nThe Chinese have also agreed to release two American pilots, Maj. Philip E. Smith of the Air Force and Lt. Commander Robert J. Flynn of the Navy. The two fliers will be released on Thursday.<br />\n<br />\nStopover at Clark Air Base<br />\n<br />\nSpecial to The New York Times<br />\n<br />\nCLARK AIR BASE, the Philippines, Monday, March 12&mdash;John Downey arrived here this afternoon from Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Downey met his brother, William, here and they talked on the plane for 30 minutes. Then he debarked and walked about 40 yards to another waiting United States Air Force evacuation jet that will take him to Hartford, Conn. William Downey, who arrived only a few hours before his brother, said a doctor pronounced his brother's condition &ldquo;fair.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Downey\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJohn_T._Downey&d=1Tw5YvH57m5vrKXwbFhC6BT9vY2lxR77dvs0GIZdErU%3D&h=161d9d2f\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Downey</a><br />\n<br />\nNYT提到嘅另外兩位機師係<br />\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_E._Smith\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPhilip_E._Smith&d=1Tw5YvH57m5vrKXwbFhC6BT9vY2lxR77dvs0GIZdErU%3D&h=1d41a7d7\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_E._Smith</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Flynn\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRobert_J._Flynn&d=1Tw5YvH57m5vrKXwbFhC6BT9vY2lxR77dvs0GIZdErU%3D&h=e5b11c16\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Flynn</a><br />\n<br />\n具體呢條1973年香港政府製作嘅片係邊兩位飛機師，我估係後邊呢兩位，因為佢哋係同時釋放。"},{"pid":"2edfb26ed25c17be59279131d30fa7ef7e5e796a","tid":2144916,"uid":363147,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-07T19:42:20.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/us/robert-j-flynn-shot-down-in-vietnam-war-dies-at-76.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2014%2F05%2F25%2Fus%2Frobert-j-flynn-shot-down-in-vietnam-war-dies-at-76.html&d=1Tw5YvH57m5vrKXwbFhC6BT9vY2lxR77dvs0GIZdErU%3D&h=b4658a42\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/us/robert-j-flynn-shot-down-in-vietnam-war-dies-at-76.html</a><br />\n<blockquote>Robert J.

Flynn, who spent five and a half years in a Communist Chinese prison during the Vietnam War, almost always in solitary confinement, after he was shot down on a bombing mission, died on May 15 in Pensacola, Fla. Commander Flynn, one of only two American servicemen known to have been held by the Chinese during the war, was 76.<br />\n<br />\nThe cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Kathy.<br />\n<br />\nThen-Lieutenant Flynn, a bombardier-navigator, was taking part in a raid on Aug. 21, 1967, targeting rail yards near Hanoi, the North Vietnamese capital, about 75 miles from the Chinese border, when his two-man A-6 Intruder came under attack. The Pentagon later said his plane and another Intruder on that raid had been downed after straying over southern China while seeking to escape North Vietnamese jets.<br />\n<br />\nLieutenant Flynn and his pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Jimmy Lee Buckley, ejected from their craft. Lieutenant Flynn, suffering severe spinal injuries, found the pilot&rsquo;s body near the spot where he had come down, and he was soon captured.

It did not identify that airman, but Lieutenant Flynn was the only survivor from the two Intruders.<br />\n<br />\nMrs. Flynn said in an interview on Wednesday: &ldquo;I saw on TV he was being beaten, and the streets were lined with people. That&rsquo;s how I knew he was alive.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nFor the remainder of the Vietnam War, he spent virtually all his prison time in a small cell in Beijing, and he was kept in handcuffs for three separate periods, covering seven, 30 and 60 days, barely able to eat or perform bodily functions. After a time, he was allowed to correspond with his wife and received packages from her via the Red Cross.<br />\n<br />\nHe refused to provide military information to his captors or to take part in Chinese propaganda.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The most terrible part was the solitude, the solitude, the solitude,&rdquo; Commander Flynn told The Pensacola News Journal in 2008. &ldquo;What do you do with all that time? All those hours? All those days and years?&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;d think of my family,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d plan parties, birthdays, anniversaries for everyone. And I would imagine that Kathy bought some land in Alaska and gold was discovered there. And I had the biggest gold mine going. I had all kinds of people working for me &mdash; people I knew. And I ran a big imaginary corporation. That&rsquo;s what I did.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nFreedom finally came on March 15, 1973, when he was taken across a covered bridge into Hong Kong, wearing a blue Chinese cap. He was released to the American authorities there together with Maj. Philip E.
