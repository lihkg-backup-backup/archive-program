However, the average number new flats are 13,357, which was only 60% of the predicted demand. A severe shortage occurred and pushed up the property prices. The following policies failures are the reasons.<br />\n<br />\nLand Application List System imposed tight constraints on land supply. It is a &ldquo;developer-led&rdquo; auction; if a developer submission price of land meets 80% of the undisclosed price set by the government, a public auction was triggered. After 1997 Financial Crisis, Hong Kong property market was declining. To avoid over-supply, the government replaced the conventional Regular Land Auctions to the System during 2004-2010. The land became extremely scarce; limited land sold equals to limited housing units. Even with irregular land auction adopted after 2010, the housing supply could not be increased instantly as time lag of construction exists. <br />\n<br />\nRevoke of Home Ownership Scheme(HOS) exacerbated housing shortage. During 2002-2010, the government stopped construction of HOS. HOS supply decreased from a peak of 25,000 units in 2001 to 0 unit during 2011 to 2015. During the economic downturn, the public could afford the private units, but not in a booming market. More once HOS eligible buyers go to the private market and increased housing demands and prices. <br />\n<br />\nSlow progress on urban renewal helps little on the housing supply. In 2003, 390 units were demolished for redevelopment. In 2013, 1,800 residential units were expected to provide by Urban Renewal Authority, the major urban renewal developer. The situation seemed improved, but it was still less than 10% of the goal of 22,000. Worst of all, the existing rate of renewal cannot catch up the speed of urban decaying. In 2040, there will be 24,000 buildings aged 50 years or above and 900 buildings per annum should be redeveloped; the current rate of renewal is 250 buildings per annum."},{"pid":"39cf999765cb95140cb977725729c02e700b00fe","tid":641156,"uid":179571,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:26:36.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"4f903b02b1786b7b53be532497ce67d78fc8173f","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:29:14.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"6cbe62b4e93dc92f723628b5d4429afb2a33eef2","tid":641156,"uid":35393,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"4f903b02b1786b7b53be532497ce67d78fc8173f","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:29:14.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:30:22.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n咁呢篇文你點睇?"},{"pid":"256d4006d2f19b583763db472b5cbd47e13578c4","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:31:10.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"80bbe646cfc1c5faea4a2691a300d541a73ca4fe","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:36:22.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"314c3a9884376ff1a645b53a9abbbabead199ca4","tid":641156,"uid":179571,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:37:48.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"f576aed554f2137e72307330b5a3b838a0cfb0e0","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:38:30.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"aff7307b3af06ff06f1b8f6472e7310cc2598c88","tid":641156,"uid":35393,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"f576aed554f2137e72307330b5a3b838a0cfb0e0","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"314c3a9884376ff1a645b53a9abbbabead199ca4","tid":641156,"uid":179571,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"80bbe646cfc1c5faea4a2691a300d541a73ca4fe","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:36:22.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:37:48.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:38:30.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T20:40:22.000Z","msg":"不如你直接講邊份報紙啦<br />\n好奇睇睇"},{"pid":"92b8d9e7a84ddb963ba373fe57da945e00555d62","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T21:09:35.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"2f5608942a6c1b8cb203662220906715db5d34ba","tid":641156,"uid":107598,"like":1,"dislike":3,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T21:30:08.000Z","msg":"有啲似用中文brainstorm然後譯做英文寫出黎既文<br />\n你可以嘗試用英文黎brainstorm 咁樣會通順啲"},{"pid":"494a2c9aead2adf73674320d67aa272cf080a3ca","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":0,"dislike":4,"score":-4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T21:36:53.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"a614d53498ec842ff2d7322dd40c09c0f5cbe924","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T21:37:09.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"221fbea9a5a0070305f534adddde9b402755dede","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T21:37:30.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"7fdb6e1f95b0d45d7f47e320d18388ebae10b4e0","tid":641156,"uid":107598,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"494a2c9aead2adf73674320d67aa272cf080a3ca","tid":641156,"uid":44073,"like":0,"dislike":4,"score":-4,"quote":{"pid":"2f5608942a6c1b8cb203662220906715db5d34ba","tid":641156,"uid":107598,"like":1,"dislike":3,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T21:30:08.000Z","msg":"有啲似用中文brainstorm然後譯做英文寫出黎既文<br />\n你可以嘗試用英文黎brainstorm 咁樣會通順啲"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T21:36:53.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-04-24T21:42:22.000Z","msg":"簡單幫你改改 <br />\n<br />\nOriginal:<br />\n<br />\nWith a &lsquo;rise in housing&rsquo;
