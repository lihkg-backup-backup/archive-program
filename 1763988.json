everyone stopped having kids except one particular religious group...<br />\n<br />\nSomehow, I think the Sikh, and the Hindu, the Jews, and Protestants, the Buddhists, and all the Atheists, the Scientists and the Scientologists, and the Catholics, and the Capitalists, and the Pagans and Druids, and the even the Skinheads... well, there is power in diversity.  That's the point.<br />\n<br />\nI've come to realise that there are 2 basic camps:  There's the group that thinks that the majority opinion should rule no matter what and the other group that thinks individual rights and freedoms always win.   The former is deathly afraid of not being the dominant group, so they are opposed to immigration.  The latter wants and many different groups to come so that it's impossible for any one group to be dominant.  I'm pretty firmly in the latter.  <br />\n<br />\nThe more variety the better, better for me, because the less they agree on the less likely they'll be able to dominate anyone.<br />\n<br />\nThe Canadian constitution protects individual rights and freedoms.  It is very hard to change.  People keep trying, there is something called a &quot;notwithstanding&quot; clause.  Quebec is trying that again now... it probably won't survive the legal challenges.<br />\n<br />\nThis is actually something I worry about with your direct democracy system.  As it spreads around the world, and it will, it will end up being used in places that don't have strong legal protections for individuals.  Say... mainland China.  What prevents it from becoming &quot;the tyranny of the majority?&quot;  It would be better if the system baked in those individual rights, but I can't see how to do that yet."}]}
