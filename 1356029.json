We hope that you could spread our concerns to the world, in particular during press conferences.<br />\n<br />\nA few months ago, the Hong Kong government proposed to amend the extradition law so that criminal suspects could be sent to China for trial. This has caused grave concerns among many Hongkongers since China is notorious for suppressing human rights and using law as a tool for persecuting dissidents. Between June and July in particular, there were a number of mass protests against the extradition bill. However, not only did the government decline to withdraw the bill, it had allowed the police to use disproportionate force (violence) against peaceful protestors by recklessly throwing tear gas and firing bean bag rounds and rubber bullets at their heads.<br />\n<br />\nLast Sunday night, there were gangsters in white shirts flagrantly beating up citizens in the metro station (and some other places nearby). Prior to the tragedy, there had already been rumours on the internet that there would be gangsters beating protesters with cane sticks. Yet, despite repeated reports to the police, no response was made. The police stations nearby were even closed. The telephone line for police report was cut. Only almost an hour after the horror did the police arrive (and by then the gangsters had already fled). In fact, two police officers arrived at the scene shortly after the incident but chose to leave secretively. All of the above facts, which are already proved by video footage, have shown that the police deliberately turned a blind eye to crimes. The greatest evil is not the mobs - it&rsquo;s the collusion between them and the government.<br />\n<br />\nYou are a world-class football manager, but you are more than that: you speak for the suppressed Catalonians in spite of controversies. Thank you for utilising your position to voice for the suppressed. We sincerely hope that you could bring this message to the international stage, that Hong Kong needs democracy - without universal suffrage, Hongkongers could only be victims of the largest villain in the world, namely, dictatorship. Thank you for your time, we hope you and your team have enjoyed Hong Kong, a beautiful mixture of the east and west in the midst of its fading.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBest wishes,<br />\n<br />\nA bunch of Hongkongers who love football and democracy"},{"pid":"dca73097b49ace3ce7bf3c6e200d3191c641f44b","tid":1356029,"uid":153722,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-23T12:02:33.000Z","msg":"佢係你邊個姐<br />\n咁大段字搵鬼睇"},{"pid":"94be59d6bffb8fdee224e44b4ad45bae0aedf31a","tid":1356029,"uid":254923,"like":7,"dislike":1,"score":6,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-23T12:06:16.000Z","msg":"人地黎踢波姐 唔好搞鳩人啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n自己香港自己救<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"9994639f874feea0d5096aa90922a1c54901600e","tid":1356029,"uid":278253,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"dca73097b49ace3ce7bf3c6e200d3191c641f44b","tid":1356029,"uid":153722,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-23T12:02:33.000Z","msg":"佢係你邊個姐<br />\n咁大段字搵鬼睇"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-23T12:14:41.000Z","msg":"有冇建議點精簡？"},{"pid":"a14bf07c6ab2a7b084a27592a2c3f9e77d02850c","tid":1356029,"uid":65790,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-23T12:16:02.000Z","msg":"直接衝落球場之後再衝埋哥帥度<br />\n全世界直播...一定有NOISE"},{"pid":"3a1b5235c04719bd2b6c2a0f797e8ff0f64ebd25","tid":1356029,"uid":153722,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-23T12:17:42.000Z","msg":"拎橫額衝入球場個noise 仲大"},{"pid":"8fafdf0adec8a63d9b74650440c9405038f72e60","tid":1356029,"uid":21917,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-23T12:17:50.000Z","msg":"好似歐聯決賽咁 直接拎D野 衝出球場效果會大D"},{"pid":"86f78946617e4f0e097a8e36e3b6a95d44d29c02","tid":1356029,"uid":278253,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"94be59d6bffb8fdee224e44b4ad45bae0aedf31a","tid":1356029,"uid":254923,"like":7,"dislike":1,"score":6,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-23T12:06:16.000Z","msg":"人地黎踢波姐 唔好搞鳩人啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n自己香港自己救<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-23T12:28:02.000Z","msg":"既然佢今日都開到口講，希望再透過封信讓佢更了解現時既情況<br />\n如果各位巴絲打有更好既建議，請不吝提出，感激不盡"}]}
