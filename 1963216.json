Foxconn&rsquo;s collaboration with Medtronic covers design and development of the devices. Production will start within the next four to six weeks, Ishrak said, without quantifying a volume.<br />\n<br />\nFoxconn has been making face masks, used to curb the spread of the virus, in China since February and its subsidiary Sharp Corp. also began churning them out in Japan in late March.<br />\n<br />\nFoxconn&rsquo;s contract for its Wisconsin plant was signed with great fanfare in late 2017. President Donald Trump, who had helped bring the deal together with the state&rsquo;s then-governor, Republican Scott Walker, said Foxconn would revitalize U.S. manufacturing and that its massive factory hub would become &ldquo;the Eighth Wonder of the World.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nSince then, the plant-- which was originally intended for making display panels -- has been criticized for delays and changes of direction. The company missed its first-year hiring target by a wide margin, ending 2018 with 178 full-time employees."},{"pid":"55ae1c9e3d965a531d5a7124e9d2fc24d82cbded","tid":1963216,"uid":199957,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T03:59:13.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a14fdc33f8f919fbbd562f023fbbbf852d6d7b22","tid":1963216,"uid":3149,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T04:30:11.000Z","msg":"Push <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8a889d03739d382b8ca285be8a42cb2b872f4caf","tid":1963216,"uid":82394,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T04:48:22.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"35981200fcc89d930953bedfae287e8c5f527464","tid":1963216,"uid":44171,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T04:51:16.000Z","msg":"之前又講取消左開廠?"},{"pid":"0b87d74955e1045e010fcf5ccc27ea504b24d052","tid":1963216,"uid":290883,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T04:58:14.000Z","msg":"台美 聯盟，"},{"pid":"8ea2900e0b3a2f70ccf07d7eedf012b8c8a62c3a","tid":1963216,"uid":199771,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T06:03:01.000Z","msg":"與美國同一個鼻孔出氣"},{"pid":"42e703fa0d600b918760d816c3a7a5afcbbdaef8","tid":1963216,"uid":276525,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T06:04:12.000Z","msg":"郭台銘又係屎忽鬼"},{"pid":"c612ef81aa825bd27fca044c98b6e98b27be29ff","tid":1963216,"uid":157799,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T06:04:52.000Z","msg":"唔好意思，好怕大家忘記了，可唔可以入嚟幫手推一推<img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n［5個月］［整合］大家記唔記得今日係咩日子<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1963297\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1963297</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/iE9PUWa.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FiE9PUWa.png&h=0e7bfe30&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"fc1cbdb4d4e56e7b9e9a5a2cc9307fdb6e874f2e","tid":1963216,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T08:27:55.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"646502fef25079236494d267d5161112ee529ab3","tid":1963216,"uid":22736,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T08:31:13.000Z","msg":"美帝動員起來都幾恐怖"},{"pid":"6d90f0a47fecc59d4f0040183b358643247bdc7a","tid":1963216,"uid":120499,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T08:33:27.000Z","msg":"世界仔<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8a4409ab334dd78a3ecafed55db02877e5551197","tid":1963216,"uid":99962,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-08T08:34:28.000Z","msg":"侵真係勁"},{"pid":"3378c8acfe9d2ee861901b17f128947704aeb53d","tid":1963216,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-09T01:48:19.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/lihkg.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
