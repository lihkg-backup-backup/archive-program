For months now, the people of Taiwan have stood with Hong Kong, and this week the Taiwanese government expelled mainland tourists for damaging a Lennon Wall. <br />\n<br />\nIn response to Taiwan&rsquo;s support for Hong Kong, Apple this week succumbed to pressure from China and pulled the Taiwanese flag from the HK keyboard in the latest regional iOS update.<br />\n<br />\nLet&rsquo;s celebrate Taiwan&rsquo;s National Day, and send Apple a clear message, by waving the Taiwanese flag and buying from Taiwanese stores in Hong Kong. The fight for freedom in Hong Kong is a fight also for Taiwan&rsquo;s freedom. We are in this together. Taiwan&rsquo;s two days of public holidays (10/10 and 10/11) are an opportunity for us to show our gratitude and appreciation for Taiwan. ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼"},{"pid":"df9bf76ba56bf785abd52b6b4750221b88340fbf","tid":1641026,"uid":329723,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-09T08:38:43.000Z","msg":"Push!!
