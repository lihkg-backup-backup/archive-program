So when you hear people say that America hasn't-- it's not working very well or something of the sort, you know, in the whole world, of the six top companies in value, five of them are in the United States. And if you think about it-- you know, we talked a little about this last year. But in 1790, we had one half of 1% of the world's population-- a little less. We had 4 million people, 3.9 million people. 600,000 of them were slaves.<br />\n<br />\nIreland had more people than the United States had. Russia had five times as many people as the US did. Ukraine had twice as many people as the United States.<br />\n<br />\nSo here we were. But what did we have? We had a map for the future, an aspirational map, that somehow, now only 200-- well, after the Constitution, 232 years later, leaves us with five of the top six companies in the world.<br />\n<br />\nYou know, that's not an accident. And it's not because we were way smarter, way stronger, you know, anything of the sort. We had good soil and a decent climate, but so did some of those other countries I named. And the system has worked unbelievably well. Just imagine thinking of five of the top six companies in the world ending up with a country that started with a half of 1% of the population just a few hundred years ago.」<br />\n<br />\n今日巴郡年度股東大會巴菲特發言，唔知暗寸緊邊個<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/cow/cigar.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e5480ad03a1750ab65ea34eb8af61c80fdcd179b","tid":2512866,"uid":40267,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T05:33:05.000Z","msg":"另一間邊個<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\nAramco? 阿里 騰訊?"},{"pid":"14db46b18289fe51e34ed1fff4f3ea2a34371e68","tid":2512866,"uid":259777,"like":13,"dislike":1,"score":12,"quote":{"pid":"e5480ad03a1750ab65ea34eb8af61c80fdcd179b","tid":2512866,"uid":40267,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T05:33:05.000Z","msg":"另一間邊個<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\nAramco? 阿里 騰訊?"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T05:34:19.000Z","msg":"沙特阿美<br />\n巴老用市值計"},{"pid":"7e7e84da0d26811beb868d3991792771c9f64072","tid":2512866,"uid":321977,"like":9,"dislike":0,"score":9,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T05:47:23.000Z","msg":"支那話美國唔掂但中資又要去美國上市<img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/what.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"fa7c6210eedfaf8c8cfa06d92cd86689fb096cd5","tid":2512866,"uid":87737,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"7e7e84da0d26811beb868d3991792771c9f64072","tid":2512866,"uid":321977,"like":9,"dislike":0,"score":9,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T05:47:23.000Z","msg":"支那話美國唔掂但中資又要去美國上市<img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/what.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T05:51:14.000Z","msg":"香港上市嘅話，老闆走資唔方便<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/cut.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7b6868f5866a0692a19daef54896b5bb4141cd19","tid":2512866,"uid":257622,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T06:01:44.000Z","msg":"全世界得支那人話美國經濟唔掂，支那人用假新聞自我陶醉"},{"pid":"040ecf779f5fabab916b88394874fefeb6b3bf7f","tid":2512866,"uid":259777,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T12:11:38.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"05ea0b6d00b82372d23202cf0de81856c307d532","tid":2512866,"uid":235875,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T12:17:10.000Z","msg":"竟然無五毛入嚟<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1cc633e1d14e6db1757aa1aa2fe616245aa7208c","tid":2512866,"uid":393395,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T12:19:31.000Z","msg":"如果美國唔掂咁全世界都唔會掂<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"eeb7c675360bb8d5ff117b04302c1ee3e30dc012","tid":2512866,"uid":108201,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T12:20:53.000Z","msg":"死廢老仲唔係犯左國安法？三萬精兵幾時去捉佢番香港審？"},{"pid":"2c4e9fd69883488417c830e60103194055842695","tid":2512866,"uid":109098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T12:52:53.000Z","msg":"有少少離地<img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/pokemon_1.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n疫情殺得最多係中小企<br />\n旅遊產業全數負資產"},{"pid":"c9de1abf804a8ed7014c6fad58ce72a5e22297fd","tid":2512866,"uid":89225,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T13:17:19.000Z","msg":"美元。美國國債。起碼未來十年都唔會取代到"},{"pid":"c1f1c5c019d49f6785693f5ddffd09bec2961c62","tid":2512866,"uid":366470,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T13:29:14.000Z","msg":"全世界啲股市唔多唔少會受美股影響<br />\n美股仆街<br />\n冇人可以走得到<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"618e61a2b21284d1ab3d26ab2bbc472c052deb07","tid":2512866,"uid":64345,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T13:50:56.000Z","msg":"voo"},{"pid":"142e8c0938aa0533266d9405bc1eaba11174db3d","tid":2512866,"uid":352873,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"c9de1abf804a8ed7014c6fad58ce72a5e22297fd","tid":2512866,"uid":89225,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T13:17:19.000Z","msg":"美元。美國國債。起碼未來十年都唔會取代到"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-05-02T13:52:57.000Z","msg":"Crypto <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
