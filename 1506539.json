I saw them live at Saitama Super Arena which was marvelous. They've been strutting their stuff since they were children so don't sell them short. At the end of the last encore they bowed onstage soaking up the applause. They met with a standing ovation and thunderous applause. The band and the dancers and acrobats who were invited to perform gave a superb performance. The choreography, the stage design, the lighting design and the light sticks were unforgettable and beyond all expectations. On top of being an incredible musician the lead singer is also an avid runner. In years past he took part in a five hundred meter race where he came first. He rose to the challenge of passing the runners who were ahead of him earlier, ran for all he was worth and dived over the finish line. His family and loads of fans congratulated him on having won the race as he held up the trophy. The race was the opportunity for all the best male runners in Tokyo to strut their stuff. It was truly memorable. Yesterday I assigned five and a half hours for practicing their songs on my piccolo, flute, oboe, cor anglais (english horn) and clarinet. I practised with my friends who played triangle, tambourine, castanets, sleigh bells (jingle bells), cymbals, gongs, bass drum and snare drum, all of which have indefinite pitch. Adding these instruments makes the music more rhythmic. Saxophone, cor anglais andclatinet are transposing instruments. Saxophone, clarinet and bass clarinet are single reed instrument whereas oboe, cor anglais, bassoon and contrabassoon are double reed instruments. Flute is a reedless instrument. My friend Jay loves to play their songs on his cello and saxophone. I complimented him on his cello skills. Then he said &quot;yes what can I say?&quot; He was late because he got off at the wrong stop and had to wait for another bus. I asked &quot;how on earth did you miss your stop?&quot; He said &quot;I'm sorry. What can I say?&quot; The current situation is very bad.
