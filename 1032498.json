Falcon lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at the opening of a 32-minute window at 20:45 Eastern Time (01:45 UTC on Friday).<br />\n<br />\nThe primary payload for Thursday&rsquo;s launch was Nusantara Satu, a high-throughput communications satellite that will be operated by Indonesia&rsquo;s PT Pasifik Satelit Nusantara (PSN). However, much attention in the build up to launch has been paid to the Israeli Beresheet spacecraft that is piggy-backing on the Falcon 9 launch.<br />\n<br />\nBeresheet will attempt to become the first Israeli spacecraft, and the first privately-operated mission, to land on the Moon. The third satellite aboard Thursday&rsquo;s launch is S5, a space situational awareness demonstrator for the US Air Force Research Laboratory which will be deployed by Nusantara Satu at a later date.<br />\n<br />\nPreviously known as PSN VI or PSN-6, the Nusantara Satu satellite was built by Space Systems Loral around the SSL-1300 platform. Bound for a slot in geostationary orbit above the Earth&rsquo;s equator at 148 degrees East, Nusantara Satu carries 26 C-band and 12 extended C-band transponders and eight Ku-band transponders which will produce spot beams. The satellite offers a total bandwidth of 15 gigabits per second.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-10-231906.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasaspaceflight.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F10%2F2018-10-10-231906.jpg&h=ad5dbd09&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe 4,100 kilogram (9,040 lb) Nusantara Satu spacecraft is expected to operate for at least fifteen years. It will provide communications links to rural parts of Indonesia, allowing PSN to expand broadband internet services into these regions. Nusantara Satu is equipped with electric propulsion which will be used for orbit-raising maneuvers: Falcon 9 will drop the satellite off in an elliptical transfer orbit, with Nusantara Satu using its own engines to reach its final geostationary slot.<br />\n<br />\nOnce it has arrived in geostationary orbit, Nusantara Satu will deploy its subsatellite, S5. This is the US Air Force Research Laboratory&rsquo;s space situational awareness experiment &ndash; a 60 kilogram (130 lb) spacecraft that will detect and track objects in orbits close to the geostationary belt.<br />\n<br />\nS5 was constructed by Blue Canyon Technologies, with its instruments provided by Applied Defense Systems. The data it collects will help the Air Force to update its satellite catalog with accurate orbital parameters for these spacecraft and debris objects. S5 is intended as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that low-cost miniature satellites can be used for accurate tracking of geostationary satellites. It is expected to operate for one year.<br />\n<br />\nThe other payload aboard the Falcon 9 was Beresheet, a Lunar lander developed by Israel&rsquo;s SpaceIL. Taking its name from the first words of the Book of Genesis &ndash; in the beginning &ndash; in Hebrew, Beresheet will attempt a soft landing in the Moon&rsquo;s Mare Serenitatis region. If successful it will be not only Israel&rsquo;s first mission to the moon, but the first spacecraft to land on the Lunar surface that was not funded or operated by a government space agency."},{"pid":"3c0db0514e0a58f8cd690a48d82098bd4e19841b","tid":1032498,"uid":51720,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-22T12:41:28.000Z","msg":"以色列科技 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1dd9d3e03d53d3ac68575b1359d519bf05b163dc","tid":1032498,"uid":28624,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-22T13:20:32.000Z","msg":"以色列🇮🇱<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"cae6b8ad8fd8d3f4073b5b53e0f94372e83893f8","tid":1032498,"uid":40672,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-24T03:43:19.000Z","msg":"不如齊齊開個post講下CCtCap DM-1<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"59af559c74c63c3745f0d4e5d555dd7873d206f8","tid":1032498,"uid":40672,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-27T15:47:02.000Z","msg":"Short update<br />\n第二次orbit raising burn因爲電腦突然restart而自動取消咗<br />\n等待之後安排<br />\nNusantara Satu目前仍然進行緊GEO Insertion, 1.3 Deg Inclination"}]}
