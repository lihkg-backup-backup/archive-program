The writer-director said the film is a psychological horror movie set in London that stars a female character in the lead role. <span style=\"color: red;\">As inspirations for the film, Wright cited the horror classics Roman Polanski&rsquo;s &ldquo;Repulsion&rdquo; and Nicolas Roeg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Look Now.&rdquo;</span><br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told that the film will take place in two different time periods &mdash; the &rsquo;60s and modern day. Taylor-Joy will play the lead in the &rsquo;60s, while McKenzie will play a fashion student in modern day scenes, according to sources. I hear Smith will be playing Taylor-Joy&rsquo;s manager of sorts, though it&rsquo;s unclear whether that makes her an actress, a singer or something else entirely.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"555b984a3bc73ebc2f74da631c511ca37858bcd0","tid":1032857,"uid":4586,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-23T00:20:50.000Z","msg":"想睇simon pegg"},{"pid":"d4744d8fd87343772b816cebf41241423264576b","tid":1032857,"uid":159183,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-23T00:31:48.000Z","msg":"好期待<br />\n不過有排等<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"60a4067642f8af0ae1498cf6c7106657e4403a6d","tid":1032857,"uid":117117,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"quote":{"pid":"555b984a3bc73ebc2f74da631c511ca37858bcd0","tid":1032857,"uid":4586,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-23T00:20:50.000Z","msg":"想睇simon pegg"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-23T00:43:17.000Z","msg":"要加埋nick frost <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/tongue.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/ZRcOyaF.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FZRcOyaF.jpg&h=7d9e84ea&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"0b354e6fe375a4c8882f0e8299f5f4a66a7522c4","tid":1032857,"uid":4260,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"d4744d8fd87343772b816cebf41241423264576b","tid":1032857,"uid":159183,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-23T00:31:48.000Z","msg":"好期待<br />\n不過有排等<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-23T13:47:18.000Z","msg":"2020"}]}
