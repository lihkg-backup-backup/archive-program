The EU has also repeatedly spoken out on cases of intimidation and surveillance of journalists and media workers in China.<br />\n<br />\nAnother consequence of the Chinese authorities&rsquo; decision is that the Hong Kong public broadcaster has announced that it will cease relaying BBC World Service radio and BBC News Weekly, thereby further adding to the erosion of the rights and freedoms that is ongoing in the territory, following the imposition of the National Security Law in June 2020. This also illustrates the reduction of Hong Kong&rsquo;s autonomy within the &lsquo;One Country, Two Systems&rsquo; principle."},{"pid":"f3f307da6b6de81e9b6ffd8f955dcd79bc99f705","tid":2406696,"uid":38777,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-13T12:44:41.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c86bf37192a7f1d4d161ebbbbbdcd409f882554f","tid":2406696,"uid":290118,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-13T12:48:14.000Z","msg":"All talk, no action"}]}
