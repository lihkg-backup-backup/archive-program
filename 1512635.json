Over the past century we have been welcomed by the Chinese people and have been privileged to play a small part in Hong Kong's transformation from a bustling port to a dynamic metropolis on the world stage.<br />\n<br />\nMy late father often spoke about the uniqueness of Hong Kong. &quot;This area of the world,&quot; he once said, &quot;is going to develop as a neutral point of contact between two different ideologies and two different systems of government.&quot; This prediction made more than three decades ago is evident in the city's prosperity and growth, intrinsically linked to China's economic development.<br />\n<br />\nWith this deep connection, it is disheartening to see what has overtaken the city recently with the threat of a challenging situation escalating still further. I do not support violence nor do I believe that this should be the way to resolve conflicts. A commitment to the rule of law and maintaining peace and order is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's success. More importantly, our city's spirit that we have long valued is our ability to find solutions in mutual respect, understanding and open dialogue. We must not forget our unique place as that neutral point of contact and work tirelessly to restore the balance.<br />\n<br />\nI have spoken many times of how our young people are Hong Kong's future. We cannot leave them in desperation or despair. It is the responsibility of us all to rebuild trust in the community and create hope for the younger generation.<br />\n<br />\nBeing a part of Hong Kong has instilled the lion Rock Spirit in me and my children - that energy, ambition, drive and creativity has powered our prosperity and helped us to face many challenges. My faith in our home is undiminished. Now is a time for everybody to unite and be unswerving in our commitment not just to Hong Kong's special place, but to peaceful solution to our current crisis for this generation, the next, and beyond.<br />\n<br />\nThe Honourable Sir Michael Kadoorie<br />\n<br />\n支持猶太人"},{"pid":"d0541b31282f86940e332deca2d79d95727ba8e9","tid":1512635,"uid":89145,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-28T03:18:02.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"3c718436771f730fb6d8d73638c38ceabc567445","tid":1512635,"uid":284522,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-28T03:18:08.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/PWzcvgg.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FPWzcvgg.jpg&h=187c67d0&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n九月一號下午一點機場見<br />\n<br />\n901機場和你塞 Channel<br />\n<a href=\"http://t.me/stuckwithyou\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fstuckwithyou&d=zAhFImnUcMh%2FonyB55KWQ1LtzFpi4hzjoOYPfLz2gO4%3D&h=af03602b\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">t.me/stuckwithyou</a><br />\n901機場和你塞 公海<br />\n<a href=\"http://t.me/stuckwithyouopen\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fstuckwithyouopen&d=zAhFImnUcMh%2FonyB55KWQ1LtzFpi4hzjoOYPfLz2gO4%3D&h=c6033587\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">t.me/stuckwithyouopen</a><br />\n901機場和你塞 宣傳<br />\n<a href=\"http://t.me/stuckwithyoupromote\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fstuckwithyoupromote&d=zAhFImnUcMh%2FonyB55KWQ1LtzFpi4hzjoOYPfLz2gO4%3D&h=3103d842\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">t.me/stuckwithyoupromote</a>"},{"pid":"59e16c68cc89eeeadebeba6ec46a47b6eec6231a","tid":1512635,"uid":38494,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-28T03:19:59.000Z","msg":"8.28 停止國泰白色恐怖 愛丁堡廣場<br />\n8.28 #Metoo 遮打花園<br />\n8.31 民陣遊行 直指中聯辦<br />\n9.01 機場 13:00<br />\n9.02 全港三罷<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">今晚見</span></strong></span><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/dance2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/dance2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/dance2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0bfb867e3af2867b99f1d150a97a3bd990c75705","tid":1512635,"uid":260740,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-28T18:35:16.000Z","msg":"Push"}]}
