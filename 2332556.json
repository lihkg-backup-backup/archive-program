But a new study from the London School of Economics says 50 years of such tax cuts have only helped one group &mdash; the rich.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe new paper, by David Hope of the London School of Economics and Julian Limberg of King's College London, examines 18 developed countries &mdash; from Australia to the United States &mdash; over a 50-year period from 1965 to 2015. The study compared countries that passed tax cuts in a specific year, such as the U.S. in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes on the wealthy, with those that didn't, and then examined their economic outcomes. <br />\n<br />\nPer capita gross domestic product and unemployment rates were nearly identical after five years in countries that slashed taxes on the rich and in those that didn't, the study found. <br />\n<br />\nBut the analysis discovered one major change: The incomes of the rich grew much faster in countries where tax rates were lowered. Instead of trickling down to the middle class, tax cuts for the rich may not accomplish much more than help the rich keep more of their riches and exacerbate income inequality, the research indicates.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Based on our research, we would argue that the economic rationale for keeping taxes on the rich low is weak,&quot; Julian Limberg, a co-author of the study and a lecturer in public policy at King's College London, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. &quot;In fact, if we look back into history, the period with the highest taxes on the rich &mdash; the postwar period &mdash; was also a period with high economic growth and low unemployment.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nBecause the analysis ends in 2015, the research doesn't include President Donald Trump's massive tax overhaul, which he signed into law in late 2017 and which slashed taxes for the rich and corporations while providing a moderate cut for the middle class. But Limberg, who co-authored the study with David Hope, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics' International Inequalities Institute, said that he wouldn't expect the results of that tax cut to be much different.<br />\n<br />\nAlready, Mr. Trump's tax cuts have lifted the fortunes of the ultra-rich, according to 2019 research from two prominent economists, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley. For the first time in a century, the 400 richest American families paid lower taxes in 2018 than people in the middle class, the economists found. <br />\n<br />\n The &quot;careful&quot; new research from the London School Economics &quot;suggests indeed that tax increases on the wealthy should be considered post-COVID,&quot; Berkeley's Zucman said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.<br />\n<br />\nEngine for stronger economic growth?<br />\nTo be sure, the economy was humming along before the pandemic struck the nation in March, with an unemployment rate that was at its lowest in about half a century. Conservative think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute pointed to Mr. Trump's tax cuts as an engine for stronger economic growth.<br />\n<br />\nYet even so, millions of American families struggled to find jobs that paid living wages, while the cost of essentials such as health care, housing and education increased at far faster rates than the typical income. Even before the pandemic, income inequality had reached its highest point in 50 years, according to Census data.<br />\n<br />\n......"},{"pid":"8f251f8a2f7bc2c78cd2046192bfdfc507b1fcf9","tid":2332556,"uid":41988,"like":18,"dislike":0,"score":18,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-19T17:03:56.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/KsuUkQR.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FKsuUkQR.png&h=cfb1b91b&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n5毛 block"},{"pid":"4c6c45f2ee35000bb2885cb235282d66c915ac57","tid":2332556,"uid":276028,"like":0,"dislike":13,"score":-13,"quote":{"pid":"8f251f8a2f7bc2c78cd2046192bfdfc507b1fcf9","tid":2332556,"uid":41988,"like":18,"dislike":0,"score":18,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-19T17:03:56.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/KsuUkQR.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FKsuUkQR.png&h=cfb1b91b&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n5毛 block"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-19T17:28:33.000Z","msg":"收皮啦垃圾！"},{"pid":"8863790a9916c35ab4956ff0c8b8256b9449c9b1","tid":2332556,"uid":276028,"like":0,"dislike":4,"score":-4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-20T04:14:02.000Z","msg":"自推。"},{"pid":"e3941e22531a03a7905ac1d5c8da1174f7cb7a7c","tid":2332556,"uid":276028,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-20T09:13:33.000Z","msg":"自推。"},{"pid":"7d7a943875ff643fa90747054ad14acddb28e52d","tid":2332556,"uid":360344,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-20T09:26:27.000Z","msg":"五毛點解唔用微信朋友圈<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"cdadc899134215b3b32a9cbaa1ad61a1956434af","tid":2332556,"uid":276028,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-20T09:35:53.000Z","msg":"自推。"},{"pid":"71b0bdbbc73cc093bea7124380d6dbc4d351a6fc","tid":2332556,"uid":133127,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-20T09:55:49.000Z","msg":"推都冇撚用啦 比拜登盜國 比人出check 都7000萬票 <br />\n<br />\n林鄭1200人選出黎既垃圾點比啊 <br />\n<br />\n肥上瘦下 點肥都肥啊過港共 <br />\n<br />\n侵任內最低失業率"},{"pid":"d7939ef2e37fafddab4502d94e722123950197fb","tid":2332556,"uid":276028,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-20T12:55:24.000Z","msg":"自推。"},{"pid":"02fe64b35b0d32f7c866b13fd25e7ca704aa9ad2","tid":2332556,"uid":90660,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-20T12:59:16.000Z","msg":"你搵隻垃圾嚟同我侵俾?"},{"pid":"193a1406aae45c416cac202b666e5e7eca1516b7","tid":2332556,"uid":276028,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-20T15:48:42.000Z","msg":"自推"},{"pid":"f0368f727e8d6e1c67991e56cbf7bb7e09043b3a","tid":2332556,"uid":298796,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-21T03:20:24.000Z","msg":"見左膠POST, 即屌加BLOCK"},{"pid":"9bc4d8d1e6043e16005dced1aea702ddedab2042","tid":2332556,"uid":33498,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-21T03:21:50.000Z","msg":"拉"},{"pid":"1bd84ef675aeca6e85a4e98ba74301e6f5aa7d5b","tid":2332556,"uid":276028,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-21T06:20:02.000Z","msg":"自推。"},{"pid":"ed89471aedb5048335c3b301a0ab6b93babf1989","tid":2332556,"uid":198467,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-21T06:27:23.000Z","msg":"Blocked"},{"pid":"90e16c33cf356466fc9751134cf234ceeb067004","tid":2332556,"uid":276028,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-25T08:43:49.000Z","msg":"自推。"},{"pid":"782f26c3ddce29ee034522b1bfed9fb23bb8aee8","tid":2332556,"uid":78304,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-28T04:02:58.000Z","msg":"完全封鎖<br />\n敗燈死全家果日先解封"},{"pid":"15c6d9407413a10847b666317e0ab145365e5de9","tid":2332556,"uid":276028,"like":0,"dislike":5,"score":-5,"quote":{"pid":"782f26c3ddce29ee034522b1bfed9fb23bb8aee8","tid":2332556,"uid":78304,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-28T04:02:58.000Z","msg":"完全封鎖<br />\n敗燈死全家果日先解封"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-28T10:55:33.000Z","msg":"講事實都要被人罵，收皮啦！"}]}
