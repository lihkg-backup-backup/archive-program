At around 1900 on 2/11/2019, F328 was attacked by the riot police as seen in a video, the fireman reacted promptly and inspected the damage of the vehicle, meanwhile he questioned the police firmly yet clearly, which I consider as professional and appropriate since the behaviour of police recently became unpredictable and unreasonable. This fireman was courageous enough to confront them, risking being assaulted, in order to protect the property of FSD which was essential in carrying out rescue operations to safeguard the people in HK. <br />\nThere is rumour about this fireman being punished by the department. I hope this is not true because he has done no wrong, instead, he took up the responsibility spontaneously without hesitation which should be appreciated.<br />\nThank you for your attention.<br />\n<br />\nRegards,<br />\n<br />\nXxxxxxx<br />\nA HK citizen"}]}
