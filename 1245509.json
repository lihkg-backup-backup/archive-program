In Europe, the word first came into wide usage in the 19th century by various political theorists and statesmen in France, Germany and Italy, united in their horror at the bloodshed of the French Revolution, but otherwise varied in their positive views.<br />\n<br />\nModern democracy also has no necessary connection to liberalism. The Protestant champions of popular sovereignty in the 16th century summoned it for the express purpose of dethroning rulers with whose religious views they disagreed: &ldquo;It was not religious liberty they sought, but the elimination of wrong religions,&rdquo; as the historian Edmund Morgan wrote in 1988.<br />\n..................................<br />\n<br />\nIn other words, modern democracy was not the rule of a sovereign people &ndash; instead, &ldquo;democracy is the rule of the politician&rdquo;, someone skilled at commanding public opinion and winning elections, whose power is chiefly balanced by his need for reelection, and the requirement that he leave office peacefully, should he lose the vote.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/oct/11/could-populism-actually-be-good-for-democracy\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2Foct%2F11%2Fcould-populism-actually-be-good-for-democracy&d=cvYurzZEI7gK%2Fp8SijS8D54O1D3QR3Td9ugMDSJ%2BOB4%3D&h=6bfe6276\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/oct/11/could-populism-actually-be-good-for-democracy</a>"},{"pid":"70f87fef71631010ccddae4d369f9e8309944424","tid":1245509,"uid":251026,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-20T10:38:28.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stratfor/2017/05/25/the-forces-driving-democratic-recession/#2cc766ec4db2\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fstratfor%2F2017%2F05%2F25%2Fthe-forces-driving-democratic-recession%2F%232cc766ec4db2&d=cvYurzZEI7gK%2Fp8SijS8D54O1D3QR3Td9ugMDSJ%2BOB4%3D&h=09dfc367\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/stratfor/2017/05/25/the-forces-driving-democratic-recession/#2cc766ec4db2</a><br />\nFounding co-editor of the Journal of Democracy Larry Diamond wrote a 2015 paper, &quot;Facing up to the Democratic Recession.&quot; Diamond asks, reasonably enough, &quot;Why have freedom and democracy been regressing in many countries? The most important and pervasive answer is, in brief, bad governance.&quot; But this tells us very little. How and why has governance been so bad?<br />\n<br />\nDiamond's Stanford colleague, Francis Fukuyama was once so confident that democracy had definitively defeated its two main rivals, fascism and communism, that he famously stuck his neck out claiming &quot;the end of history.&quot; This year, 2017, Fukuyama stated in an interview with Edward Luce, author of the just published book, The Retreat of Western Liberalism, &quot;Everything I've been working on for the past year suddenly feels trivial. The only topic I can think about is the future of liberal democracy.&quot; Fukuyama fears that the global democratic recession may turn into a global democratic depression.<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/wfc2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b3c168830f84ffa14e0784360dcf18c2b0befa66","tid":1245509,"uid":212624,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-30T05:32:19.000Z","msg":"點睇新自由主義同古典自由主義"}]}
