It also needs to explain how the strategy will be affected by a continuation of social unrest, as well as counter negative perceptions internationally.<br />\n<br />\nA report in September said six out of eight global PR companies had declined the government&rsquo;s request in August for a worldwide outreach campaign, amid the heightening political tensions caused by anti-government protests. （一份報道於九月稱，由反政府示威引發的緊張政治局面期間，八間國際公關公司當中，六間婉拒政府的全球招標工作中的邀請。）<br />\n<br />\nLam later confirmed several companies had been approached, but the government had been advised that &ldquo;the time was not right&rdquo; to rebuild the city&rsquo;s image.<br />\nIn the tender document the government admitted months of social unrest last year, followed by a global health crisis of enormous magnitude this year, had a severe impact on Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Throughout the social unrest in 2019 there were views that the Hong Kong government did not effectively present its case to defend its actions, or effectively mobilise the community to support law enforcement actions and condemn intimidation, doxxing, vandalism and the criminal and violent behaviour of rioters,&rdquo; the government said.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;This had a negative impact on global perceptions about Hong Kong. Addressing these perceptions to effectively tell the Hong Kong story to targeted global audiences will be critical to support Hong Kong&rsquo;s economic recovery.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"b5be7b655c9f23a68ab503ae1aaf5665f7b15286","tid":1995716,"uid":27530,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-30T12:40:22.000Z","msg":"The document said local sentiment about the government remained negative despite Hong Kong faring &ldquo;quite well&rdquo; in the fight against Covid-19.<br />\n&ldquo;Social unrest may return and ongoing geopolitical tensions may continue to impact international opinion and sentiment about Hong Kong,&rdquo; it noted.<br />\n<br />\nThe government has already earmarked close to HK$300 billion (US$38.7 billion) in relief measures via an anti-epidemic fund and budget measures to help the city during the crisis, including offering wage subsidies capped at HK$9,000 for each worker to employers to save jobs.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;As one of the world&rsquo;s most open and interconnected economies, Hong Kong must lay the groundwork to reconnect with global audiences and reopen for business and visitors,&rdquo; the government said.<br />\n&ldquo;It [the successful bidder] must ensure that overseas businesspeople, investors, traders and professionals are aware of Hong Kong&rsquo;s economic recovery and continued strengths and advantages as a global financial, trade and services hub in the Asian time zone.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nPublic affairs consultant Andy Ho On-tat, an adviser to then Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang Yam-kuen from 2006 to 2012, said even if Lam found someone to lead the campaign, it would eventually backfire with her failure to address the crisis of confidence in the city arising from the social unrest.<br />\n<br />\nHe pointed to the government&rsquo;s refusal to set up an independent committee to investigate the social unrest as a typical example of its inaction.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;It will be a waste of money,&rdquo; Ho warned. To rebuild Hong Kong&rsquo;s image, the first thing is to restore Hongkongers&rsquo; confidence in the city&rsquo;s governance and its future.&rdquo;（何提醒，這只會浪費金錢。要重建香港國際形象，第一步需要先恢復香港人對政府的信心）<br />\n<br />\nHe said the core issues concerned how Lam had addressed mounting public frustrations over the perceived erosion of the rule of law, alleged police brutality and integrity issues among officials.<br />\n&ldquo;But so far the government has given the public an impression that it is unwilling to address these issues and has taken a high-handed approach to crack down on its opponents.&rdquo; he said.何稱，問題的核心在於政府如何應對市民的各種無力感，包括法治的失效、警隊的暴力及官員的操守問題，但至今市民只感到政府並無意處理及只用高壓手段打壓異見人士。）<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;How can the government restore global communities&rsquo; confidence in Hong Kong? How can it convince them to invest in Hong Kong when Hongkongers themselves don&rsquo;t have faith in the city?&rdquo;"},{"pid":"c0022ca727976e79a17c5bdda4c21ae4fa2021b6","tid":1995716,"uid":249794,"like":8,"dislike":1,"score":7,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-04-30T12:42:53.000Z","msg":"屌真係柒撚到仆街 <br
