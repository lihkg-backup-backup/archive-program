src=\"/assets/faces/pig/sowhat.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n我們什麼時候賣？ GME陸軍快速指南。 （秘密戴上鑽石手💎🙌）<br />\nDD<br />\n關於何時出售的錯誤信息太多。我厭倦了看到人們將GME下跌20％時將其交到紙上，或者說要在周五賣出（順便說一句，不要他媽的賣星期五，否則我會過來給你做東西！），所以這是權威的指南發揮結局。<br />\n<br />\n首先，我們需要了解什麼是&ldquo;可涵蓋天數&rdquo;或&ldquo;空頭比率&rdquo;。<br />\n<br />\n官方定義：<br />\n<br />\n補貨天數（也稱為空頭比率）用於衡量平倉公司已賣空的已發行股票的預期天數。<br />\n<br />\n補貨天數是通過將當前做空的股票數量除以該公司的平均每日交易量得出的。<br />\n<br />\n高的&ldquo;覆蓋天數&rdquo;比率通常表示潛在的短期緊縮。<br />\n<br />\n啞版：<br />\n<br />\n-假設您是Melvin Capital，並且有100萬個假陽具。將所有這些假陽具從您的屁股中拉出來需要多長時間？如果每天去除假陽具的數量為1，那麼將需要100萬天才能去除100萬個假陽具。如果一天是50,000假陽具，那就是20天。<br />\n<br />\n-涵蓋空頭頭寸也是一樣。 Melvin Capital和其他空頭要多久才能補倉？您將所有賣空的股票除以每天的平均股票交易量，得出的結果稱為&ldquo;可涵蓋天數&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n現在您知道要涵蓋的日期是什麼，您可以查看許多網站以了解GME的涵蓋日期.https：//<a href=\"http://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/=\"

/>\n<br />\n好吧，我們只是在等待Melvin Capital開始擔任其職位的那一天。那一天幾點很快就該死。他們正在為自己的頭寸支付瘋狂的利率，這使他們大失所望，星期五很多看跌期權到期，加上許多ITM（以金錢計）在星期五到期，可以行使獲得股份。<br />\n<br />\n週五可能是梅爾文資本（Melvin Capital）沒有選擇但無法開始報導的日子。<br />\n<br />\n現在，如果發生這種情況，那麼梅爾文資本（Melvin Capital）不需要花1個小時來掩蓋所有短褲，而是DAYS。這意味著如果梅爾文資本開始涵蓋星期五，它將需要至少5天的時間才能完全覆蓋，這意味著下週的全部價格將不斷上漲！因此，實際上，我要說的是，如果下週五開始補倉，那麼下週的周三或週四可能是最高賣出時間。無需恐慌出售。無需擔心持續數分鐘的頂部。它將持續數天！！！！<br />\n<br />\n現在，CNBC和所有MM以及腐敗的媒體都會騙你，以為Melvin Capital已經掩蓋了他們的空頭或其他胡說，但不要相信。這樣做需要幾天的時間！<br />\n<br />\n您應該查看的唯一數字是空頭比率。如果變得越來越小，那麼擠壓就開始了。如果它仍然像現在一樣以138％至140％的速度運轉，則還沒有發生。<br />\n<br />\n下班後我們要花250美元，短褲還沒開始賣！想像一下他們什麼時候做的？ $ 1000實際上是一個非常低的估計，不再是一個模因數。如果我們都正確地演奏並在短褲遮蓋的同時保持住，那麼我們可以從字面上將其壓縮到無窮大，因為它們試圖遮蓋。<br />\n<br />\nTL：DR

A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )<br />\nDD<br />\nToo much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, we need to understand what is &quot;Days to Cover&quot; or &quot;Short Ratio&quot; .<br />\n<br />\nOfficial definition:<br />\n<br />\nDays to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.<br />\n<br />\nDays to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.<br />\n<br />\nA high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.<br />\n<br />\nDumbed down version:<br />\n<br />\n- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.<br />\n<br />\n- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called &quot;Days to Cover&quot;<br />\n<br />\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.https://<a href=\"http://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketbeat.com%2Fstocks%2FNYSE%2FGME%2Fshort-interest%2F&d=LvSu6Mc%2FVB7R449T953cUxq8xf71D2STVxQEH8iwqLk%3D&h=336cc0af\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/</a> = 6 days<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fshortsqueeze.com%2F%2Fshortinterest%2Fstock%2Fterm2.php%3Fs%3DGME&d=LvSu6Mc%2FVB7R449T953cUxq8xf71D2STVxQEH8iwqLk%3D&h=59c263be\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME</a> = 6.3 days<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fquote%2FGME%2Fkey-statistics%3Fp%3DGME&d=LvSu6Mc%2FVB7R449T953cUxq8xf71D2STVxQEH8iwqLk%3D&h=7f552dbb\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME</a> = 5.78 days<br />\n<br />\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.<br />\n<br />\nSo what does that mean for us?<br />\n<br />\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.<br />\n<br />\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.<br />\n<br />\nNow, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!<br />\n<br />\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it.

How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.<br />\n<br />\n- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called &quot;Days to Cover&quot;<br />\n<br />\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.https://<a href=\"http://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketbeat.com%2Fstocks%2FNYSE%2FGME%2Fshort-interest%2F&d=LvSu6Mc%2FVB7R449T953cUxq8xf71D2STVxQEH8iwqLk%3D&h=336cc0af\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/</a> = 6 days<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fshortsqueeze.com%2F%2Fshortinterest%2Fstock%2Fterm2.php%3Fs%3DGME&d=LvSu6Mc%2FVB7R449T953cUxq8xf71D2STVxQEH8iwqLk%3D&h=59c263be\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME</a> = 6.3 days<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fquote%2FGME%2Fkey-statistics%3Fp%3DGME&d=LvSu6Mc%2FVB7R449T953cUxq8xf71D2STVxQEH8iwqLk%3D&h=7f552dbb\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME</a> = 5.78 days<br />\n<br />\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.<br />\n<br />\nSo what does that mean for us?<br />\n<br />\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON.

So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes.

A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )<br />\nDD<br />\nToo much disinformation about when to sell.

How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass.
