On the way there, we went by the blue bridge and saw some suspicious looking, triad like members, ripping off the post-it notes from the wall. I then tried to take a video of them but they immediately turned at me and said stop filming in a very aggressive manner (video 1). I just continued walking, spoke English with my friend and pretended like I didn't know any canto so he left. <br />\n<br />\nAfter we got Ramen, as I was going home, I saw a large amount of cops at the bridge and probably someone got beaten up (video 2). Please, lets show our support to those who suffered tn at the bridge and those who stood up to the gangsters. <br />\n<br />\nThe whole thing escalated within no more than 20 minutes I would say. These gangsters are no joke. <br />\n<br />\nLet's go Hong Kong, never give up!<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/ZWcuQgE\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2Fa%2FZWcuQgE&d=ajJRCbjZ3CJF8zdY8%2Fu%2F1ylZyh30VB0jKt3ffwT98zY%3D&h=d360ed45\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/a/ZWcuQgE</a>"}]}
