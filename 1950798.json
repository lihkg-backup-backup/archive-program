The former secretary of State linked to The New York Times&rsquo;s Thursday coverage of the U.S. officially leading the world in confirmed coronavirus cases. <br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/rqzbJsM.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FrqzbJsM.png&h=70ab9706&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nThis was not the first time Clinton criticized Trump over his administration&rsquo;s handling of the pandemic. She also tweeted Friday:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/muEyWNP.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FmuEyWNP.png&h=81ce96d7&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nAt a February meeting at the White House with African American leaders, Trump said &ldquo;And you know what? If we were doing a bad job, we should also be criticized. But we have done an incredible job. We&rsquo;re going to continue. It&rsquo;s going to disappear. One day &mdash; it&rsquo;s like a miracle &mdash; it will disappear.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nOn Thursday, Trump questioned during an interview with Fox New&rsquo;s Sean Hannity whether New York will actually need the tens of thousands of ventilators the state&rsquo;s leaders have said it requires. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;I don&rsquo;t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you go into major hospitals, sometimes they&rsquo;ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they're saying, 'Can we order 30,000 ventilators?' &quot; Trump said.<br />\n<br />\nEarlier this week, Clinton also called out Trump, tweeting, &ldquo;Please do not take medical advice from a man who looked directly at a solar eclipse.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nThe jab references Trump temporarily taking off his protective glasses and looking at the sky during an August 2017 eclipse.<br />\n<br />\nThere are more than 97,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. as of Friday afternoon. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/489905-hillary-clinton-on-us-leading-coronavirus-cases-trump-did\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fblogs%2Fblog-briefing-room%2Fnews%2F489905-hillary-clinton-on-us-leading-coronavirus-cases-trump-did&d=HeGJypC3zV9uypmZg8TJ2cQ0GhOv7yEvjYTsEPvBCF8%3D&h=a7639052\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/489905-hillary-clinton-on-us-leading-coronavirus-cases-trump-did</a>"},{"pid":"d5e125fe7eda65fa224be57e87eeb223db6b8d3a","tid":1950798,"uid":237459,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T14:33:32.000Z","msg":"收嗲啦Killary無人識你呀人起朵你起朵"},{"pid":"20788505fd8a0e3bdd71c24055715867ef6a4173","tid":1950798,"uid":128514,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T15:01:48.000Z","msg":"俾你條八婆做咪學晒加拿大咁囉"},{"pid":"ba37a9d017e6ec617fb04ad4ca75bc6d1e7bf5f7","tid":1950798,"uid":104138,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T15:04:11.000Z","msg":"佢條tweet 被人屌到飛起"},{"pid":"007ea8f8d242f753ed142d43acb04aabf55b9636","tid":1950798,"uid":292544,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T15:05:16.000Z","msg":"唔好亂幫共和黨打民主黨...歸錯邊就做蔣介石2.0"},{"pid":"e44fa33fae03b08700a3f201e41abe062deefe88","tid":1950798,"uid":235801,"like":9,"dislike":0,"score":9,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T15:05:20.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/KvXD8bp.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FKvXD8bp.jpg&h=b829677c&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"de44eaeaf352323f068f9f87b0c7875e5c296e28","tid":1950798,"uid":339272,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T15:14:14.000Z","msg":"Trump 加 美國 的確第一"},{"pid":"df0a03c2cc5b438505174429f6c1c093ceb23d23","tid":1950798,"uid":266654,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T15:14:20.000Z","msg":"睇下好啦<br />\n唔好介入黨爭<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/sowhat.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n好唔尊重咖"},{"pid":"8b5007e395ffebd672d5a58e11709c54aa9b6461","tid":1950798,"uid":227813,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-31T03:28:33.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">82547</span></strong></span> vs  <span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">161872</span></strong></span>"}]}
