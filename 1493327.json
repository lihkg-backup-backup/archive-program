By Chapman Chen<br />\n<br />\nThe Star-Spangled Banner was written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key and officially adopted as the national anthem of the United States of America in 1931. It summarizes the moral courage of the founding fathers of America picking up their arms to chase away the most powerful colonizer in the world at that time and build up a great independent country. It is often seen in Hong Kong protests of China Fascism. There are quite a few Chinese translations of the song, but they are either too wordy or inaccurate or grammatically incorrect or not elegant enough. I therefore set out to re-translate it.<br />\n<br />\nA Concise and Refined Style <br />\n<br />\nThe new translation's style is concise and refined. It involves short sentences of four or six characters, a feature of the Book of Songs (11th to 7th centuries BC) and the Sung poetry (960-1279). The language used is a combination of classical Chinese and modern Chinese. Unnecessary functional words like &quot;o'er&quot; are often omitted, for according to the Chinese poet, Yu Dafu (1898-1945), the Chinese language is characterized by often being disconnected formally but connected semantically. <br />\n<br />\nfaa1 kei4花旗 [Flower-Flag] <br />\n<br />\nThe title is rendered as faa1 kei4 piu1 piu1花旗飄飄 [Flower-Flag Fluttering],  instead of 星條旗 [Star-Stripe Flag], as in the other Chinese translations, for星條旗 [Star-Stripe Flag] is a strange combination in Chinese. faa1 kei4花旗[Flower-Flag] has actually been used by Hongkongers to describe the American flag for more than 100 years. The official Chinese name of the Citbank is still faa1 kei4 ngan4 hong4花旗銀行。飄飄 [Fluttering] also sounds lofty and jaunty. <br />\n<br />\nFor full text pls click: <br />\nFB link: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/752909328480167?__tn__=-R\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhongkongbilingualnews%2Fposts%2F752909328480167%3F__tn__%3D-R&d=0fhT0ZiErqSmjIt08Df9ogz7jHi%2Fw8vyA5J9XtqU0Cw%3D&h=0de5c258\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/752909328480167?__tn__=-R</a><br />\n<br />\nWeb link: <a href=\"https://www.hongkongbilingualnews.com/post/%E8%8A%B1%E6%97%97%E9%A3%84%E9%A3%84%EF%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E5%9C%8B%E6%AD%8C%E6%96%B0%E8%AD%AFa-new-chinese-translation-of-the-star-spangled-banner-by-chapman-chen-hknews\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hongkongbilingualnews.com%2Fpost%2F%25E8%258A%25B1%25E6%2597%2597%25E9%25A3%2584%25E9%25A3%2584%25EF%25BC%259A%25E7%25BE%258E%25E5%259C%258B%25E5%259C%258B%25E6%25AD%258C%25E6%2596%25B0%25E8%25AD%25AFa-new-chinese-translation-of-the-star-spangled-banner-by-chapman-chen-hknews&d=0fhT0ZiErqSmjIt08Df9ogz7jHi%2Fw8vyA5J9XtqU0Cw%3D&h=c0579dd4\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.hongkongbilingualnews.com/post/%E8%8A%B1%E6%97%97%E9%A3%84%E9%A3%84%EF%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E5%9C%8B%E6%AD%8C%E6%96%B0%E8%AD%AFa-new-chinese-translation-of-the-star-spangled-banner-by-chapman-chen-hknews</a> <br />\n<br />\n#americanflag #starspangledbanner #USnationalanthem #donaldtrump #maga2020 #trump2020 #chapmanchen #hkbnews #hongkongprotests #FrancisScottKey"}]}
