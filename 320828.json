I&rsquo;m stuck in here, and I don&rsquo;t have my phone. Please call my boss.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nOfficer Olden said at first people thought the note was a joke, but somebody eventually took it seriously and called authorities.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;We come out here, and sure enough we can hear a little voice coming from the machine,&rdquo; Olden said. &ldquo;So we are thinking this is a joke.
