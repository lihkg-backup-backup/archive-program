Many of these arrests were entirely arbitrary, with police officers interpreting the law at their own whim. For example, <span style=\"color: gold;\">children on their way back from extra-curricular activities were arrested for simply being near the site of a peaceful legal protest</span>. A teenage boy, who tearfully asked police officers on the street why they have lost all moral conscience, was pinned to the ground by police officers, bashed in the head with batons and then arrested. Parents of arrested children have expressed their concerns to the authorities but to no avail. The lunacy of these arrests is shown by the fact that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the vast majority of arrested children. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>Unrestrained Police Violence Against Children</strong><br />\nIn dispersing protest crowds, the police have shown no restraint in using armed force against younger protestors. Since the start of the social movement in June, many young protestors have been beaten violently until their teeth fell out and multiple bones were fractured. In the evening of 30 September, just one day before the expected China National Day mass protests, the police guidelines on the use of live rounds as well as other anti-riot weapons were relaxed, reclassifying batons as &ldquo;less lethal&rdquo; weapons despite their obvious propensity for causing life-threatening injuries. The next day, police started using live rounds without restraint, with <span style=\"color: gold;\">a bullet hitting an 18-year-old student in the chest at point-blank range. The police refused help from on-site first aid personnel</span> and left the severely wounded student unattended for over three minutes. The police did not bother to reflect on their unilateral escalation of violence, and only three days later, <span style=\"color: gold;\">another 14-year-old schoolboy was critically injured by another live round.</span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Depriving Legal Rights of Arrested Children</strong><br />\nFor children that had been arrested, the Police General Orders in Hong Kong provided for their right to contact their parents or guardians, to seek legal assistance, and for a social worker or trusted adult to be present at the time of arrest. But the police have shamelessly and repeatedly violated most of these provisions. Arrested children had their phones confiscated and were often not permitted to contact their family members.<span style=\"color: gold;\"> Many were not allowed to see a lawyer</span> until the time they faced a hearing in court. Younger children were sent to children&rsquo;s homes after they were arrested, despite not being charged, where <span style=\"color: gold;\">they had little chance to contact their family. Some children were forced to stay in confinement for up to a month before being released by court order</span>, with no chance to even apply for bail. <span style=\"color: gold;\">Children who suffered injuries often faced delays before they could seek basic medical attention</span>. Protecting the legal rights of arrested children is particularly important as they are vulnerable minors, but the police have flagrantly disregarded those rights on a daily basis."},{"pid":"b3df6e117713a59a96ddbf6af5f5ca897914f3ab","tid":1651506,"uid":151057,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-13T11:09:42.000Z","msg":"<strong>Creating An Atmosphere of White Terror</strong><br />\nThe Hong Kong government has consistently failed to respond to the demands raised by protestors, and is intent on curbing pro-democracy sentiment by brainwashing children and creating an atmosphere on white terror. Multiple pro-establishment politicians have <span style=\"color: gold;\">vowed to introduce compulsory national education to teach children to love the Chinese Communist Party </span>from a young age. On 9 October, Chief Executive Carrie Lam admitted at a press conference that the new Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation was targeted specifically at youngsters. Though the regulation does not cover school campuses, the Education Bureau issued a memorandum to all schools, including kindergartens, ordering them to implement the anti-mask policy in schools. The bureau suggested that students should be prohibited from wearing masks whether in or outside school campuses. <span style=\"color: gold;\">School administrations were required to report on the situation of students wearing medical masks regularly to the Education Bureau.</span> This is a gross violation of the students&rsquo; rights to political protest and expression both inside and outside the school campus. Practically speaking, students no longer even had the freedom of choice to wear a mask for other valid, apolitical reasons, such as prevention of infectious disease. The government is obviously willing to sacrifice children&rsquo;s welfare to hold onto its tyrannical power in Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nChildren&rsquo;s rights are being violated daily with impunity, <span style=\"color: gold;\">with children as young as 10 being subject to physical abuse, psychological torture and indoctrination</span> from a totalitarian government that was supposed to protect them.  <ins><span style=\"color: gold;\">We must continue fighting for the children of Hong Kong &ndash; they deserve the right to be free!</span></ins><br />\n<br />\nBy<strong><span style=\"color: gold;\"> Hong Kong Civil News Society (HKCNS)</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n===<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><em>我哋係抗爭者自發組織亦非大台<br />\nWe are an Independent civilian organisation,<br />\npledged to be the voice of Hong Kong's oppressed.<br />\n成立新聞社是為了抗衡政府及警察嘅抺黑<br />\n<span style=\"color: gold;\"><strong>HKCNS</strong></span> provides the counterbalance of smear tactics from the HKSAR government and its Police Forces,<br />\n將真正抗爭情況告知世界<br />\nRevealing to the world the truth of our cause.</em></span><br />\n===<br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">寫手不足﹑<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span style=\"color: gold;\">招募</span></span>！求義士協助度稿採訪編纂高質新聞稿｜限時有效｜</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://t.me/joinchat/JABufk663yTdXdU7ErWQhQ\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fjoinchat%2FJABufk663yTdXdU7ErWQhQ&d=uxh%2FksCcDU8UuFRsnlXnue%2FcXzH0lQqBACTLtzCSRXY%3D&h=3e6bbe72\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://t.me/joinchat/JABufk663yTdXdU7ErWQhQ</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFor more videos:<br />\n<br />\n1.
