A local group with native ties to Hong Kong plans to peacefully march on Saturday as part of a global demonstration to show support for the region.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the event organizers, Benjamin Wong, explained that the original reason behind the protests began with the Hong Kong government&rsquo;s refusal to withdraw their extradition bill. But then the reasons grew to include preservation of Hong Kong&rsquo;s judicial independence.<br />\n<br />\nAnother Utahn born in Hong Kong, who requested to remain anonymous, remembers the region for its thriving economy and exquisite culture. Presently, she has family and friends still living overseas. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really peaceful place,&rdquo; said Jane Doe. &ldquo;I enjoy the people. I enjoy the food. It was really safe. It&rsquo;s just a vibrant city. A place that you just fall in love with.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nDuring the past couple of months, Wong and Doe said it&rsquo;s been difficult watching the demonstrations develop overseas.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heartbroken. I wish I could be there physically. But I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very dangerous. The situation is dire in Hong Kong and that&rsquo;s an understatement. I have seen violence used by protestors, by police officers, I&rsquo;ve even seen the involvement of triad members.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt very anxious and stressed. Sometimes, I have to turn off the TV or take away my cell phone from Facebook,&rdquo; said Doe.<br />\n<br />\nWhile the demonstrations continue, Wong and four other Utahns with ties to Hong Kong are planning a peaceful, non-partisan march on Saturday.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;My biggest fear is people get hurt and that&rsquo;s the last thing that I want to see. I just want people to be able to resolve all concerns without the use of violence,&rdquo; said Wong. &ldquo;Despite your different opinions or political stance, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. We&rsquo;ll unite together to achieve a common goal and that is to send love, peace, and support to people in Hong Kong.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nDoe, who said she&rsquo;ll participate in the march, hopes it doesn&rsquo;t become a repeat of Tiananmen Square.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I do want Hong Kong to be great again. It&rsquo;s a great city. My ancestors and many, many other ancestors built this city. I&rsquo;d just hate to see something happen to it,&rdquo; said Doe.<br />\n<br />\nAs of Wednesday, airport operators have resumed in Hong Kong. But the protests have continued in Sham Shui Po, a residential area of Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nThe local march will take place at 10 a.m. on Saturday. Participants plan to meet at the LDS temple in downtown Provo.
