The activists said the Hong Kong officials had &ldquo;committed human rights violations&rdquo; by pushing undemocratic policies.<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile, at Admiralty&rsquo;s Civic Square, a separate group of independence activists interrupted a Lantau conservation forum, urging protesters to join the rally outside the consulate.<br />\n<br />\nWayne Chan, convener of the Students Independence Union, said their two causes were linked. Chan said the group also opposed the Lantau reclamation plan, and their appeal to the United States was a further step to pressure Chief Executive Carrie Lam and her administration.<br />\n<br />\nChan called on the US to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bill first introduced in 2015 by Senator Marco Rubio and others. It would grant authority to the US government to establish &ldquo;punitive measures&rdquo; against Hong Kong officials who suppress basic freedoms.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;As [Hong Kongers], we have to collect our voices to show the US government that we want this Act to come out very soon,&rdquo; Chan told HKFP.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The chief executive is actually destroying Hong Kong&rsquo;s core values, she is selling all of our things to mainland China. So we think this is violating human rights and democracy, so we think [the Act] can help Hong Kongers to fight the government,&rdquo; he added.<br />\n<br />\nAnti-reclamation protesters &ndash; including Chan and other independence advocates &ndash; reached their destination at Admiralty&rsquo;s government headquarters at around 6pm. Chan&rsquo;s group then left for the US consulate in Central shortly before 7pm.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/10/15/independence-activists-urge-us-punish-hong-kong-officials-rights-violations-scuffle-unfolds-outside-govt-hq/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hongkongfp.com%2F2018%2F10%2F15%2Findependence-activists-urge-us-punish-hong-kong-officials-rights-violations-scuffle-unfolds-outside-govt-hq%2F&d=o6wDr6ucdGZgXGGAOBDxVEjIoeaDRyeQRMy%2FzT52C%2Fo%3D&h=8bad5503\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/10/15/independence-activists-urge-us-punish-hong-kong-officials-rights-violations-scuffle-unfolds-outside-govt-hq/</a>"},{"pid":"b0adaec237624307d65cdce6ad30c533a89a2c96","tid":862498,"uid":184679,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-10-15T01:36:45.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/US-Consulate-rally-independence-4.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hongkongfp.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F10%2FUS-Consulate-rally-independence-4.jpg&h=d32f12b0&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\nIndependence advocates gather outside the US Consulate General in Central.
