There&rsquo;s nothing Protesters can do that will make them more aggressive, so as to shame them. They are unshameable<br />\nSurrounding police stations is now akin to standing in one spot and getting beaten like in 2014. <br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">Focus should now be on turning HK into a full on city in rebellion. That means political graffiti on a level never experienced before, all topped off with targeted guerrilla tactics with precise targets and exit strategies.<br />\nThe police tactic is now, let protesters gather, let a few of them break the law and then this gives them the pretext to stop anyone, anywhere on suspicion of committing a crime at a protest. </span></strong><br />\nOnce there was a time to come together as a gigantic wave. Now is the time to make it rain all across HK."},{"pid":"9e60a929c70cb07e5943fbbef17bd827e6ba6917","tid":1601206,"uid":49316,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-29T03:15:22.000Z","msg":"宜家係因應對家要變陣 ok?"}]}
