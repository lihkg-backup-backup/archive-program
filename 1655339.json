Easily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Big sanctions on Turkey coming! Do people really think we should go to war with NATO Member Turkey?&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe post prompted instant condemnation, with Vivian Bercovici, Canada&rsquo;s former ambassador to Israel, labelling it &ldquo;sheer insanity&rdquo;."},{"pid":"35cf064b2ea1ea4f74fb6190aa3d040459033dfe","tid":1655339,"uid":142965,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-15T04:20:26.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-twitter-kurds-isis-prisoners-turkey-syria-bombing-latest-erdogan-tweet-a9155051.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fus-politics%2Ftrump-twitter-kurds-isis-prisoners-turkey-syria-bombing-latest-erdogan-tweet-a9155051.html&d=P9V%2Fg5HR%2BYIczjwvlITT9LidffPqrKRYdMEHu3E%2BQw4%3D&h=b722a5f0\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-twitter-kurds-isis-prisoners-turkey-syria-bombing-latest-erdogan-tweet-a9155051.html</a>"},{"pid":"d658b749d5417baf05ddc21fcef5ee60e196884b","tid":1655339,"uid":332832,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-15T04:22:16.000Z","msg":"Trump fucked the Kurds over.
