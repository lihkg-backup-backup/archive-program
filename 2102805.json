Amazon workers are still allowed to view TikTok from their laptop browser, the company added.</span><br />\n<br />\nAmazon and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment.<br />\n<br />\nTikTok, which has been popular with young audiences in the United States, is owned by the Chinese tech company ByteDance. It has been under scrutiny in Washington for security reasons because of its ownership. Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, said on Monday that the Trump administration was considering blocking some Chinese apps, which he has called a threat to national security.<br />\n<br />\nLate on Monday, TikTok also said it would withdraw from stores in Hong Kong, where a new national security law from China was enacted. The company said it would make it inoperable to users there within a few days. TikTok has also said that managers outside China call the shots on key aspects of its business, including rules about data."},{"pid":"9af4274928cbf3b1f8e0eebb489014d0146a65c8","tid":2102805,"uid":278298,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-10T18:22:53.000Z","msg":"連侵侵死敵都出聲，應該離死不遠"},{"pid":"f98bcd8a3176648946fdf00aec6e41f25ae038c3","tid":2102805,"uid":122275,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-10T18:45:17.000Z","msg":"痴撚線email都睇到咪玩撚完？<br />\n但其實公司電話點解俾裝呢d on9 apps<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
