This movement would contribute to a tidal wave of resentment, he wrote, that would ricochet back as the kind of rancor that the left had tried to eradicate.<br />\n<br />\nRorty suggested that so long as &ldquo;the proles can be distracted from their own despair by media-created pseudo-events, including the brief and bloody war, the super-rich will have little to fear&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nBut as democratic institutions began to fail, workers would begin to realize that governments were &ldquo;not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or jobs from being exported&rdquo;, Rorty wrote.
