(emphasis added)<br />\n<br />\n(2) The Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap. 383) provides in Article 3, under the heading &lsquo;No torture or inhuman treatment and no experimentation without consent&rsquo; as follows:<br />\n<br />\n&lsquo;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&rsquo;<br />\n<br />\nThis is cross-referenced to ICCPR Art. 7 and is in identical terms. (The part I have left out deals with consent to medical or scientific experimentation which is not relevant for present purposes).<br />\n<br />\nFor completeness, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) at article 3, is in virtually identical terms:<br />\n<br />\n&lsquo;No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&rsquo;<br />\n<br />\nJust remember, however, what happened is also an offence under the HK Crimes (Torture) Ordinance) (Cap 427) which creates a specific offences of torture: Section 3 states:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&lsquo;(1) A public official or person acting in an official capacity . . . commits the offence of torture if in Hong Kong or elsewhere the official or the person intentionally inflicts severe pain or suffering on another in the performance or purported performance of his or her official duties.&rsquo;<br />\n<br />\n. . .<br />\n(3) For the purposes of this Ordinance, it is immaterial whether pain or suffering is physical or mental and whether it is caused by an act or an omission.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n. . .(6)A person who commits the offence of torture is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.<br />\n<br />\nThe Schedule to the Ordinance provides that it applies to the HK Police Force<br />\n<br />\nWhat happened likely constitutes offences under the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap 212) section 19 (grievous bodily harm) or, at the very least section 39 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm). Section 40 (common assault) does not seem serious enough for what the CCTV demonstrated."}]}
