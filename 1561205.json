Those arrested lined up with plenty of blood on their body.<br />\n<br />\n  This anti-gov movement has revealed that there is a terrifying interrogation room in Hong Kong for lynching.<br />\n  <br />\nAt the night of 11/8, a large group of protesters were arrested in Tsim Sha Tsui and was then sent to a remote and isolated San Uk Ling pound that is close to the border of China. After that, many of them were suffering from bone fracture for unknown reasons.<br />\nThere were also rumors about the arrested female protesters were sexually invaded.<br />\n<br />\n  A female protester, nicknamed Evil, were one of the arrested protesters. She stated that it was a terrifying 32 hours staying in the San Uk Lang detention center.<br />\n<br />\n  Evil is a pet groomer. She was arrested by the Special Tactical Contingent units on 11/8 night in Tsim Sha Tsui and was sent to San Uk Lang detention center. When she got off, she saw tall fences, as if she was sent into a birdcage. There are five lockup that looks like military barracks. Each lockup was split into 4 squares. Each square can at most hold 15 people.<br />\n<br />\n  According to the respondent, Lockup A was used for formalities work. Lockup C was used for resting for the arrested. There were no lights, window or even a clock. The police officer has to be equipped with a torch when entering the lockup. You would not be able to know if it was day or night in the lockup.<br />\n<br />\n Evil has been asking for lawyers and her family since she was arrested but were refused by the police. &ldquo;We (The arrested protesters) were asked to hold paper that was printed with name and bunch of numbers on it to take photograph. The evidence were placed on the floor &rdquo; said by Evil.<br />\n<br />\n  &ldquo;I saw the other protesters there. There were man and women. The police officers were rude to us, cursing us with foul languages. I heard some of us were having argument with another officers. Then I could hear the sound of hitting but I&rsquo;m not sure if he was beaten up, I can&rsquo;t see. I could only hear someone screaming for help. Later, I heard （possibly the officer）said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me! You got to remember me!&rdquo; After that, I saw a group of arrested protesters lining up at the door front. They were all male and were all seriously injured. There were plenty of blood on their body, their clothes, shoes and their faces. Their front teeth fell off. Their Chin were still bleeding. I cried immediately. I had eye contact with one of the male protesters. It seems like he was begging for my help. But I could do nothing. I did not know what to do. I was sad and enraged.&rdquo; Said by evil.<br />\n<br />\n  For her own safety, she was not dared to resist.&rdquo; We didn&rsquo;t know where we are and what would the police do to us. We could not talk with one another . If you attempt to speak, you might be the next person to be beaten up&rdquo; Said by Evil.<br />\n<br />\n  &ldquo;Some of us were bandaged in the head. There was blood stain on the gauze as well. Some of us were having swollen faces. One of us might have an allergy. His whole body were in red. He kept sweating non-stop. I can tell that he was really in a suffering by just looking at his face. There were also one of us kept pressing his stomach and he had a weak voice. They have asked for sending them to the doctors. However the officers only kept them waiting. It is fine that you arrested us, just hand us over to the court! Why do we have to be abused like this? It is ridiculous that being able to see cases of serious injuries in here, instead of in a hospital. Is this what minimum forces meant by the police? that everyone having a bloody face? This is terrifying! Is this still the Hong Kong that I know?&rdquo; Said by Evil."},{"pid":"4d2eba776e517c9cd30d24efbcffdd3c8cd47448","tid":1561205,"uid":278392,"like":10,"dislike":0,"score":10,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-11T13:47:00.000Z","msg":"Evil has been suffering from asthma since she was a child. She was having breathing difficulty during the detainment. She requested for taking medicine but were refused by the police. She was finally sent to a hospital for treatment 20+hours after her detainment. She saw many of the arrested protesters were either lying on the stretchers or sitting on wheelchairs. They were bandaged, having swollen face and exhausted. They were too tired for speaking even just a single word. They have their eye closed.<br />\n<br />\n  After Evil&rsquo;s medical treatment, she was sent to San Uk Lang detention center again. She spent totally 32 hours there back and forth.<br />\n<br />\n  In the dispersal by the riot police in 11/8, there were a total of 53 protesters arrested and were sent to San Uk Lang detention center. 5 of them had serious bone fractures after that. The police refused to admit their abuse towards the protesters.<br />\n&ldquo;Of course they were not admitting it because their actions were not recorded or noted. If you think a record is necessary for their action to become factual, this is totally bullshit.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n  For the late withdrawal of the extradition bill by Carrie Lam, Evil insisted that she will not accept it. &ldquo;They were physically abused by the police. They hit their head, their neck and their waist. This can cause long-term effects on their health. Who is going to pay for it?&rdquo; Said by Evil.<br />\n<br />\nShe recalled at the night of 11/8, she was at the frontline of the protest. She was in the 10th row at the frontline. When the riot police fired the tear gas, the protesters fell back. She felt someone was pushing behind her and she tried to push the young protesters in front. Her push has saved them from being caught by the police. &ldquo;I was lucky to be able to save the two kids. I was injured, but at least they were safe. The saw my being arrested from distance and they cried. I was touched because they remember me. It&rsquo;s worthy even if I were going to be charged of participating in a riot, because I&rsquo;m fighting for what Hong Kong should have.&rdquo; Said by E vil.<br />\n<br />\nThe young generation are sacrificing their future to defend the freedom of Hong Kong and to defend Hong Kong against the tyranny."},{"pid":"67b44736fb816edbe19b441e6226df46431c86b6","tid":1561205,"uid":123991,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-11T13:47:10.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"color:

room was freezing and all dark. Those arrested lined up with plenty of blood on their body.<br />\n<br />\n  This anti-gov movement has revealed that there is a terrifying interrogation room in Hong Kong for lynching.<br />\n  <br />\nAt the night of 11/8, a large group of protesters were arrested in Tsim Sha Tsui and was then sent to a remote and isolated San Uk Ling pound that is close to the border of China. After that, many of them were suffering from bone fracture for unknown reasons.<br />\nThere were also rumors about the arrested female protesters were sexually invaded.<br />\n<br />\n  A female protester, nicknamed Evil, were one of the arrested protesters. She stated that it was a terrifying 32 hours staying in the San Uk Lang detention center.<br />\n<br />\n  Evil is a pet groomer. She was arrested by the Special Tactical Contingent units on 11/8 night in Tsim Sha Tsui and was sent to San Uk Lang detention center. When she got off, she saw tall fences, as if she was sent into a birdcage. There are five lockup that looks like military barracks. Each lockup was split into 4 squares. Each square can at most hold 15 people.<br />\n<br />\n  According to the respondent, Lockup A was used for formalities work. Lockup C was used for resting for the arrested. There were no lights, window or even a clock. The police officer has to be equipped with a torch when entering the lockup. You would not be able to know if it was day or night in the lockup.<br />\n<br />\n Evil has been asking for lawyers and her family since she was arrested but were refused by the police. &ldquo;We (The arrested protesters) were asked to hold paper that was printed with name and bunch of numbers on it to take photograph. The evidence were placed on the floor &rdquo; said by Evil.<br />\n<br />\n  &ldquo;I saw the other protesters there. There were man and women. The police officers were rude to us, cursing us with foul languages. I heard some of us were having argument with another officers. Then I could hear the sound of hitting but I&rsquo;m not sure if he was beaten up, I can&rsquo;t see. I could only hear someone screaming for help. Later, I heard （possibly the officer）said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me! You got to remember me!&rdquo; After that, I saw a group of arrested protesters lining up at the door front. They were all male and were all seriously injured. There were plenty of blood on their body, their clothes, shoes and their faces. Their front teeth fell off. Their Chin were still bleeding. I cried immediately. I had eye contact with one of the male protesters. It seems like he was begging for my help. But I could do nothing. I did not know what to do. I was sad and enraged.&rdquo; Said by evil.<br />\n<br />\n  For her own safety, she was not dared to resist.&rdquo; We didn&rsquo;t know where we are and what would the police do to us. We could not talk with one another . If you attempt to speak, you might be the next person to be beaten up&rdquo; Said by Evil.<br />\n<br />\n  &ldquo;Some of us were bandaged in the head. There was blood stain on the gauze as well. Some of us were having swollen faces. One of us might have an allergy. His whole body were in red. He kept sweating non-stop. I can tell that he was really in a suffering by just looking at his face. There were also one of us kept pressing his stomach and he had a weak voice. They have asked for sending them to the doctors. However the officers only kept them waiting. It is fine that you arrested us, just hand us over to the court! Why do we have to be abused like this? It is ridiculous that being able to see cases of serious injuries in here, instead of in a hospital. Is this what minimum forces meant by the police? that everyone having a bloody face? This is terrifying! Is this still the Hong Kong that I know?&rdquo; Said by Evil."},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-11T15:19:50.000Z","msg":"點解用魔鬼做化名 Evil
