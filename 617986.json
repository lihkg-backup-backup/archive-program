If a student does not do well in any of these class, he or she will have a tough time in the University if he or she is admitted. Furthermore, it will be even harder for them to find jobs in the future to build on a successful career. However, I personally don't think the policy will help them do better in these classes.

In the remaining time without school, they will have to worry about their homework and potentially their academic assessments. By setting up this policy, it will decrease the amount of free time a student has and increase the stress level of a student. If a student's stress level is high, he or she will do even worse on academic assessments. On the other hand, all the students will have to take the DSE in the near future; therefore, they will have to have enough time to prepare for it. Having the compulsory tutorial class will drastically decrease their preparation time.<br />\n<br />\nTherefore, I have two suggestions to replace the idea of having a compulsory tutorial class. First, we shall still have a tutorial class, but we shall make it optional for students. At this age, students shall have their own judgement on whether they should seek help on the mentioned subjects. For those students, this can be helpful. Second, we can have discussions with the teachers to make classes more interactive for students to learn because our current learning methods are too conventional. For instance, for English classes, we can have videos and movies for students to watch. This allows students to improve their speaking and listening skills with an interest instead of solely doing past papers, which can help them to prepare for the DSE. <br />\n<br />\nUltimately, I welcome the idea of having a tutorial lesson, but making it compulsory will merely pile on the pressure on the students.
