The sun has been dazzlingly bright so you might just as well go for an outdoor onsen soaking up the sun 🌞 (by the way I&rsquo;ve just got out of an onsen and am drying myself on a towel😊) I recommend going to Fuji mountain 🏔 it&rsquo;s an arduous climb but it&rsquo;s worth it for the view from the top and the confidence you&rsquo;ll gain afterwards. I enjoy going to the annual winter carnival 🎡 and going on the thrill rides and eating pancakes and sushi, soaking up the nice Christmassy atmosphere. I once saw X Japan live at the Tokyo Dome Stadium 🏟 which was absolutely incredible. Even though they&rsquo;re past their prime they&rsquo;re still excellent musicians so don&rsquo;t sell them short. At the end of the last encore, they bowed onstage soaking up the applause 👏🏻 They were given a thunderous standing ovation. Again, going on holiday in Tokyo this summer is a safe bet since the Japanese yen has dropped fairly quickly over the past six and a half months. In addition, if you&rsquo;re going to stay at Hotel JAP Tokyo please remember the following because I work at the hotel 🏨😊: First of all, before washing your clothes 👔please remove coins and tissue from the pockets and put only eighty percent of the dirty clothes in the wash tub. This will ensure your clothes to get evenly clean and the washing machine will less likely be out of order. Please towel off the drum of the machine after each use so as not to cause mould to grow in the drum. Second of all, please don&rsquo;t turn the air conditioner up to more than twenty five degrees. Otherwise it won&rsquo;t blow cold air and will smell bad. Third, after cleaning the tables and toilet 🚽 please rinse a cloth and wipe them again so as not to cause discoloration. Lastly, please don&rsquo;t stick or nail anything to the wall as the paint will peel.<br />\n<br />\nEnjoy your time in Tokyo !"}]}
