The lyrics reflect protesters&rsquo; vow not to surrender despite a government concession to axe an extradition bill that sparked a summer of unrest.<br />\nAt the New Town Plaza in Sha Tin district, some 2,000 people spread across several floors chanted slogans before breaking out into song in an emotional scene, with some crying and many lifting their hands in the air. The crowd included families with young children, students and senior citizens, many of them not wearing masks, as the protesters have.<br />\nThe busy mall is linked to a subway station where police fired tear gas on Sunday after protesters vandalized the station.<br />\nLocal media showed singing taking place in at least four other malls, as well as in some spots including outside a subway station. The South China Morning Post said participants responded to online calls to gather and sing. Police were absent and the gatherings dispersed peacefully.<br />\nThe song has emerged at almost every protest since last week, including during a World Cup qualifier match on Tuesday with Iran where Hong Kong soccer fans booed at the Chinese national anthem before kick-off.<br />\nProtesters have widened their demands to include calls for direct elections for the city&rsquo;s leaders and police accountability. Many saw the extradition bill, that would have sent some suspected criminals to China for trial, as a glaring example of the city&rsquo;s eroding autonomy since the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.<br />\nMore protests are being planned this weekend to coincide with the Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, including another major rally in central Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://apnews.com/fd288d4209994ad1bc720c3754dae028\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2Ffd288d4209994ad1bc720c3754dae028&d=duP9xtlDTMOxgFFwFRXy%2FYnMh2OwnA7FCi%2BsKpr4SDY%3D&h=1016e4ce\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://apnews.com/fd288d4209994ad1bc720c3754dae028</a>"},{"pid":"a99c7b8c34838248212f31fa0d2f2a4fadf62bff","tid":1562728,"uid":123991,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-12T06:30:19.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"color: red;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong><div style=\"text-align: center;\"> <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />出黎呀 自由閪！ <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></div></strong></span></span><br />\n<strong><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span style=\"color: gold;\"> <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />五大訴求 缺一不可 <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></span></span></div></strong><br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://na.cx/i/aPJ3iwW.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FaPJ3iwW.png&h=bd74ec1d&s={SIZE}\" /></div>"},{"pid":"a72dae3424a19f48af41d4cc1ba76db33098b150","tid":1562728,"uid":14941,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-12T06:44:52.000Z","msg":"香港社運 ，唱k一向佔重要位置<br />\n<br />\n去六四最鐘意係唱k環節"},{"pid":"d79a149ab64ddafda42a141b65ce57d0da424c10","tid":1562728,"uid":24944,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-12T06:47:11.000Z","msg":"波羅的海國家當年有歌唱革命添"},{"pid":"d64b736e17c086aaa7dc72cfb479618559150993","tid":1562728,"uid":116800,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a72dae3424a19f48af41d4cc1ba76db33098b150","tid":1562728,"uid":14941,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-12T06:44:52.000Z","msg":"香港社運 ，唱k一向佔重要位置<br />\n<br />\n去六四最鐘意係唱k環節"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-12T06:56:11.000Z","msg":"所以咪輸足咁多年囉"},{"pid":"3485b32f0ae18598c4193d0c5070af9757760ee3","tid":1562728,"uid":105578,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-12T07:01:37.000Z","msg":"應該要持尊重既態度咁去唱，而唔係當吹流行曲咁唱"},{"pid":"3903a7eb3bd7204a737acbd3622bc57989a9345d","tid":1562728,"uid":27416,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-12T07:02:14.000Z","msg":"真係好柒弱智<br />\n死既死傷既傷坐十年既坐<br />\n燒完警署地鐵走去唱歌"}]}
