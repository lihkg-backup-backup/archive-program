According to <a href=\"http://ucanews.com\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fucanews.com&d=g0rGYIVa9wBzMQsZpoCyfkzHknCl6yzZyFDyfiap5zU%3D&h=d97930a1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">ucanews.com</a>, the tombstone of Bishop Li Hongye, who was appointed by the Vatican but not recognised by the government, was also demolished. Two priests from the same diocese were also driven out of their parish. In other areas, authorities have confiscated church property including religious materials, and removed or destroyed crosses. Children under 18 have been prevented from attending churches, and residents have been threatened with expulsion from education and employment if they &lsquo;believe in religions&rsquo;.<br />\n<br />\nProtestant churches in the province have experienced similar incidents. On 11 April, China Aid Association published a notice from the Pingyuan Neighbourhood Committee, dated 4 April, which orders Christians, Buddhists, Taoists, and Muslims to register with the government. Church leaders in the Province have been ordered to study the revised Regulations on Religious Affairs, which came into effect on 1 February 2018. Churches have also been ordered to fly the Chinese flag.<br />\n<br />\nIn a letter from a Henan Protestant, published by China Aid, the author reports that churches have been told to sing the national anthem and the song <span style=\"color: red;\">&lsquo;No Communist Party, No New China</span>&rsquo; in their services. Banners, posters and tiles with religious messages must be removed and destroyed; authorities have threatened to stop state support to Christians on low-incomes if they do not give up their religious beliefs. There are also numerous reports that under-18s are forbidden from attending churches.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2018, a number of developments have resulted in a severe tightening of state control over religious affairs. The revised Regulations on Religious Affairs include further restrictions on religious practice, including online religious expression, and contain special provisions on national security and foreign connections.<br />\n<br />\nAdditionally, on 21 March Chinese state media announced that the United Front Work Department, <span style=\"color: red;\">an agency of the Communist Party of China (CPC), will absorb the State Administration of Religious Affairs (SARA), effectively giving the Party direct oversight of religious affairs.</span> The same month, the state-sanctioned China Christian Council and Three-Self Patriotic Movement launched a five year plan to &lsquo;Sinicize&rsquo; Christianity, which reportedly includes plans to write a &lsquo;secular&rsquo; version of the Bible, revise other religious materials, and include teaching on socialism and patriotism alongside religious study.<br />\n<br />\nCSW&rsquo;s Chief Executive Mervyn Thomas said: &ldquo;The crackdown on Christians in Henan Province demonstrates the increasing pressure on religious communities in China. While the authorities claim that religious freedom is protected, the reality is that independent religious communities are subject to harassment, intimidations and other violations. Unregistered churches are being forcibly shut down. At the same time, churches registered with the government are being managed more tightly, and forced to show loyalty to the Communist Party. We call on the Chinese authorities to protect the right to freedom of religion or belief for people of all faiths in China, in all parts of the country, and to release those detained in connection with their peaceful religious practice.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"354332612f465691f5c559a35b02657121a89c31","tid":643607,"uid":99205,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-04-26T15:26:46.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"http://china.ucanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CH_five-year-plan-for-protestants2.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=http%3A%2F%2Fchina.ucanews.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F04%2FCH_five-year-plan-for-protestants2.jpg&h=735eb75f&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/102FC/production/_100700366_gettyimages-460819658.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fichef-1.bbci.co.uk%2Fnews%2F660%2Fcpsprodpb%2F102FC%2Fproduction%2F_100700366_gettyimages-460819658.jpg&h=aff93483&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-43645196\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fzhongwen%2Ftrad%2Fchinese-news-43645196&d=g0rGYIVa9wBzMQsZpoCyfkzHknCl6yzZyFDyfiap5zU%3D&h=aff0ee42\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fzhongwen%2Ftrad%2Fchinese-news-43645196&h=50117ab2\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-43645196</a><br />\n<br />\n網上流傳的「禁令」寫到，「中國於3月30日起，全網下架所有聖經銷售，其中淘寶、京東、微店、當當網、亞馬遜一本聖經也買不到。相關基督教書籍也陸續封殺、店鋪被銷戶。」<br />\n<br />\nBBC中文記者試驗了淘寶與京東兩家平台，發現無法找到《聖經》，但可以看到《聖經的故事》等相關書籍。<br />\n<br />\n三位網店經營者向BBC中文確認，最近自己店裏的《聖經》被下架。一位不願具名的店主表示，自己在淘寶的網店以前做《聖經》代購且銷售信仰相關商品，但3月初接到提示，開始刪除店內的代購鏈接，「3月30號已經是看到結果（的時候）了」。該店主稱，網信辦要求各大平台直接刪除有關產品，雖然沒有明確公告，但「如果這個形式你看不懂的話，你的店鋪就不會存在了」。<br />\n<br />\n一步一步將鬼佬野趕走<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a9c6eb3b6db6c441beac7e8f6b4882e85b6fd28b","tid":643607,"uid":14497,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-04-26T16:16:24.000Z","msg":"遲d比返個有中國特色既基督教你囉"},{"pid":"ab67f250643e66532af06649b277e291a94d7808","tid":643607,"uid":69994,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-04-26T16:19:27.000Z","msg":"中國或成最大贏家 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a8c173b29f32d60573cc877f14a479c1375492bc","tid":643607,"uid":71008,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-04-26T16:22:21.000Z","msg":"洪秀全 天兄<br />\n<br />\n習近平 天弟<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
