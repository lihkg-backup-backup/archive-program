could have stopped 95 per cent of its coronavirus infections if social distancing and quarantine started just THREE WEEKS earlier - but it did prevent more than 7million cases<br />\n<br />\nChina's swift enforcement of quarantine and stringent social restrictions following the COVID-19 outbreak prevented more than seven million people from catching the virus in the country, scientists say.  <br />\n<br />\nBut a study claims that 95 per cent of all infections in mainland China could have been prevented if the country opted to implement restrictive measures such as social distancing and case isolation three weeks earlier. <br />\n<br />\nBy the end of February, in mainland China alone, the number of COVID-19 cases totalled 114,325, the researchers estimate.  <br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">The academics estimate that the total number of cases in mainland China could have been up to 67 times higher - upwards of 7.6million people -  if no measures had been taken to restrict close contact and movement of people. </span><br />\n<br />\nResearchers from the University of Southampton estimate that early detection, case isolation and social distancing was more effective than travel restrictions in limiting the spread of the killer virus, but all measures helped curb the outbreak.  <br />\n<br />\nThe researchers claim a coordinated plan with targeted measures are effective in significantly reducing the spread of the virus. <br />\n<br />\nScientists assessed how effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were in Hubei, ground-zero for the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes the COVID-19 infection. <br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\"><br />\nA paper on medRxiv found that while the measures ushered out by the Chinese government were effective, earlier enforcement would have further prevented the contagion's spread. </span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">The study reveals that if interventions were conducted one, two or three weeks earlier, cases could have been slashed by 66 per cent, 86 per cent and 95 per cent, respectively. </span><br />\n<br />\nHowever, if conducted one, two or three weeks later than they were, the number of cases may have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, or 18-fold increase, respectively.  <br />\n<br />\nStudy author Dr Shengjie Lai, of the University of Southampton, said: 'Our study demonstrates how important it is for countries which are facing an imminent outbreak to proactively plan a coordinated response which swiftly tackles the spread of the disease on a number of fronts. <br />\n<br />\n'We also show that China's comprehensive response, in a relatively short period, greatly reduced the potential health impact of the outbreak.'"},{"pid":"7caf77f735771750848663327f995f5bef502fa7","tid":1933577,"uid":170229,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T11:04:01.000Z","msg":"China has now seen a downturn in the number of daily cases but the researchers suggest social distancing should be continued for the next few months in China.<br />\n<br />\nThe institution's population mapping group WorldPop, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation set up by the billionaire Microsoft founder, took anonymised data from China on both illness onset and movement patterns. <br />\n<br />\nA series of complex computer models allowed the researchers to investigate how specific measures would have altered the trajectory of the outbreak in China. <br />\n<br />\nIts findings revealed improved disease detection, isolation of cases and social distancing are likely to have been more effective than travel restrictions.  <br />\n<br />\nDirector of the University of Southampton's WorldPop group, Professor Andy Tatem, says: 'We have a narrow window of opportunity globally to respond to this disease and given effective drugs and vaccines are not expected for months, we need to be smart about how we target it using non-drug-related interventions. <br />\n<br />\n'Our findings significantly contribute to an improved understanding of how best to implement measures and tailor them to conditions in different regions of the world.<br />\n<br />\n'We are now focused on adapting this work to new settings beyond China to support response efforts. <br />\n<br />\n'Different countries may need different approaches, but we aim to help them make informed decisions on how best to put interventions in place.'<br />\n<br />\n<a
