He loves painting but alas he has no talent as a painter. He never really progressed beyond the stage of painting cartoon characters. He's been wondering about setting up a hotel business. I think its worth a try as he has a razor-sharp mind. My brother too thinks its worry giving it a go. He'll try to get sanctions for building it in a particular area in Central. I would've thought the government will sanction his plans."}]}
