While we are fully aware of the sentiments in our society, we are very concerned about the wellness and well-being of our students. <br />\n<br />\nIn any situation, violence can never be a means to resolve problems. Hong Kong&rsquo;s greatest strength &ndash; the rule of law &ndash; is one of its core values and the cornerstone of its success for decades. Sharing a common goal that Hong Kong will continue to be a pluralistic, free, accommodating and peaceful community, we hope people with different views yet on the ground of mutual respect, would build constructive conversations in a calm, rational and peaceful manner to resolve the current divisions. <br />\n<br />\nBest regards <br />\n<br />\nJin-Guang Teng <br />\nPresident <br />\n<br />\n <br />\n     <br />\n<br />\n各位同事、各位同學： <br />\n<br />\n對於七月一日立法會大樓的衝擊事件，我和你們一樣深感痛心。我們一方面十分明白社會上的情緒，另一方面也非常關注同學的安全和福祉。 <br />\n<br />\n無論在任何情況下，暴力始終不是解決問題的方法。法治是香港的核心價值之一，也是香港數十年來賴以成功的基石。我們希望本著共同的目標，令香港繼續成為一個多元自由、寬容和平的社會，冀盼各方即使持不同意見，仍能在互相尊重的基礎上，以冷靜、理性及和平的方式建立具建設性的對話，以化解當前的矛盾。 <br />\n<br />\n校長 <br />\n滕錦光"},{"pid":"b6b9b6f0aa063f8bcfee3898e0a3fd8996d2b20c","tid":1283706,"uid":273716,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-04T01:37:53.000Z","msg":"大灣區理工大學<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
