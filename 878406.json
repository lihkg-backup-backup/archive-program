The IIA variant comes with enlarged rocket motors and a bigger kinetic warhead, according to industry lead Raytheon.<br />\n<br />\nThe intercept occurred off the west coast of Hawaii, when an SM-3 launched by the guided-missile destroyer John Finn destroyed a target launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility at Kauai.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;This was a superb accomplishment and key milestone for the SM-3 Block IIA return to flight,&quot; Missile Defense Agency Director Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves said in a statement. &quot;My congratulations to the entire team, including our sailors, industry partners, and allies who helped achieve this milestone.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/1862/1048/a0ad8895-MissileMDA.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fa57.foxnews.com%2Fstatic.foxnews.com%2Ffoxnews.com%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F10%2F1862%2F1048%2Fa0ad8895-MissileMDA.jpg%3Fve%3D1%26tl%3D1&h=1fdacf5f&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;This second intercept for the SM-3 Block IIA is a success we share with the Missile Defense Agency and the country of Japan, our cooperative development partners,&rdquo; Taylor Lawrence, Raytheon Missile Systems president, said in a statement. &ldquo;Together, we are building the most advanced solutions for ballistic missile defense.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nTests have not always gone smoothly for the new SM-3 system. While the first system test in February 2017 was successful, a second test in June 2017 was washed out after a sailor accidentally triggered the missile&rsquo;s self-destruct feature by misidentifying it as a friendly target. A third test, held in January 2018, ended in a failure that cost taxpayers $130 million.<br />\n<br />\nSpeaking to reporters in March, Greaves emphasized that even in an intercept failure, MDA gains a wealth of knowledge from each test launch. As he put it then: &ldquo;If North Korea is learning as much as I&rsquo;m learning from these failures, we all ought to be concerned.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nAlong those lines, it is notable that the MDA statement said: &ldquo;Based on observations and initial data review, the test met its objectives. Program officials will continue to evaluate system performance.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"d1530fa6c6bde850a3f1d9c80b61c64e2db6f782","tid":878406,"uid":120678,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-10-27T06:27:00.000Z","msg":"今次攔截測試完整片段<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwJ9c6ZSyqI\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgwJ9c6ZSyqI&d=ohugl7sx8BWB9kVPH%2BgyFKEKYqckrLkk14koP0tj2xA%3D&h=e6b7c8e2\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwJ9c6ZSyqI</a>"},{"pid":"0cf523d8fa2e41f583a87b529a9f3a517ce521bf","tid":878406,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-10-27T06:27:49.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"04e2ecd22ac49e7a798bf9d310bdcc10695ee359","tid":878406,"uid":120678,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-10-27T06:48:04.000Z","msg":"同場加映：韓國準備購入SM-3反導攔截彈<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/photo.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/m.xinhuanet.com/mil/2018-10/17/c_129972999.htm\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbig5.xinhuanet.com%2Fgate%2Fbig5%2Fm.xinhuanet.com%2Fmil%2F2018-10%2F17%2Fc_129972999.htm&d=ohugl7sx8BWB9kVPH%2BgyFKEKYqckrLkk14koP0tj2xA%3D&h=0fb2987c\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/m.xinhuanet.com/mil/2018-10/17/c_129972999.htm</a><br />\n<br />\n美國《防務新聞》周刊網站10月13日發表了傑夫&middot;曾的題為《韓國將從美國購買一批艦載攔截彈道導彈的軍備》的報道。<br />\n<br />\n韓國參謀長聯席會議的一名高級指揮官12日透露，韓國軍方決定購買艦載&ldquo;標準3&rdquo;型（SM-3）攔截導彈，以挫敗對手可能發動的彈道導彈襲擊。<br />\n<br />\n報道稱，在回答一名議員有關SM-3導彈採購的問題時，參謀長聯席會議兵力建設規劃機構負責人金善弘少將説：&ldquo;這個決定實際上是在2017年9月的一次高級將領會議上作出的。&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n韓國武器採購部門沒有發布有關合同的新聞稿，這顯然是為了避免破壞與擁有核武器的朝鮮對話的氣氛。<br />\n<br />\n為了加強低端、末端階段的導彈防禦係統，美國陸軍的末段高空區域防禦係統2017年被部署在韓國南部。<br />\n<br />\n報道稱，SM-3旨在摧毀中短程彈道導彈。這種&ldquo;直接碰撞殺傷&rdquo;導彈已知能夠擊落150至500公裏高度的目標，而其最新型號SM-3 IIA型導彈能夠擊中1000公裏高度的目標。據制造商雷神公司説，SM-3攔截導彈的&ldquo;殺傷戰鬥部&rdquo;的威力相當于一輛時速600英裏的10噸重卡車的力量命中威脅目標。<br />\n<br />\n韓國軍方認為，SM-3將能有效抵禦源自高空的EMP電磁脈衝攻擊。<br />\n<br />\n報道稱，韓國參謀長聯席會議稱，採用SM-3的時間表尚未制定。"},{"pid":"f85336016a4efa793dcd5fac915b940f674ceba6","tid":878406,"uid":143499,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-10-27T09:09:33.000Z","msg":"除非中國成功自主研發高達唔係嘅話輸緊<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1cd385aea98f3ef57c2c24a6d0fd2ae9df27c7de","tid":878406,"uid":9564,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-10-27T09:15:02.000Z","msg":"東風21<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
