Mao&rsquo;s vanquished opponents fled to Taiwan and maintained the claim over all of China, referring to themselves as the Republic of China and keeping a United Nations seat under that name until 1971. China considers the island a province and has made recognition of the policy the foundation for diplomatic ties with the U.S. and other countries.<br />\n<br />\nThe misstep bearing the name of Press Secretary Sean Spicer shows the sensitivity of the issue. Before Trump took office, he publicly toyed with the idea of abandoning the &ldquo;One China&rdquo; policy that acknowledges China&rsquo;s claim over Taiwan and suggested that it could be a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.<br />\n<br />\nTension rose further after Trump tweeted about a protocol-breaking phone conversation with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Dec. 2 and subsequently questioned the One China policy in interviews.<br />\n<br />\nThree weeks into his presidency, Trump dropped the gambit, paving the way for a phone call with Xi and kicking off a relationship between the two which led to meetings at Mar-a-Lago in April and at the G-20 on Saturday.<br />\n<br />\nIn a gaffe in 2006, a White House announcer introduced &ldquo;the national anthem of the Republic of China&rdquo; as then-President George W. Bush and former Chinese President Hu Jintao stood together during the latter&rsquo;s visit to Washington.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEO7E94XYAAnnZ2.jpg\"
