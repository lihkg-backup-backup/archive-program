He said he travels to the Chinese mainland frequently and a couple of months ago: &ldquo;I was visiting the mainland and saw the bicycles at streets. And I thought there is something to do and I would like to bring and develop the concept in Hong Kong and the rest of the world.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nCohen saw very high growth potential for the bicycle-sharing business which has challenged certain markets. Cohen saw high potential in Hong Kong despite public areas available for cycling being limited.<br />\n<br />\nCompared with the business model of mainland bicycle-sharing companies such as OfO and Mobike, Cohen pointed out that Gobee.bike was similar but they will focus on more mature markets like Hong Kong where facilities are better built.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong&rsquo;s first bicycle-sharing system launched with over 1,000 smart bikes painted bright green spread out across key locations in the New Territories including bike-friendly districts like Sha Tin, Tai Po and Ma On Shan.<br />\n<br />\nCohen expected the number of bikes to reach 20,000 by July this year and Gobee.bike aims to cover most areas in Hong Kong &ndash; including Kowloon, Hong Kong Island, Discovery Bay and Park Island &ndash; by the end of this year.<br />\n<br />\nCohen said customers needed to pay a deposit of HK$399 (US$51.31) and sign a contract first through the brand&rsquo;s mobile application which is currently only available on Android phones; the IOS version is expected to be launched soon. A customer would locate the nearest bicycle through an interactive map. Cyclists need to unlock the bright green bikes they find on the street by scanning a unique QR code. They can park the bike at any designated public area. Gobee.bike&rsquo;s colleagues will handle management of the bikes.<br />\n<br />\nGobee.bike charges customers HK$5 per half hour and payments can be made directly through the mobile application by linking a credit card, the company says.<br />\n<br />\nCohen said the company has already finished the C seed round of investment and the round was led by Swiss Founders Fund, Cocoon Ignite Ventures, <a href=\"http://Lastminute.com\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2FLastminute.com&d=q%2BUwj3SihaKoadPXZHTFaWowyooGr0BEXXUM5gBrg7E%3D&h=f54a2012\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">Lastminute.com</a> group&rsquo;s founder and chairman Fabio Cannavale, Lamivoie Capital and Goldman Sachs alumni as well as individual investors.<br />\n<br />\nCohen said he had two other partners for this business and they had already established a team of 15 colleagues.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s not the first company Cohen has started.
