The journalist was also associated with a known fake Twitter account called Nas Daily (@NasDailyVideo). Over the past month, I tried my very best to investigate further on the issue, and here's the link to my detailed report (along with a TLDR version):<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong>Detailed report:</strong></span><br />\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPaTdFWnb-ePZJJi9xoR0Sli1dBcMjXN8RlRJPPKGoQ/edit?usp=sharing\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1sPaTdFWnb-ePZJJi9xoR0Sli1dBcMjXN8RlRJPPKGoQ%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&d=cH2nQL%2B7gNVGRZzFZPB6VqwvV4D0jUJVCqNn8v1PCJE%3D&h=c5c7eaf7\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPaTdFWnb-ePZJJi9xoR0Sli1dBcMjXN8RlRJPPKGoQ/edit?usp=sharing</a><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong>TLDR version:</strong></span><br />\n[詳細報告+懶人包] 上個月Twitter尼日利亞記者事件的進一步調查<br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1634666\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1634666</a><br />\n<br />\nThe report is only available in Chinese at the moment.

This is a repost.</strong> (As you might know) I posted yesterday on the 'Current Affairs' section, but it 'sank' rather quickly due to high internet traffic there. I believe quite a number of you (both LIHKG and Twitter users) know about the Nigerian press incident and I hope most of you could be fully informed via this repost.
