明天農民全國示威","createTime":"2018-12-09T16:16:29.000Z","updateTime":"2018-12-10T01:38:03.000Z","uid":32511,"like":13,"dislike":1,"uniUserReply":20,"replies":[{"pid":"f29d5705ac066ebe9a8389ae3fbc908c72f7d937","tid":934978,"uid":32511,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-12-09T16:16:29.000Z","msg":"法國巴黎第四個星期六黃背心示威，再發暴力打砸搶掠，所留下的破壞與瘡痍觸目驚心。巴黎市長今天肯定受到破壞的程度超過上個星期六。法國內政部下令動用前所未有警力雖然平息了示威者暴力，但沒有有效預防打砸事件與破壞程度加重。黃背心被多重力量鼓動繼續施加壓力，法國各界不敢談論因此而有的經濟損失。法國的黃背心抗議目前已經出口到其他歐盟國家。<br />\n <br />\n法國警方報告昨天共抓捕了1082名暴力示威者與打砸暴力分子。而上個星期六警方抓捕的暴力示威者只有412人。<br />\n <br />\n儘管警方對預防暴力與打砸搶劫，動用驚人警力與防暴配備包括裝甲車，但警方沒有能夠更好預防暴力事件發生。<br />\n <br />\n昨天的示威在巴黎多達數十個地方展開，警方奔波於各個戰略要塞。巴黎以外的地方，也發生不同規模的黃背心示威，並伴隨暴力與打砸，但巴黎的受損程度遠遠超過其他地方。<br />\n <br />\n巴黎黃背心示威白天暴力對峙基本被控制。但示威尾聲時加入了打砸分子。巴黎全城都發生商店被砸，各種店鋪被搶。很多商店都關門，但安全裝置也被砸壞，沒能躲過被砸被搶的惡運。<br />\n <br />\n法國政府昨天繼續與黃背心示威運動不同人士對話，但他們中間沒有正式的代表或發言人。總理菲利普表示對話開放。但黃背心沒有顯示停止運動不再示威的跡象。多家激進黨派鼓動黃背心抗議運動應當繼續向政府施壓。<br />\n <br />\n根據調查，黃背心示威運動以來暴力打砸破壞，因商家關門，法國與巴黎形象造成的後期訂貨多重損失，已經用十多億歐元計算。<br />\n <br />\n法國各界對黃背心抗議運動對法國經濟造成負面壓力增加擔心但不敢聲張。黃背心支持者斥責法國經濟社會文化政治精英與普通民眾斷層現象。<br />\n <br />\n根據英國媒體警告，法國黃背心抗議運動網絡煽動有俄羅斯身影，散布假新聞，張貼偽造照片，全部聚焦警方鎮壓黃背心示威者，嚴重打傷示威者，煽動黃背心仇警立場。<br />\n <br />\n據英國媒體警告，英國脫歐公投時，有俄羅斯假賬號活躍在脫歐爭議，數量多達幾十萬每天都推特推文，鼓動英國人投票脫歐。<br />\n <br />\n法國網絡安全部門正在調查，但謹慎出台報告。<br />\n <br />\n法國抗議運動不斷，明天開始全國農民上街示威，抗議農田難種，生活困難。法國政府斡旋協調多時，並加之以補貼增款，但仍然沒有能夠阻止農民被鼓動上街與黃背心抗議運動彙合。但據農民抗議運動說，他們不會與黃背心示威中暴力行為同流合污。<br />\n <br />\n法國總統馬克龍至今沒有發表講話。儘管示威者，各個反對黨派均聚焦嚴厲攻擊馬克龍總統本人，並發泄罕見的憤怒，馬克龍仍然沒有對全國講話。據各個黨派以及黃背心示威批評，馬克龍第一時間沒有回應滿足民眾憤怒，現在總統說什麼也都不能夠滿足抗議運動的要求。<br />\n <br />\n根據昨天巴黎以及全國各地的黃背心示威，統一口號已經是馬克龍必須下台。"},{"pid":"47c15f65f94be7f4a572abfaf14b8272f0463f12","tid":934978,"uid":158613,"like":8,"dislike":1,"score":7,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-12-09T16:23:06.000Z","msg":"法國總統馬克龍要有歐洲軍隊對抗美中俄"},{"pid":"5af22f09ca661d09bade79201d2d258bbcb50d0f","tid":934978,"uid":130105,"like":10,"dislike":1,"score":9,"quote":{"pid":"47c15f65f94be7f4a572abfaf14b8272f0463f12","tid":934978,"uid":158613,"like":8,"dislike":1,"score":7,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-12-09T16:23:06.000Z","msg":"法國總統馬克龍要有歐洲軍隊對抗美中俄"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-12-09T16:29:34.000Z","msg":"跟得d阿嬸多，個腦都有問題<img
