First, members of a political community commit to participate in the democratic process by voting to determine the laws and policies that affect their lives. The goals and motivations of their political participation may vary, but there is a shared attitude: maintaining control over their own lives and refusing to leave matters that profoundly affect their lives solely to the discretion of political leaders and bureaucrats. Second, a democratic way of life means a respect for other peoples&rsquo; political equality, and hence a respect for each individual&rsquo;s liberty and autonomy in everyday interactions. A democratic attitude encourages people to hold one another in mutual respect, so that &ldquo;all relationships, no matter how small or intimate the context, would be permeated by the principle that each person [has] equal weight&rdquo; (Anne Phillips, Engendering Democracy, 1991, p.160). A democratic attitude also means being able &ldquo;to put our own wishes and needs in perspective, to create some momentary distance from our enthusiasms and preconceptions so as to recognize the significance of what others have to say&rdquo; (ibid, p.161).<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://philosophynow.org/issues/101/On_Democratic_Theories\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fphilosophynow.org%2Fissues%2F101%2FOn_Democratic_Theories&d=TytWRGNO3s0Eety5H3eok6NFN85aI5NoQ2W41nR4Hcs%3D&h=8385d09f\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://philosophynow.org/issues/101/On_Democratic_Theories</a><br />\n<br />\n哲學家們講得這麼動聽，為甚麼西方民主國家今天<br />\n<br />\n1) 貧富懸殊越來越嚴重，貧窮人越來越多，連溫飽權都越來越少 <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2011%2F05%2Ftop-one-percent-201105&d=TytWRGNO3s0Eety5H3eok6NFN85aI5NoQ2W41nR4Hcs%3D&h=c78fb222\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105</a><br />\n<br />\n2) 壓制言論自由，囚禁whistleblowers，威脅逼害記者<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuQW0US2sJw\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZuQW0US2sJw&d=TytWRGNO3s0Eety5H3eok6NFN85aI5NoQ2W41nR4Hcs%3D&h=8f823699\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuQW0US2sJw</a><br />\n<br />\n3) 大財團凌駕法律，沒有制衡，嚴懲弱勢羣體<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/12/hsbc-prosecution-fine-money-laundering\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2012%2Fdec%2F12%2Fhsbc-prosecution-fine-money-laundering&d=TytWRGNO3s0Eety5H3eok6NFN85aI5NoQ2W41nR4Hcs%3D&h=5e5e0d89\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/12/hsbc-prosecution-fine-money-laundering</a><br />\n<br />\n4) Jimmy Carter 說美國是個oligarchy<br />\n<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/07/30/jimmy-carter-u-s-oligarchy-unlimited-political-bribery/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2F2015%2F07%2F30%2Fjimmy-carter-u-s-oligarchy-unlimited-political-bribery%2F&d=TytWRGNO3s0Eety5H3eok6NFN85aI5NoQ2W41nR4Hcs%3D&h=b8bece1e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://theintercept.com/2015/07/30/jimmy-carter-u-s-oligarchy-unlimited-political-bribery/</a><br />\n<br />\n為甚麼民主理論這麼動聽，現實社會越來越不濟呢？試舉例說明 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yeah.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n追求西方民主，是否要做到以上4項呢？試舉例說明 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yo.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5f50553e7eff315dd3426257abedc09a5898a050","tid":1184607,"uid":44073,"like":1,"dislike":7,"score":-6,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-03T18:32:12.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"7a4962512a3020d2c389f1fcc045f086143e9a79","tid":1184607,"uid":44073,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-03T18:32:30.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"96c1e4e6eeb9d1663fddf077dc3ed28b487d8173","tid":1184607,"uid":137344,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-05T03:28:07.000Z","msg":"世界表面係民主 自由 平等呢類價值至上<br />\n但從來都係資本至上<br />\n用資本論睇所有野會變得合理"},{"pid":"fd5422593cbed53b5732135deeed65fbd881fca8","tid":1184607,"uid":190811,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-05T04:37:56.000Z","msg":"哲學家講既係理想大同<br />\n現實係人性並不漂亮"},{"pid":"ec6614803a9b9f1a6cc531b3ffb5754123b6e643","tid":1184607,"uid":96708,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-05T10:36:28.000Z","msg":"如果哲學家講既野係實現到，佢地就唔係哲學家，係政治家啦"},{"pid":"ff28dc8ba86bb2110f29b50d0b9374cc7d1e1691","tid":1184607,"uid":251026,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-05T10:54:21.000Z","msg":"哲學家話要追求民主，民主會變oligarchy，追求民主=oligarchy，一開始做咩要追求民主<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/nosee.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
