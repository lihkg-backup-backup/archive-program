Many use the word to avoid directly stating that they were involved in unlawful activity.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>行街 Hahng Gaai (&ldquo;Shopping&rdquo;)</strong><br />\nSimilar to &ldquo;dreaming,&rdquo; the term &ldquo;shopping&rdquo; (literally to stroll around, or walk the streets) is used euphemistically to mean one was out at a protest. With clashes between police and protestors often occurring in busy retail districts that are home to glitzy malls, the &ldquo;shopping&rdquo; metaphor is oddly apt.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>黨鐵 Daung Teet (&ldquo;Communist Party Rail&rdquo;)</strong><br />\nEver since it started shuttering train stations closest to protest sites, the city&rsquo;s subway operator has been accused by protestors of siding with the police, who in turn are seen as an arm of the Beijing-backed government. Protesters have responded by vandalizing stations, destroying equipment such as ticket machines, and referring to the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) with this derogatory term, which rhymes with the actual name of the MTR in Cantonese.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>落雨 Lok Yu (&ldquo;Raining&rdquo;)</strong><br />\nWhen front line protestors shout &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining!&rdquo; it may actually be &mdash; Hong Kong&rsquo;s summers are notoriously wet. But most of the time, it&rsquo;s a shorthand way of saying &ldquo;Everyone open your umbrellas,&rdquo; often because police are about to use pepper spray.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>接放學 Zeep Fong Hok (&ldquo;School Pick-up&rdquo;)</strong><br />\nWhen clashes between police and protestors last well into the night, long after train services have stopped, chat groups on encrypted messaging app Telegram start buzzing with information about &ldquo;school pick-up&rdquo; services. Supporters of the protestors who have cars &mdash; or &ldquo;school buses&rdquo; &mdash; let protesters know where to meet them, how many people they can pick up, and which districts they&rsquo;re able to drive to.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>出魔法 Chut Morh Faht (&ldquo;Use Magic&rdquo;)</strong><br />\nTo &ldquo;use magic&rdquo; means to start fires. Sadly, it&rsquo;s a term that has gained traction in recent weeks as hardline protestors become increasingly reckless in their actions, setting barricades and other objects ablaze.<br />\n<br />\nsource：<a href=\"https://time.com/5668286/hong-kong-protests-slang-language-cantonese-glossary/?fbclid=IwAR2bZGg7o_gDDBsd_Mn3Ch6oO_Mi9j9NhA56acwJVqePLR6Sk2fObnqOdDc\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F5668286%2Fhong-kong-protests-slang-language-cantonese-glossary%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2bZGg7o_gDDBsd_Mn3Ch6oO_Mi9j9NhA56acwJVqePLR6Sk2fObnqOdDc&d=nKAZF5zAPcG2WvBXR7hnIm8HdWgMvHIPJs6XZvMXZMw%3D&h=edd4158b\" target=\"_blank\">https://time.com/5668286/hong-kong-protests-slang-language-cantonese-glossary/?fbclid=IwAR2bZGg7o_gDDBsd_Mn3Ch6oO_Mi9j9NhA56acwJVqePLR6Sk2fObnqOdDc</a>"},{"pid":"f520530885a6bb8359f0a754d069c39328bae63a","tid":1637177,"uid":251736,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T02:06:49.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"0dc91316a37d083f2798afe69de105c2644eb9f7","tid":1637177,"uid":77416,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T02:11:48.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"d6012bdef3434e9f720a72952e54d38e78ae0fcf","tid":1637177,"uid":243380,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T02:35:17.000Z","msg":"There is different kind of magic.. not necessarily fire."},{"pid":"a0541061cbec5ebf2a2a555da273d91a69f9bfb4","tid":1637177,"uid":33566,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"d6012bdef3434e9f720a72952e54d38e78ae0fcf","tid":1637177,"uid":243380,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T02:35:17.000Z","msg":"There is different kind of magic.. not necessarily fire."},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T02:42:10.000Z","msg":"Sure just like in RPG<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/cook.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ca9522cc52555a4804676ed2ed25a83e44dfccd8","tid":1637177,"uid":30453,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T02:51:58.000Z","msg":"Yung Mou and Wo Lei Fei ?"},{"pid":"194abe8d98fba7d3ab0f1c6f20b46641fcdbb23a","tid":1637177,"uid":279236,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T02:54:01.000Z","msg":"Upvote<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f11724aa378e40fa026d9534210d65c529a98f05","tid":1637177,"uid":184488,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T03:56:23.000Z","msg":"&quot;Renovation&quot;, &quot;Decoration&quot;, and &quot;Cash Punishment&quot;"},{"pid":"45991a7db3f6ee20d0ba49ebf8e9c3d00d679cde","tid":1637177,"uid":237465,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T08:42:50.000Z","msg":"落雨 Lok Yu (&ldquo;Raining&rdquo;)<br />\nWhen front line protestors shout &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining!&rdquo; it may actually be &mdash; Hong Kong&rsquo;s summers are notoriously wet.
