I highly recommend Ramen Menya in Shinjuku. They provide a range of broths to please sophisticated palates: chicken broth, pork bone broth, fish broth, miso broth and lastly spicy broth. The spicy broth is toned down to suit the palates of the tourists so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it being too spicy 🌶 Of course they too serve food adapted for their own palate. The richness of broths is outstanding which can tempt demanding palates. The ramen texture is perfect that will please the most refined palate. I highly recommend it. Another restaurant that I recommend is BBQ Fuji in Shinjuku. They serve the best quality of meat 🥩 in Japan. You can choose any cuts of beef you like for barbecue such as ribeye, sirloin, flank, rump, t-bone, tenderloin, round steak and so forth as I&rsquo;m sure all of you have a discriminating palate.😊 The meat texture is of high quality which can tempt sophisticated palates. Their barbecue equipment is of top quality as the food does not stick to the grill. It&rsquo;s not like ordinary grill on which you try to flip meat and it will not come loose. It sticks and tears, makes a mess and results in dry charred meat. Their barbecue solved this problem."},{"pid":"acf6dfe87e8a31729abedbd0943c4efd7b2e08d1","tid":1306219,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-11T08:49:46.000Z","msg":"I go to japan for my holidays every year. I enjoy riding the thrill rides and eating pancakes 🥞 and sushi 🍣 at the annual winter carnival 🎡 soaking up the nice Christmassy atmosphere. In addition the sun has been dazzlingly bright so you might just as well go for an outdoor onsen soaking up the sun ☀️ (by the way I&rsquo;ve just got out of an onsen and am toweling off😊)I recommend climbing Mount Fuji 🗻 Its an arduous climb but the view is worth it. In fact my friend who&rsquo;s just been there showed me his photos taken there by which I was awestruck. At night the outline of Mount Fuji 🗻 is clearly defined against the starry sky by which you&rsquo;ll be awestruck. There&rsquo;s a beautiful lake there which reflects the beauty of the stars and the shape of Mount Fuji giving a double view of the starry sky and the snow mountain 🏔 He said it was well worth it for the view from the mountaintop and the confidence that you&rsquo;ll gain afterwards. I work at Hotel JAP Tokyo. My friend accepted a commission for a sculpture from the hotel. I congratulated him on having been commissioned to make a sculpture for the hotel 🏨 since it&rsquo;s a once in a lifetime opportunity. Another friend of mine who is a marketer at the hotel was assigned to the Paris office the other day with which she&rsquo;s really pleased. I&rsquo;m very pleased about her promotion too. Again, holidaying in japan 🇯🇵 is your best bet as the yen 💴 has fallen dramatically over the last three months. If you&rsquo;re staying at Hotel JAP Tokyo please remember the following as I work there😊: First of all before washing your clothes please remove tissue and coins from the pockets and put only seventy percent of the dirty clothes in the wash tub. This will ensure your clothes to get evenly clean and the machine will less likely be out of order. Please wipe the drum with a towel after each use so as not to cause mould or mildew to grow in the wash tub. Second of all, please don&rsquo;t turn the air conditioner up to more than twenty five degrees Celsius. Otherwise it won&rsquo;t blow cold  🥶 air and will smell bad. Third after cleaning the tables and toilet 🚽 with detergent or sudsy water, please rinse out a cloth or handkerchief with clean water 💦 and wipe them again so as not to cause discoloration. Lastly, please don&rsquo;t stick or nail anything to the wall as the paint will peel.<br />\nEnjoy your time in Tokyo !"}]}
