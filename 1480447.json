My friend Jason has got a commission to compose a waltz for the pageant as one of the contestants will be showcasing her waltz dance which we all can't wait to see. I should like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to him for having received a commission for a waltz from the pageant since it's a rare opportunity. I too endorse the congratulations on having progressed through the preliminary round. She's a contestant in the beauty contest and i won't be surprised if she progresses through the semifinal."},{"pid":"8d6a174a54153a95042ec7203f661202c00480ed","tid":1480447,"uid":242834,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"6aac161a6d723514e83c37e0b7f8ceed3875ff49","tid":1480447,"uid":152432,"like":15,"dislike":0,"score":15,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-17T10:14:59.000Z","msg":"港姐"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-08T06:22:12.000Z","msg":"秒<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1fa1fdf045bfc5d134a38987186a3ceb04dc43fa","tid":1480447,"uid":20816,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-08T08:28:15.000Z","msg":"港妓"}]}
