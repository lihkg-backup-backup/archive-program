Ever since the anti-extradition bill movement broke out back in early June 2019, the Hong Kong police were constantly using unnecessary brutality towards protesters, journalist and even first aiders. And now Hong Kong has became a Police State where you could be arrested just because you are wearing a black tee-shirt.<br />\n<br />\nThe police is entirely out of control. They have been ignoring all those police protocols and even violated the Geneva Conventions. They shoot protester, first aiders and journalist right in the eye with a bean bag bullet, there were 3 people who have lost their eye sight permanently because of that.<br />\n<br />\nOn the 31st of August, the Hong Kong police rushed into the Prince Edward metro station, brutality beaten up normal citizens, not matter whether they were protestors or not. Some of them were beaten up to unconscious, they should have been taken to the hospital right away but nobody knows where they are right now! There are also mysterious suicide cases happening in Hong Kong right after the 8/31 terror attack. There are rumors saying there are 6 people who was beaten up to death by the police and when their family tired to meet them, the police would lock them up and tried to silence them. <br />\n<br />\nWe the Hong Kongers are now suspecting that those &ldquo;suicide cases&rdquo; are just the cover up for the truth. We urge the MTR (metro company) to hand out the CCTV of that day in order to let us have to bigger picture of whether the police killed the protesters. All we wanted to know is the truth. As you guys have posted a video on youtube on 3rd of August, supporting us Hong Kongers to fight against this brutal regime, we sincerely hope that our peers are safe and sound, and if not, we do not want to let the murders police to get away easily!
