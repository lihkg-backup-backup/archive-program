At the &quot;rolled-up hearing&quot; to be held on 31-Oct and 1-Nov, he will be joined by Justice Anderson Chow Ka Ming. Section 32 of the High Court Ordinance provides that CFI proceedings will be heard by a single judge (with a jury in criminal trials). For non-criminal hearings such as this one, there is only one exception to the rule: under Section 32(3), the Chief Justice of HK may direct that any proceeding, or class of proceeding, in the CFI &quot;shall be heard and determined by 2 or more judges of the Court.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThis is very rare, and the fact that Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma Tao Li has made this direction appears to emphasise the importance of this case, which we explained in our analysis Carrie Lam and the Separation of Powers (8-Oct-2019), and the one before that, Making laws via the ERO may be unconstitutional (4-Oct-2019).<br />\n<br />\nWe don't know what the dynamics of a 2-judge CFI hearing will be - for example, there is no room for a majority decision, so there will be pressure, or at least some expectation, on the judges to agree a unanimous decision rather than produce two opposing judgments!<br />\n<br />\nIn any event, whichever side loses is almost certain to appeal to the Court of Appeal and then to the Court of Final Appeal. If the Government loses in the CFA then it may become the Court of Semi-Final Appeal if the HK Government once again seeks an interpretation from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress under Basic Law Article 158.<br />\n<br />\n&copy; <a href=\"http://Webb-site.com\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2FWebb-site.com&d=bp2T%2F%2B5c5q8hcpZmRI3qNlHO27hz5fVRhbnvZL2FK%2Bg%3D&h=62addd74\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">Webb-site.com</a>, 2019<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://webb-site.com/articles/ERO2.asp\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwebb-site.com%2Farticles%2FERO2.asp&d=bp2T%2F%2B5c5q8hcpZmRI3qNlHO27hz5fVRhbnvZL2FK%2Bg%3D&h=2a08ed25\" target=\"_blank\">https://webb-site.com/articles/ERO2.asp</a><br />\n<br />\n點睇？<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/think.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"bb8896a6ae06cfb85d3e1c368375598176533938","tid":1667097,"uid":47605,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-21T09:26:50.000Z","msg":"不如全港黨鐵靜坐聲討721啦<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/fight1.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <a href=\"https://lih.kg/1665580\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1665580</a> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/fight2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"3ff7eceb2536e938d6bf94829288c6df252d3745","tid":1667097,"uid":217542,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-21T09:27:03.000Z","msg":"[突發] 北角好似有手足出事<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1665948\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1665948</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<br />\n幫手推 未有報導<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"23dd263e8637ee1b158d5f6701685e54a33445cc","tid":1667097,"uid":265168,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-21T10:05:03.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span style=\"color: violet;\">想贏嘅同我入嚟<br />\n快啲把握最好時機</span></span></strong><br />\n<br />\n係時候搞個 尊重宗教自由大遊行<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1665685\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1665685</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"97ee74067c4512998e7407ce8a0150450c17793b","tid":1667097,"uid":81113,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-21T12:06:58.000Z","msg":"不如直接宣布一國一制啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c85934d2d5acf632778c6dcaa67e0328f87855b6","tid":1667097,"uid":327740,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-21T12:08:22.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"6d4da04120b93089d54957793f22badb8bd884ff","tid":1667097,"uid":271068,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-22T13:37:20.000Z","msg":"cls,<br />\n如果有兩個judge 唔同意見，就會變成佢兩個人的背景壓力，變個背景勢力大，就聽邊個，<br />\n完全違反普通法，judge 要無任何壓力下作出裁判的架構。<br />\n此舉已經違反基本法。"}]}
