But given the losses in equities -- Shenzhen&rsquo;s stock benchmark is down 33 percent in 2018 -- there&rsquo;s a growing risk that brokerages will be forced to sell the shares, accelerating the downturn.<br />\n<br />\nAt least 36 companies have seen pledged shares liquidated by brokerages since the start of June, more than triple the 10 in the first five months of the year, according to company filings. At least two firms announced after Monday&rsquo;s close that their shares were at risk of forced selling, including Jilin Zixin Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., which plunged by the 10 percent daily limit the following day.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;There&rsquo;s a liquidity crisis in the stock market, and pledged shares are again starting to sound the alarm,&quot; said Yang Hai, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities Co. &quot;If there are no real policies to cure the array of problems and ailments in our market, no one will be willing to take the risk.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nAbout 4.24 trillion yuan ($613 billion) of shares have been pledged as collateral for loans, according to Bloomberg calculations using China Securities Depository and Clearing Corp. data, accounting for about 11 percent of the country&rsquo;s stock market capitalization.<br />\n<br />\nForced selling is adding to the long list of issues facing investors in China&rsquo;s $5.3 trillion market, from worsening trade ties with the U.S. to concerns of slowing domestic demand and a slumping yuan. In a sign of how bearish sentiment is, the outstanding balance of margin debt on China&rsquo;s exchanges has fallen to four-year lows.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nStocks in the hi-tech hub of Shenzhen have been worst hit, partly due to the dominance of privately-run startups. The city&rsquo;s equity index is on pace for its worst year since 2008, while about one-fifth of the gauge&rsquo;s more than 2,000 stocks have lost at least half of their value.<br />\n<br />\nThe central government has taken steps to limit forced selling, but it&rsquo;s failed to slow this year&rsquo;s $3 trillion rout.<br />\n<br />\nBrokerages were told to seek government approval before selling shares pledged as collateral for loans, Bloomberg News reported in June, while the top financial regulator said in August it&rsquo;s closely watching corporate stock pledges.<br />\n<br />\nEven a meeting by the chief securities regulator with investors last weekend didn&rsquo;t engender confidence: The Shanghai Composite Index slumped 2.3 percent in the two days through Tuesday to a four-year low.<br />\n<br />\nGoing Local<br />\nEfforts to contain the risk posed by share pledges seem to growing.<br />\n<br />\nState-owned companies and a brokerage in Beijing&rsquo;s technology innovation district of Haidian set up a 10 billion yuan fund ($1.4 billion) to support listed non-state-backed technology firms, the local CSRC branch said this week. Authorities in Shunde, a manufacturing hub in Guangdong province, are considering providing liquidity to some local listed companies, Caixin reported, citing a preliminary plan seen by its reporter.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The risks in share-pledged loans will continue to grow if the stock market falls further,&quot; said Shen Bifan, chief strategist at Shenzhen Spruces Capital Management Co. &quot;Major shareholders usually tend to increase collateral to avoid forced selling. The problem is that some borrowers have already pledged everything they have.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&mdash; With assistance by Ken Wang, April Ma, Mengchen Lu, Sofia Horta e Costa, Ludi Wang, Amanda Wang, Fu Yin Ip, Shuyang Huang, Chuan Shen, Hao Du, and Eric Tang<br />\n<br />\n(Updates prices.)"},{"pid":"d67dee2b8f8efe64025ba4afde89602afd103e61","tid":886447,"uid":47359,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-11-04T07:09:09.000Z","msg":"全國廣播公司：特朗普政府　否認正尋求達成　中美貿易協議<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://lih.kg/bKEpOS\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://lih.kg/bKEpOS</a><br />\n<br />\nLIHKG @ Android"},{"pid":"57f575f4eae8281e45d20e540992c1613aa411d1","tid":886447,"uid":47359,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"d67dee2b8f8efe64025ba4afde89602afd103e61","tid":886447,"uid":47359,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-11-04T07:09:09.000Z","msg":"全國廣播公司：特朗普政府　否認正尋求達成　中美貿易協議<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://lih.kg/bKEpOS\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://lih.kg/bKEpOS</a><br />\n<br />\nLIHKG @ Android"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-04T07:10:19.000Z","msg":"全國廣播公司報道，特朗普政府否認正尋求達成中美貿易協議。（美聯社）<br />\n<br />\n中美元首通電話，國家主席習近平希望中美經貿問題達成一個雙方都能接受的方案。美國總統特朗普說，重視美中經貿合作，願意趁出席阿根廷二十國集團峰會期間會面。<br />\n<br />\n彭博早前報道，特朗普已經指示官員，起草中美貿易協議的內容，不過，全國廣播公司引述一名特朗普政府高級官員表示，特朗普正尋求與中國達成貿易協議的報道，並不真確。<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1426373-20181102.htm\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.rthk.hk%2Frthk%2Fch%2Fcomponent%2Fk2%2F1426373-20181102.htm&d=w%2FTjyry8MbikErwJX0oMg%2F6YfqAiA4jm3R2Vm1010vU%3D&h=049527a4\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.rthk.hk%2Frthk%2Fch%2Fcomponent%2Fk2%2F1426373-20181102.htm&h=52f2339d\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1426373-20181102.htm</a><br />\n<br />\n傳川普盼與中達協議 CNBC：美官員否認<br />\n<br />\n（中央社華盛頓2日綜合外電報導）針對媒體報導，美國總統川普正就可能與中國達成的一項貿易協議進行準備，CNBC記者今天推文引述川普政府高階官員加以駁斥。<br />\n<br />\n路透社報導，CNBC記者賈弗斯（Eamon Javers）發推文引述未具名高階政府官員說，談判「還有很長的路要走」。<br />\n<br />\n彭博今天稍早引述熟知內情人士報導，川普希望跟中國國家主席習近平達成協議，已要求美國官員草擬可能的條款。<br />\n<br />\n白宮官員未立即針對彭博報導回覆置評的要求。（譯者：何宏儒）<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/02/reuters-america-update-1-u-s-official-denies-report-of-possible-china-trade-deal-cnbc.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2018%2F11%2F02%2Freuters-america-update-1-u-s-official-denies-report-of-possible-china-trade-deal-cnbc.html&d=w%2FTjyry8MbikErwJX0oMg%2F6YfqAiA4jm3R2Vm1010vU%3D&h=8230bf12\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/02/reuters-america-update-1-u-s-official-denies-report-of-possible-china-trade-deal-cnbc.html</a><br />\n<br />\nUPDATE 1-<br />\nU.S. official denies report of possible China trade deal -CNBC<br />\n<br />\n(Adds details from CNBC, background)<br />\n<br />\nWASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A senior Trump administration official on Friday dismissed as untrue a media report that U.S. President Donald Trump was readying a possible trade deal with China, a CNBC reporter said in a post on Twitter.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;There is a long way to go,&rdquo;
