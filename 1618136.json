The approval of the case concerned may contradict your screening and selection principles, violate your country&rsquo;s core values and even pose potential human rights threats to your territory.<br />\n<br />\nAs understood in media reports, TSE and LEE are currently attempting to migrate to the United States and has entered the country. TSE holds high position in the HK Police Force, currently serving as commander of the Hong Kong Police Public Relations Branch. He has appeared at numerous press conference in Hong Kong speaking on behalf of the Hong Kong Police in suppressing basic human rights and humanity issues, including declarations that deprive medics and reporters of a safe and fair rights to exercise their duties. TSE has repeatedly used misleading wordings to whitewash the severity of police abuse of power and force in public press conference, which leads to a stronger deployment of force among frontline officers because of his endorsement as the department&rsquo;s public relations spinner.<br />\n<br />\nUnder the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act Section 212(a)(2)(G), foreign government officials and their immediate family members, who are responsible for, or have carried out particularly severe violations of human rights, are inadmissible for entry into the United States.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, There is reasonable doubt that TSE may carry out espionage activities in the United States. TSE&rsquo;s comments in publicly broadcast press conference reveals not only the Lines-to-take of the government but also his personal stance. It is obvious that TSE serves the HKSARS government under the rule of Chinese CPC government and supports totalitarian one-party leadership. It is a reasonable doubt that TSE may carry out espionage activities when given the right of abode in your territory, endangering the homeland security of America."},{"pid":"61ff31a7edd3d35cea4d1fea683a12284288d615","tid":1618136,"uid":320043,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-04T04:25:33.000Z","msg":"繼續<br />\nOut of human rights and homeland security concerns, I kindly pledge to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to review, and revoke TSE, LEE and their family&rsquo;s citizenship status and rights of abode and deny their entry to the United States.<br />\n<br />\nThank you for your attention in this matter.
