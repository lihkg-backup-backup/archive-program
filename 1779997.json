Why should China be any different?</span></span></strong><br />\n<br />\nWe have slowly but surely allowed ourselves to become extremely reliant on China in our zealous pursuit of expanding our trade and commercial interests. And in doing so, we have become complacent to the egregious human rights abuses in China. We have no one to blame but ourselves. However, there comes a time when we can no longer be bystanders.<br />\n<br />\nOur current approach in dealing with China will only serve to embolden the regime. Even now, Cong Peiwu, China&rsquo;s ambassador to Canada, has threatened us&mdash;not once, but twice&mdash;about imposing the sanctions. Peiwu said that if Parliament adopts our motion, there will be &ldquo;very firm countermeasures.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nCanada and the world must not bow to these types of threats from China. Too much is at stake. Former Canadian ambassador to China, David Mulroney, has described some of the policies of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China as &ldquo;the greatest threat to human freedom on the planet,&rdquo; while another former ambassador, Guy Saint-Jacques has advised that &ldquo;the only language China understands is one of firmness.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThis is the reality that our government must face up to.
