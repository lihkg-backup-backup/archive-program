This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S., 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree. Also, the Tariffs can be.....<br />\n...completely avoided if you buy from a non-Tariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That&rsquo;s Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That&rsquo;s why China wants to make a deal so badly!...<br />\n..There will be nobody left in China to do business with. Very bad for China, very good for USA! But China has taken so advantage of the U.S. for so many years, that they are way ahead (Our Presidents did not do the job). Therefore, China should not retaliate-will only get worse!"},{"pid":"a57cbd1c4bd0fdcb55c89c5cbed2e9f42f669223","tid":1153517,"uid":189798,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-05-13T16:30:20.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"f9e649122b30fce7beededfd0bbf7fc4859cf062","tid":1153517,"uid":51620,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-05-13T16:30:35.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
