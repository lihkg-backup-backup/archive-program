So far, I am exploring various options of integrated facial detection/recognition.<br />\n<br />\nIn one of the photos I posted, I took two faces of the police officers from the video that captured the stealing incident, and then I compared the two faces to see if they are the same officer. The method I used outputs a probability of 90% match.<br />\n<br />\nImportance: this integrated analyses will allow me to detect which police officers have been involved in suppression of protests.
