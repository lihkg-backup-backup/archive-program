The high influx of visitors has sparked complaints from residents, with local community group Tung Chung Future launching a &ldquo;reclaim Tung Chung&rdquo; action group to report illegal tour groups.<br />\n<br />\nLegally, mainland tour guides must be accompanied by a local liaison in Hong Kong, but some mainland guides have been leading tour groups alone. Tourism sector lawmaker Yiu Si-wing previously urged the police to arrest illegal guides.<br />\n<br />\nWong Chun-yeung<br />\nWong Chun-yeung.

The police sent more than 100 officers to the scene.<br />\n<br />\nThe group urged tourists sitting outside shops to leave, and asked mainland tour guides to show their licences. Police took away suspected illegal tour guides for investigation.<br />\n<br />\nWong also took aim at tourists sitting on steps in front of shops: &ldquo;I hope you can follow civilised rules &ndash; just stand up and it&rsquo;s fine, thank you.&rdquo; Wong said that his actions remained verbal.<br />\n<br />\nA tourist from Zhongshan said there was no mainland tour guide when they entered Hong Kong: &ldquo;We have four hours of free time to walk by ourselves.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nWong Chun-yeung<br />\nWong Chun-yeung urging mainland tourists to not sit on shop steps.

If not for you guys, it would be impossible for us to live here,&rdquo; one female resident told Wong as she hugged him. &ldquo;We Tung Chung residents support young people to come out to help.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nWong said he will continue with similar action, albeit with a lower profile. He said the government should limit the number of mainland tourists, and warned that diverting them to other areas will not solve the problem.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I am concerned it will only spark &lsquo;reclaim&rsquo; actions in each area,&rdquo; he said.<br />\n<br />\nWong Chun-yeung<br />\nWong Chun-yeung.

A 59-year-old man was arrested for a separate case of common assault.<br />\n<br />\nA dozen members of the pro-Beijing group &ldquo;Treasure Group&rdquo; launched a counter-protest in Tung Chung urging residents to welcome mainland tourists, since Hongkongers and mainland people are &ldquo;compatriots.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nTung Chung mainland tour guides<br />\nPolice jotting down details of mainland tour guides.

She urged them to lower the volume.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Reclaim&rdquo; action activists asked to have a conversation with Ip, but she did not respond. Ip was escorted away by dozens of police officers."},{"pid":"b7180b02335dc3bb630442c411118335e76dec9d","tid":899445,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-12T12:54:55.000Z","msg":"wu mao free thread <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6a31bb3c74dbb6ad1cc61ac12ef093fdb4b8c442","tid":899445,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-13T08:32:25.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7e8ba8dbeb55ca57c00f16557cb313d8005469a8","tid":899445,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-13T09:56:44.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
