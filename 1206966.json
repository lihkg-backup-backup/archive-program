The amendment would allow Hong Kong Government to extradite fugitives to countries and regions that are not signatory of formal extradition treaty with Hong Kong, including China mainland. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAccording to pro-Beijing newspaper Wenwei Po, citing source close to the central government, Chinese authorities could demand Hong Kong government to extradite foreign nationals who were considered a threat to national security to mainland China. However, it is clear from past experience that Chinese authorities had abused National Security Law to restrict freedom of speech, also to censor and persecute dissidents. The Extradition Law would effectively extend applicability of Chinese National Security Law to Hong Kong. <br />\n<br />\nThis raised the possibility that (your country name) citizens residing in Hong Kong would be exploited by Chinese government as political hostages and extradited to China on dubious and even fabricated charges. Since it is highly unlikely that any law courts in mainland China could provide a fair trial to defendants, due to heavy political influence on Chinese judicial system, the Extradition Law is a true threat to personal safety, assets and freedom of (country name) citizens currently living in Hong Kong. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nOn the basis of such, I wish you could reflect my concerns to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Your Excellency's country and the corresponding Central Government. I also wish Your Excellency's Government could also join the rank of American and European allies to take an official stance against the amendment of Extradition Law. <br />\n<br />\nThank you very much for spending time to read this and your attention.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nRegards,<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMr. X (passport number: X)<br />\n<br />\nMr. Y (passport number: Y)<br />\n<br />\nMs. Z (passport number: Z)<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n12th June, 2019<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n地址喺到：<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.protocol.gov.hk/eng/consular/asia.htm\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.protocol.gov.hk%2Feng%2Fconsular%2Fasia.htm&d=Q0Uk0WlElUZ8hxv%2Fjb96J9E6lK5ze4L1B2G6UiHaG78%3D&h=f035109c\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.protocol.gov.hk/eng/consular/asia.htm</a><br />\n<br />\n幫個手！"},{"pid":"787469233cfb99042db91928a7179a78556c6749","tid":1206966,"uid":159913,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-12T04:37:39.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bzluga/police_officers_use_a_water_canon_on_a_lone/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fpics%2Fcomments%2Fbzluga%2Fpolice_officers_use_a_water_canon_on_a_lone%2F&d=Q0Uk0WlElUZ8hxv%2Fjb96J9E6lK5ze4L1B2G6UiHaG78%3D&h=d57f2086\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bzluga/police_officers_use_a_water_canon_on_a_lone/</a><br />\n有reddit ac嘅請前往upvote，推香港公安上全球首頁<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n主post: <a href=\"https://lihkg.com/thread/1206673/page/1\" target=\"_blank\">https://lihkg.com/thread/1206673/page/1</a><br />\n得閒入post幫手推，好多人仲on99推緊舊post(公海完全冇人睇到) </span>"}]}
