promoted the idea with senior aides, reportedly presenting the letter to Steve Bannon, the president's chief strategist.<br />\n<br />\nHe believes the Commonwealth alliance fits well with Mr Trump's foreign policy outlook.<br />\n<br />\nThe president, for example, is said to have expressed his desire for India to be a &quot;true friend and partner&quot; in a phone call with Narendra Modi, the country's prime minister.<br />\n<br />\nMr Lake wrote in his letter that opening a Commonwealth branch in America would help the UK and the US &quot;find imaginative ways&quot; in which they could work together. <br />\n<br />\nMr Wigmore told the Telegraph the response from the White House was &quot;very positive&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nThough Mr Lake has not yet received a formal confirmation, discussions are said to be already underway to establish the office in New York. <br />\n<br />\nIt is part of an effort by Mr Lake to raise the profile and relevance of the modern Commonwealth, seeking to make it more of a factor in matters of foreign policy.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It has been very introspective, it needs to more extrovert,&quot; he said. &quot;In that sense we have adopted a policy of getting branches of the Commonwealth in non-commonwealth countries.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe idea, he said, is to promote  &quot;mutually advantageous&quot; links with &quot;reliable friends&quot; around the world on everything from business to defence. <br />\n<br />\nThe advantage of the Commonwealth, Mr Lake said, is that it operates less formally than governments, as a loose arrangement that is furthered by common values and culture.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It works because companies find it easier and more congenial to work in Commonwealth countries,&quot; he said.<br />\n<br />\nA new branch of the RCS has already opened in Helsinki, acting as a Baltic-Scandinavian hub, to help facilitate business ties with Commonwealth countries.<br />\n<br />\nLast year the RCS opened a chapter in Dublin, as part of a campaign to help persuade the Republic to rejoin the alliance of 52 member states."},{"pid":"26368b627ce95eb680821105452141844589234a","tid":138159,"uid":47714,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-02-28T11:20:44.000Z","msg":"Last year the RCS opened a
