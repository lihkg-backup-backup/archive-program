We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Once your messages (including your chats, photos, videos, voice messages, files, and share location information) are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. Your messages are stored on your own device. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline), we may keep it on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it. To improve performance and deliver media messages more efficiently, such as when many people are sharing a popular photo or video, we may retain that content on our servers for a longer period of time. We also offer end-to-end encryption for our Services, which is on by default, when you and the people with whom you message use a version of our app released after April 2, 2016. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them."},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-09T05:53:47.000Z","msg":"根本就係，既然佢一開始話 2月8日 唔同意條款就刪 account<br />\n咁佢延唔延都刪，廢事比佢不斷拖，實際繼續偷"},{"pid":"e2e08ad42d5bb00dbd7e9b6c1fd0cdf49b1171af","tid":2400598,"uid":281306,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"5c9ea12140b2d28818e668c3810e29c75917d2f2","tid":2400598,"uid":55597,"like":4,"dislike":1,"score":3,"quote":{"pid":"7b44756f94719a215be44278ce7d3212c4bfcfc7","tid":2400598,"uid":281306,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"b9881b17f3408cda5fe98a3d75281a5b43080210","tid":2400598,"uid":55597,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-09T05:43:58.000Z","msg":"5月15日<br />\nwhatsapp: 我地會再延長政策時間到 YYYY年MM月DD日 比使用者<br />\n香港人：YYYY年MM月DD日 再算，繼續用 whatsapp"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2021-02-09T05:48:35.000Z","msg":"其實一直賣緊資料，依家只係更新條款<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/5womc5q.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2F5womc5q.jpg&h=4246677b&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nLast modified: July 20, 2020 (archived versions)<br />\n<br />\nInformation We Collect<br />\nWhatsApp receives or collects information when we operate and provide our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.<br />\n<br />\nInformation You Provide<br />\nYour Account Information.
