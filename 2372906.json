They had a warrant to search my home because according to them, a BB gun had been posted to my address in April 2020 to which I never actually received. <br />\n<br />\nAround 10 policemen came to raid the apartment and the official reason for the arrest was &ldquo;possession of a firearm without license&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nBB guns are legal in HK however they said that particular BB gun had an energy output beyond what was legally allowed and therefore is considered in the same category as a real firearm. <br />\n<br />\nHowever nothing was found and I was taken away for processing at the airport branch police station. <br />\n<br />\nThe police had full knowledge of who I was and some were even fans of my work. When I challenged them on the arrest on such ridiculous grounds, they had indicated that the order came from another department higher up and stated they were just doing their jobs. <br />\n<br />\nDuring my conversations with the police, they also referred to my satirical appearances at public demonstrations that I had made throughout the year in 2020 including my appearance at IFC, July 1st and Oct 1st in support of the democracy protesters, which points to my suspicions that this arrest was not really about the bb gun. <br />\n<br />\nAs a professional impersonator of Kim Jong Un I often make use and own a number of replica BB guns, missiles and nuclear bombs for my performances and videos.<br />\n<br />\nIn my opinion this was an arbitrary arrest for my satirical critique of the CCP government in the years past and this arrest is being used as a tool not only to harass but to also take my finger prints (every person who gets arrested have their prints taken) had my iphone confiscated and my home searched. <br />\n<br />\nI have not yet been charged and had to pay for bail and report back to the police station every 6 weeks. I will once again have to report to them today -  where they will have the option to either charge me, drop the case or make me report back in another 6 weeks.<br />\n<br />\nSince I was made to report to the station back in December, I made sure that it was documented and arrived in character at the police station with my rocket to highlight the ridiculous grounds of my arrest. <br />\n<br />\nPlease DM me if you need to know further details.<br />\n<br />\nHoward X<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/361346080650226/posts/3571075433010592/?d=n\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F361346080650226%2Fposts%2F3571075433010592%2F%3Fd%3Dn&d=CthjHxCXz%2Bl0vOF3eBkmerV8WQSydv6El4C3YWjT4Eg%3D&h=57c42bb0\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/361346080650226/posts/3571075433010592/?d=n</a>"},{"pid":"6ad3ec36c6b7fe8dde1dfcec24a767caf1461b65","tid":2372906,"uid":133534,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-20T05:19:54.000Z","msg":"Pish"},{"pid":"75b7890506b0fde1777c8aa971252fd3385cf588","tid":2372906,"uid":91721,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-20T05:20:26.000Z","msg":"up"}]}
