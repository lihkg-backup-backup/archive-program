The executive said the number of people affected likely remains in double figures overall. The person said the increase was due to requests for information about pro-democracy activists.<br />\n<br />\nThe increasing use of bank records in questioning activists, which has not previously been reported, shows police in the Chinese-run city are using the full extent of their powers to investigate people suspected of breaking the stringent national security law which was introduced on June 30, according to the six activists.<br />\n<br />\nSome of the banks involved include HSBC Holdings Plc and its Hang Seng Bank Ltd subsidiary, Citigroup Inc unit Citibank and Standard Chartered Plc. Representatives of those banks declined to comment on individual accounts.<br />\n<br />\nBanks in Hong Kong have little choice but to comply with police requests, the senior bank executive told Reuters: &ldquo;The aggrieved party can go to the court if they think their accounts were frozen or their transaction details were shared for wrong reasons, but there&rsquo;s very little we can do here.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nA Hong Kong police representative declined to comment on why officers were seeking activists&rsquo; financial records, saying the department would not disclose details of its operations or investigations. The Hong Kong government did not respond to a request for comment on how or why police sought the bank information of arrested suspects.<br />\n<br />\nPolice in Hong Kong, as in most places in the world, have long been able to request customer information from banks as part of criminal investigations. Reuters could not determine whether the national security law has made it easier for police to get hold of individuals&rsquo; bank records.<br />\n<br />\nThe law does not mention access to bank information. It does give authorities the power to seize funds they believe are the proceeds of, or are intended to be used for, breaking the national security law. Authorities have not announced the seizure of any funds under that provision.<br />\n<br />\nA spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which regulates the banking sector, said: &ldquo;Financial institutions are expected to cooperate with (law enforcement agencies) on investigations and law enforcement actions.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"f462ecdd40937d52e23cca79cc276a8a7fc90d6b","tid":2380978,"uid":85751,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-26T09:19:16.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"bd734a402f7bc2dc9d468ca2044f682145ab7ec7","tid":2380978,"uid":123738,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-26T10:22:03.000Z","msg":"通常犯法野都係狗做<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c116f724369b8ee5ee95d3097aa026d9cbb3ca3d","tid":2380978,"uid":53498,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-26T10:25:04.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6e6eabc8a0e30eee2769bb8ace22717eaa9d8264","tid":2380978,"uid":238475,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-01-26T10:36:21.000Z","msg":"用 &quot;疑點行益歸於被告&quot;
