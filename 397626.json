The two leaders also met on the sidelines on the G20 summit in July. <br />\n<br />\nTrump is set to attend the U.S.-ASEAN summit and the East Asia summit in the Philippines in November, as well as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam. <br />\n<br />\nChina&rsquo;s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Trump&rsquo;s potential visit. <br />\n<br />\nJapanese public broadcaster NHK cited unnamed diplomatic sources saying that Trump was also considering visiting Japan and South Korea during his Asian tour in November. <br />\n<br />\nIn February, Trump accepted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&rsquo;s invitation to visit Japan by the end of the year. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The February agreement is still valid. We would definitely like to make it happen sometime within this year. But no specific timing has been fixed yet,&rdquo; a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said. <br />\n<br />\nAlso, the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun said on Wednesday Japan, the United States and South Korea are in final stages of talks to hold a trilateral summit on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. <br />\n<br />\nThe newspaper, citing unnamed government sources, reported the meeting between Trump, Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in could take place on Sept. 21 and would focus on bolstering cooperation in response to North Korean provocation. <br />\n<br />\nOn Monday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously voted to step up sanctions on North Korea, with its profitable textile exports now banned and fuel supplies capped. <br />\n<br />\nAfter several days of negotiations on the resolution, Washington dropped several measures to win the support of Russia and China, including a bid for an oil embargo and the blacklisting of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the national airline. <br />\n<br />\nIn Hong Kong, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told the South China Morning Post the results of a U.S.-led investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property theft would be announced before the Beijing summit to reset bilateral trade. <br />\n<br />\nThe far-right architect of Trump&rsquo;s 2016 election victory, Bannon told an investor conference, organized by a unit of China&rsquo;s largest brokerage, that Trump and Xi had a rapport that should enable them to work out differences, said an attendee at the meeting which was closed to the press. <br />\n<br />\nBannon, who was let go by Trump last month, told a private lunch gathering in Hong Kong that he still &ldquo;speaks with President Donald Trump every two to three days,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported."},{"pid":"532dacb9697eeb431d129b892be807655b8c3a3b","tid":397626,"uid":28195,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-09-13T06:04:55.000Z","msg":"支蛆又打哂飛機"}]}
