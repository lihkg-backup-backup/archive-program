Darmian and Vrsaljko fit that mold, but it is possible that Napoli take their time to make a decision. This is also because Inter is in pole position for Vrsaljko and they are talking to his agent to understand what his salary would be. The Nerazzurri are preparing a similar offer to what they made for Politano: a generous loan deal with a mandatory buyout clause. It is the only way forward for them at the moment. Atletico wants to sell him outright. It remains to be seen what formula would satisfy the Spanish club.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://gianlucadimarzio.com/en/napoli-interested-in-darmian-and-vrsaljko-the-latest\"
