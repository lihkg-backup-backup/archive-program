The reason for this is to generate news materials that are favourable in CCP's propaganda programme and a reason for the terrorist organisation to exert lethal forces on peaceful protesters.<br />\n<br />\nThink about it, the goal that we are trying to achieve tomorrow is to let the US know, we, the Hongkongers do not accept what Carrie Lam has proposed and to show the support for the 'Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act'. (Fun fact: Carrie Lam is just playing with the art of wording and she has no intention in withdrawing the extradition bill, but delaying the implementation of it) <br />\n<br />\nIt's obvious that the US is not our enemy, and such act is beneficial to the current state of Hong Kong. With these being said, nobody should have the motive to siege the United States Embassy tomorrow, unless they have the intention to stop the act from passing.<br />\n<br />\nSo<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\">Whoever stirs things up or try getting people to siege is likely to be a terrorist, undercover. </span></span> I believe you guys know what to do to these terrorists when you see one of them <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSee you all tomorrow!<br />\nChater Garden @ 13:30<br />\nUnited States Embassy @ 14:00<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/VDUmo6F.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FVDUmo6F.png&h=27731c3c&s={SIZE}\" /><img src=\"https://na.cx/i/AFBcvMG.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FAFBcvMG.png&h=0b41e71a&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"04846930b16939b86b0e13bc1ad70647ce0d3edd","tid":1549949,"uid":310864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T13:35:08.000Z","msg":"Dear LIHKG brothers and sisters, may I please ask you to spend 5 seconds of your time bumping this post so it gets seen by more foreigners?<br />\n<br />\nCheers<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"640ccf3ff2bff819a0b94e80e7cf65f3c10411d1","tid":1549949,"uid":182994,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T13:48:04.000Z","msg":"［暗黑兵法］警察撞鬼 撒溪錢策略係正確<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1549968\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1549968</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"714f8637912c79ad9ee8bda57b4a41a0cedecad6","tid":1549949,"uid":306614,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T14:58:54.000Z","msg":"wow good English<br />\nWhowever vandalizes the US Embassy must be an undercover from HK police or the CCP!"},{"pid":"03a3a0a57fc30da6ffa7e2cb3cf7783fa4172b97","tid":1549949,"uid":310864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T16:53:52.000Z","msg":"Bump, again <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wail.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
