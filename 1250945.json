They go as far to say that de Ligt will move to Juventus in a transfer worth &euro;70 million, with the Ajax captain set to make a salary upwards of &euro;20 million &mdash; we don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s gross or net &mdash; per season if he does indeed move to Turin.<br />\n<br />\nSky Sport Italia transfer guru Gianluca Di Marzio also had some de Ligt-related news on Friday. He didn&rsquo;t go as far as De Telegraaf did by saying that a deal is close to being done between Juventus and Ajax, but Di Marzio stated that &ldquo;confidence is growing and the situation is now in the hands of Juventus&rdquo; regarding a move for de Ligt. Di Marzio also says that Juve&rsquo;s Chief Football Officer Fabio Paratici will back on the hunt to try and get a deal done come the weekend.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n全世界加盟祖記系列<br />\n<br />\n山齊士<br />\n馬些路<br />\n里昂中場尼當比利<br />\n賓菲加新星菲歷斯<br />\n羅馬中堅文奴拿斯<br />\n費倫天拿翼鋒基艾沙<br />\n伊斯高<br />\n華拉尼<br />\n占士<br />\n尼馬<br />\n普 巴<br />\n大力臣<br />\n馬達<br />\nDe ligt<br />\n拉比奧特"},{"pid":"8a9a29270f3fe9c9f3b328a48949fe75b5f43b9d","tid":1250945,"uid":217509,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-06-22T09:53:59.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"aa5da7626686bc4c4ed993e0c260d0a9208cdad3","tid":1250945,"uid":40932,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"8a9a29270f3fe9c9f3b328a48949fe75b5f43b9d","tid":1250945,"uid":217509,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-06-22T09:53:59.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-22T09:58:06.000Z","msg":"唔洗或，d報紙佬唔戴頭盔都無俾人告"},{"pid":"e4521c0fa797201aa583c96ad5f196bbe4ce57d0","tid":1250945,"uid":34571,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"8a9a29270f3fe9c9f3b328a48949fe75b5f43b9d","tid":1250945,"uid":217509,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-06-22T09:53:59.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-22T10:07:04.000Z","msg":"又關你事既"},{"pid":"43db8b562e5b6fa8dd70b0f77c763a6b761b54dd","tid":1250945,"uid":22628,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-22T10:09:25.000Z","msg":"獌都有百鳩幾個傳加入添<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"fc7501070b05e355ce1c6a91c3e0d7dd4bcdfe1b","tid":1250945,"uid":12628,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-22T10:10:22.000Z","msg":"我來季會加盟蛆踢右後衛，敬請各位期待"},{"pid":"16cfebfb0768ec044685a62b9b09e78796670810","tid":1250945,"uid":34571,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-22T10:11:46.000Z","msg":"Adrien Rabiot will sign for Juventus<br />\nJUNE 20, 2019<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.juvefc.com/adrien-rabiot-will-sign-for-juventus/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.juvefc.com%2Fadrien-rabiot-will-sign-for-juventus%2F&d=Hh5C2Wm8JWR9usSbwEl%2Bh9XOzSaib9VKtZEsb4jNOpA%3D&h=6cf3c9ea\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.juvefc.com/adrien-rabiot-will-sign-for-juventus/</a>"},{"pid":"6cc47e7f0a1d435d469a02f545981b33276b8cb9","tid":1250945,"uid":67225,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"43db8b562e5b6fa8dd70b0f77c763a6b761b54dd","tid":1250945,"uid":22628,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-22T10:09:25.000Z","msg":"獌都有百鳩幾個傳加入添<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-22T10:48:57.000Z","msg":"獌無人先係新聞"}]}
