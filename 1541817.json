Here&rsquo;s why.<br />\n<br />\nBefore passing your judgment on our refusal to accept Carrie Lam&rsquo;s version of withdrawal of the bill, the first thing that we can all agree on is that we have come a long way from where we were three months ago. Little did we know then that the extradition bill would open up a Pandora&rsquo;s box that set in motion the unfathomable that cost us whatever was left of our trust in the government, our respect for the police and our expectation of the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; policy.<br />\n<br />\nToday, after months of condescendence, resistance and bloodshed, Carrie Lam has finally deigned to &ldquo;move a motion&rdquo; to withdraw the bill. What we thought would be a simple announcement at the Legco meeting to formally withdraw the bill turns out to be a heinous trick to pass the bill. As suggested by Carrie Lam, the government would move a motion at the second reading of the bill to be resumed when the Legco Council meeting reconvenes in October, which would then be voted by the Legco members consisting of a majority of the Pro-Beijing camp. If and when a simple majority of the Legco members objects to the motion to withdraw the bill, and the motions for second and third reading are agreed to (which would be an easily achievable task for them), the bill could eventually be passed by the Legco, letting Carrie Lam off the hook.<br />\n<br />\nSo no, we are not impressed by Carrie Lam&rsquo;s feeble attempt to appease the public and the international community. We are on the brink of the abyss and, in all honesty, at the end of our tether, but we fear that if we give in now, if we give up now, we will risk having to lose everything we hold most dear. A timely quote from Mandela reminds us that courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. We only hope that you would give us the benefit of the doubt. Stand with us, fight along our side. Freedom comes at a price, but we never learnt just how high the cost was until three months ago. We will not yield until our five demands are met. We will not succumb.<br />\n<br />\nFive demands, not one less."},{"pid":"64f01b65b35a9ae6c0d34075e4970b8f2a717ba0","tid":1541817,"uid":117906,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T16:13:59.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">撤LLM 對準政權</span></strong></span><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/3E7OjKb.gif\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2F3E7OjKb.gif&h=66b4ea40&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/zNutjAi.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FzNutjAi.jpg&h=1817afe5&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: orange;\">得到黨媒認證</span></strong></span><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/sELTeyX.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FsELTeyX.png&h=0e8c0efe&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">#Chinazi旗係一個符號，不斷向世界輸出反共思想！</span></strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span style=\"color: orange;\">#Chinazi 赤納粹</span></span></strong><br />\nChinazi就係China+Nazi。<br />\n赤=共產紅色恐怖, 納粹不解釋。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span style=\"color: orange;\"> 全民反共 對準政權！</span></span></strong><br />\n黑警、黨鐵，港共全部都係人民既敵人<br />\n而背後一直有一個終極大Boss中共<br />\n<br />\n呢一刻中共絕對係十個煲得兩個蓋，準備爆煲。<br />\n今日唔號召世界圍堵中共，更待何時？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span style=\"color: orange;\">用#Chinazi黎connect全世界</span></span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: orange;\">1.
