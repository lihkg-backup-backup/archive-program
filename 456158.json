Customers who have already placed an order should also see their arrival times improve, and MacRumors readers are already reporting decreased wait times. <br />\n<br />\nThe new shipping estimates are an improvement from the 5 to 6 week estimates we saw just after pre-orders sold out. Estimates have not yet improved in North America, so we're still seeing 5 to 6 week wait times in the United States, but the better shipping estimates should soon expand to all launch countries. <br />\n<br />\nApple's iPhone X is on the verge of launching, and the first orders will arrive to customers in New Zealand and Australia in just a few hours. Apple Stores will be opening at 8:00 a.m. local time across the globe for in-store sales."},{"pid":"0ebe56c7064ce391b1b4e2a054ba1dc83c78b657","tid":456158,"uid":64181,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-02T17:11:25.000Z","msg":"快檢查！首批 iPhone X 出貨了！<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n滿心期待的各位，是否一直在檢查 iPhone X 到底出貨了沒呢？在上週末，其實就可以發現 iPhone X 已經是在準備出貨的狀態，直到現在，首批 iPhone X 終於開始出貨啦！<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://static.newmobilelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/iPhone-X-5-1068x601.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.newmobilelife.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2FiPhone-X-5-1068x601.png&h=abbc0b74&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n由於筆者本身有搶訂到第一批的 iPhone X（台北），因此期待的心情和各位一樣。雖然我在今日中午察看時發現 iPhone X 仍是在「準備出貨中」的狀態，但現在終於變成了「已出貨」，各位不妨打開 Apple Store 應用程式或是在 Apple 官網中看看你的訂單，說不定你的 iPhone X 也已經出貨了喔。<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://static.newmobilelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/iPhone-X-Shipment.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.newmobilelife.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2FiPhone-X-Shipment.jpg&h=59d0b8d4&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"0741fcc440de0d74e76f80bc06d41f5f19d2e85d","tid":456158,"uid":64181,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-02T17:15:43.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e4114013bf090674b4a29ba1b15a482f69c18f71","tid":456158,"uid":36291,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-02T17:16:14.000Z","msg":"台灣?"},{"pid":"07dd4e70610b6d4884474bd6988c78adf50571c4","tid":456158,"uid":64181,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-02T17:29:17.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://img.eservice-hk.net/upload/2017/11/03/012912_863b13b414e24f52c2ec6d5e529ffdbf.jpeg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.eservice-hk.net%2Fupload%2F2017%2F11%2F03%2F012912_863b13b414e24f52c2ec6d5e529ffdbf.jpeg&h=a7360266&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"e92343cb5d08f4537db8c8ed9305d0a75d00edce","tid":456158,"uid":64181,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-02T17:30:37.000Z","msg":"今鋪真係唔洗玩。中國可以直接購買<br />\n<a href=\"https://lihkg.com/thread/456123/page/1?ref=ios\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lihkg.com/thread/456123/page/1?ref=ios</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"9d1b6af98ec6e1259e28ab6a7fef630942d4c713","tid":456158,"uid":294,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-02T20:26:37.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote>"}]}
