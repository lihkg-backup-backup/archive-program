For those who have given countless hours of their time, effort and resources, we thank you for your Contribution. From Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), and Pan-Dem, to students and citizens, we all stood together and fought against the tyranny. With our deepest regret, a precious life was sacrificed whom we mourn and will not forget.<br />\nHong Kong has finally been awakened, the citizens of Hong Kong now hold a united front against the tyranny. This is only the beginning, we are expected to achieve so much more. First, we demand the complete withdrawal of this deeply flawed extradition law. Secondly, we urge Carrie Lam to step down from her role immediately. Thirdly, protestors who were arrested should be released immediately and unconditionally. The 6.12 protest was not a riot, the government needs to acknowledge this. Finally, we must ensure the Hong Kong Police take responsibility for the excessive use of force and the abuse of power it employed during the protest, which has resulted in numerus injuries. <br />\nWe might hold different values, but at this time, we are united. We are united because of the ignorance of this government, the repeated use of force from the police, and the failure of the ombudsman to monitor the government . We are fed up, and we will no longer be ignored. This is our civic responsibility , we must stand together to defend our city&rsquo;s core values and protect our home.<br />\nWe might hold different values, but at this time, we are united.

Some of our comrades suggested the roadmap of confrontation should be: non-violent protest-&gt;determine the baseline-&gt;elevate the protest, and I deem this shrewd and efficient. I would like to expand the roadmap in order to come up with a more efficient and long-term plan, thus defending the future of Hong Kong and that of our next generations."},{"pid":"778703e72e2e95be6f93240b366f21f8740be808","tid":1253108,"uid":17429,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-23T11:35:13.000Z","msg":"白大<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e668ac05c57fd93c54d4caaf459d6e4b94fa7562","tid":1253108,"uid":136727,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-23T11:37:11.000Z","msg":"Summarizing this experience, I think the Hong Kong people's victory equation is as follows: Establish a single and effective target For example, the current police abuse of power abuse. Fully promote and gather strength It is necessary to get a lot of support and action base through a lot of publicity, unite everyone, analyze their interests, and discuss them rationally. Stay flexible and retarget The plan will never catch up with the changes. It is necessary to maintain flexibility and adjust the actions and goals in response to the response of the public and tyranny. Whether the current goal is successful or not, it is necessary to deploy the next goal and action at the same time, and step by step to fight against tyranny. As long as all Hong Kong people maintain unity and constantly set goals and strive for it, I believe that as long as they persist, they will gradually implement and protect Hong Kong's core values, safeguard Hong Kong's interests and development in the long run, and create a better environment for the next generation.<br />\n<br />\nAt the same time, I boldly put forward the following short, medium and long-term goals. I hope that everyone can rationally analyze and discuss, brainstorm and broaden, aim to maintain Hong Kong's unity and act to protect Hong Kong's future. short term: Release the arrested judges and promise never to pursue Government officials are responsible for stepping down Investigate the black police abuse Medium term: Reform the police force and set up an effective monitoring mechanism Reforming the political system and responding to the Legislative Council's monitoring function Involved in community work, acted to move the public and regain the parliament long: Reopening the political reform, reaching double suffrage, reflecting the public opinion through elections Formulate political party law, archival law, and referendum law to protect Hong Kong's major interests Discussing the 2047 limit and jointly ensuring Hong Kong's prosperity and stability in the long run In the end, I will emphasize it once again, but I will not seek for a success, but I will seek the commonweal of the people, protect my city, protect my family, fulfill Hong Kong civic responsibility, and unite to protect the future of Hong Kong's next generation.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\">請各位巴絲廣發去其他媒體，政黨，外國。<br />\n令全球廣知香港現今嘅處境和廣大市民嘅期望，多謝大家<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></span></span>"},{"pid":"09097f0b03c776a4b39326cd89b3728b6186b4b2","tid":1253108,"uid":57634,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-23T12:02:52.000Z","msg":"白大<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7e1a2b5c35dc8503d1445364014c89e262da812c","tid":1253108,"uid":136727,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-23T12:54:41.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"3ca398c627e7347424389ec56a78444942540485","tid":1253108,"uid":123615,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-23T17:25:14.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"70d84f73ec258bffcd090c855a28754eae1cc5d4","tid":1253108,"uid":264780,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T00:47:28.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/shocking.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n假如628各地報紙都見到公開信？<br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/daafJS\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/daafJS</a><br />\n<br />\n[行動] re: 假如628各地報紙都見到公開信？<br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1252646\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1252646</a>"},{"pid":"5c5f86e3e8fdccfcc2c4b2e05f7bd693a877abe5","tid":1253108,"uid":214672,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T00:50:48.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />白老大"},{"pid":"968cc7c100ab8d26c089a0b5edd85af4e19a961d","tid":1253108,"uid":197540,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T00:57:33.000Z","msg":"白大都要出聲<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4f0e75e5eeab3fc68a7badfcd931103210e02166","tid":1253108,"uid":212182,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T00:57:36.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"262529e59c7a6c89570c8d1ff9a31fb8da134ba9","tid":1253108,"uid":136727,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T03:32:39.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"da910971c12f0b958d4b5f8c63e06d11c743d0a3","tid":1253108,"uid":12180,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T03:37:44.000Z","msg":"PISH"},{"pid":"d9ca61d96df7aa5e8ecf80dd68a76cf47cdba137","tid":1253108,"uid":136727,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-24T13:01:27.000Z","msg":"pish"},{"pid":"43f8591f9c2b891c5a8f8c46ce50d0cf43872d1f","tid":1253108,"uid":136727,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-26T13:38:47.000Z","msg":"pish"}]}
