speeds of up to 29,000mph are being watched closely by NASA<br />\n<br />\nNASA has detected two asteroids which are headed towards Earth at speeds of up to 29,000mph.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to NASA&rsquo;s Centre for Near-Earth Object Studies, one of the approaching objects is an asteroid which will intersect Earth&rsquo;s path.<br />\n<br />\nThe first space rock is expected to visit our planet&rsquo;s path on Friday and is called 2020 GR2.<br />\n<br />\n2020 GR2 is currently travelling across space at a speed of almost 10,000mph and is believed to be 102ft tall.<br />\n<br />\nThe asteroid is an Apollo asteroid as it follows a wide orbit around the Sun.<br />\n<br />\nIt will not intersect Earth&rsquo;s orbit this time, but it does flies close to our planet during some visits.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to NASA, 2020 GR2 make its near-Earth approach on April 17 at 6.57pm BST.<br />\n<br />\nNASA tracking two giant asteroids travelling up to 29,000mph near Earth's orbit<br />\n<br />\nThe asteroid will be about 0.03188 astronomical units from the planet&rsquo;s centre, which is equivalent to almost 3 million miles away.<br />\n<br />\nIt is not expected to return to Earth&rsquo;s vicinity until February 21, 2080, after this pass.<br />\n<br />\nTrailing behind 2020 GR2 is an asteroid known as 2020 GT2, which is much larger and fast than 2020 GR2."},{"pid":"f48728bfd97b58d879ee98ea3e55d6ccba3b41f8","tid":1978256,"uid":222966,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-18T14:32:45.000Z","msg":"又黎啊？知啦知啦<img

science fiction fan. She said &quot;If starships would exist, I would quit my job and spend the rest of my life roaming the universe.&quot; By the end of the next century, scientists will have invented starships. As I'm extremely interested in the science of starships, I'm gonna ask physics professor Dr. Lau about it. I'm going to wait outside the lecture hall at quarter of seven. He'll have finished his lecture. I thought about phoning him at ten after three but my friend said &quot;Don't phone him now. He won't have finished his lecture yet.&quot; It's true that he wouldn't have finished teaching yet. Celine is a CFO at Hilton. If she takes the job at the Bank of China, she'll be five thousand five hundred dollars a month better off but she's still better off now than she was three years ago when she was working below everyone else in the department. She thinks a junior accountant position is beneath her. If she hadn't taken the CFA exam level three three years previously, she wouldn't be working as a CFO now. If she had pursued a career in sales instead of finance, her salary would be much lower. If it hadn't been for her auntie's referral to Hilton, her career wouldn't take off now and she wouldn't start earning a lot of money. Recently, her sister married her high school sweetheart. Her father felt sje was marrying beneath her though. Her uncle too feels her husband is beneath her. She enjoys socializing with the better off. Last month, Celine was away on a business trip to Hokkaido. After her trip, I said &quot;If you should travel to Hokkaido again, can you get me a pack of White Lover Cookies please?&quot; Celine is a computer expert. Her cousin has to write a report which is due on tuesday but he's having problems with his computer. If Celine would go and fix his computer, he'll be so thankful for her help. He also has exams next Monday so he's better off revising at home over the weekend. Celine is a kickboxing fan. Her favorite fighter Dan has recently won his retirement fight. He's deeply grateful to his coaches and thankful that he has got a job as a color commentator after he retired from the sport. All the fans wanna see Fred versus Randy. If Fred will sign a contract with the organization, Dana will make the fight happen. When Randy was reading the terms and conditions of the contract, Dana's assistant said &quot;If you would just sign here please.&quot; Celine's brother is a concierge in a hotel. I said &quot;If it'll make you happy, I'll come to stay for two nights as company for you while your colleagues are away.&quot;"}]}
