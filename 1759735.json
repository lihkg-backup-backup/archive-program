Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang summoned the U.S. ambassador, Terry Branstad, on Monday to express &ldquo;strong opposition&rdquo; to what the country&rsquo;s government considers American interference in the protests, including the legislation, according to statement.<br />\n<br />\nThe new U.S. law comes just as Washington and Beijing have shown signs of working toward what the White House calls a &ldquo;phase-one&rdquo; deal to ease the trade war. Trump would like the agreement finished in order to ease economic uncertainty for his re-election campaign in 2020, and has floated the possibility of signing the deal in a farm state as an acknowledgment of the constituency that&rsquo;s borne the brunt of retaliatory Chinese tariffs.<br />\nU.S. and Chinese trade negotiators will continue communicating closely and work toward a phase-one deal, Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said at a briefing in Beijing on Thursday.<br />\nBefore a&nbsp;speech&nbsp;at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Beijing last week, China&rsquo;s Vice Premier Liu He -- the country&rsquo;s chief trade negotiator -- said that he was &ldquo;cautiously optimistic&rdquo; about reaching the phase one accord, according to people who attended a dinner and asked not to be identified.<br />\n<br />\nPublished on&nbsp;2019年11月27日 下午1:03 [HAST]"},{"pid":"ab1610d2057c79b1bd3a27f40e97a3c290af9eca","tid":1759735,"uid":35221,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-27T23:28:20.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKalKs_WwAAElJK?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FEKalKs_WwAAElJK%3Fformat%3Djpg%26name%3Dlarge&h=04b79fee&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"bab1972f10bdefe8ced406af4e85d8239e387db2","tid":1759735,"uid":263150,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-11-27T23:29:19.000Z","msg":"確定係乜嘢版本未？"},{"pid":"cf3d66488b189d4d8ce804fc0077fa931357f20d","tid":1759735,"uid":155095,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-27T23:29:36.000Z","msg":"支持侵侵 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hk01.com/di/media/images/cis/5dd808cb5272b81167ca549f.jpg/OkcnpMzdu_lbZk_BEDBPs1YADpG0nt-OC51ccQudXHE\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.hk01.com%2Fdi%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2Fcis%2F5dd808cb5272b81167ca549f.jpg%2FOkcnpMzdu_lbZk_BEDBPs1YADpG0nt-OC51ccQudXHE&h=61f7700a&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"d8c3c0a5b3ca6d60ea1ead35e5895eef1e71e7ed","tid":1759735,"uid":61494,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"bab1972f10bdefe8ced406af4e85d8239e387db2","tid":1759735,"uid":263150,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-11-27T23:29:19.000Z","msg":"確定係乜嘢版本未？"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-27T23:30:34.000Z","msg":"得一個版本過晒兩院"},{"pid":"0b21247481186975d75460687f84a67f5cd8f5e6","tid":1759735,"uid":259813,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-27T23:31:16.000Z","msg":"今晚愛丁堡廣場見<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"61208a99e0daf034338dba80ee26af2283d9dc5e","tid":1759735,"uid":255976,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-27T23:33:04.000Z","msg":"整個禁止入境名單先啦，好多警謊架"},{"pid":"45722fe390e6e98bddcd95c8c54e026e21e2f27c","tid":1759735,"uid":213167,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-27T23:34:14.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/472340-trump-signs-bill-supporting-hong-kong-protesters-despite-chinese\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fadministration%2F472340-trump-signs-bill-supporting-hong-kong-protesters-despite-chinese&d=iBLSwy1tqwhlDNpwtuM9Da7XYz%2BrpCtmef%2B4BlhZTRs%3D&h=605b3325\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/472340-trump-signs-bill-supporting-hong-kong-protesters-despite-chinese</a><br />\n<br />\nNovember 27, 2019 - 06:12 PM EST<br />\n<br />\nTrump signs bill supporting Hong Kong protesters despite Chinese opposition<br />\n<br />\nPresident Trump&nbsp;on Wednesday signed legislation offering support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, one&nbsp;week after it passed the House and Senate with veto-proof majorities.<br />\nThe White House made the announcement that Trump had signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act despite protests from officials in Beijing, who complained that the legislation meddled in their domestic matters.<br />\n&quot;I signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China, and the people of Hong Kong,&quot;
