These proceedings arose from the 2019 District Council Ordinary Election for the Kowloon City District Council To Kwa Wan South Constituency (the &ldquo;Constituency&rdquo;) held on 24 November 2019 (the &ldquo;Election&rdquo;).  Lee Hin Long (&ldquo;R1&rdquo;) was the elected candidate.  Lam Pok (the &ldquo;Petitioner&rdquo;) was one of the unsuccessful candidates. <br />\n...<br />\n90. In the circumstances, I declare that R1 was not duly elected in the Election.  I cannot determine whether some other person was duly elected instead.  That is also not being sought in the Election Petition.  I declare instead that R1 ceases to be an elected member of the District Council, and that his office as the District Councillor of the Constituency is vacant.<br />\n<br />\n92. I make a costs order nisi that R1 shall bear the costs of both HCAL 247/2020 and HCMP 1183/2020"}]}
