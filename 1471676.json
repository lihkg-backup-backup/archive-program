I&rsquo;ll be flying to japan and seeing Toyama vs Sagamihara live on the thirty first of August. I&rsquo;m a fan of Mizuki Arai. He was a very exciting midfielder who was worth his weight in gold to Toyama. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong- I still enjoy watching him play even though his prime has passed. He proved his worth to Toyama by helping win multiple cups. His worth to the team was incalculable. I must say he&rsquo;s made significant progress with his shooting over the years. Unfortunately his leg injury has progressed fairly rapidly forcing him to be sidelined for three months through injury. His friend Kenji Dai will also be out of commission until his back heals. He&rsquo;s made slow but steady progress with his skills since he injured his back. His doctor👨🏻&zwj;⚕️said he was making good progress and will check on his progress next month. He assigned the blame for his injury to a lack of stretching🙆🏻&zwj;♂️and training. Oh well😔it could be worse. His worth to the team is incalculable. Toyama is as likely to win the Asian cup as Sendai in my opinion. The other month they didn&rsquo;t just beat Sagamihara. They wiped the floor with them. The responsibilities of every coach in every team are well defined. In addition, the government has established a commission to investigate the use of steroids among players. Another commission has also been appointed to examine family violence in Japanese football clubs which I wholeheartedly support. Besides football, I like boxing as well. Floyd will be fighting in Vegas next January. If he tests positive for performance enhancing drugs again the fans will be bitterly disappointed in him. The promoter will also be terribly disappointed with him since last year two of his tests came back positive. As a result he was suspended for half a year. However if he loses because of ring rust due to having been suspended for half a year, the fans including me will be disappointed by the result. My brother who&rsquo;s also a boxing fan will be deeply disappointed at the fact that he loses due to ring rust because of having been suspended. I was deeply disappointed to find his match with Shane was overturned to a no contest. The fans were terribly disappointed to hear he would be suspended too."}]}
