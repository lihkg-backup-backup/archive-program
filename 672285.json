/>\n中國國家主席習近平將解除針對中興的禁令列為與美國達成更廣泛貿易交易的一個條件。在美國商務部宣布禁止中興在未來7年從美國採購芯片和其它零部件後，該公司被迫停止運營。<br />\n<br />\n昨日，北京方面宣布從7月1日起將乘用車進口關稅從25%下調至15%，一些分析人士認為，這是特朗普在中興問題上的立場發生逆轉後，北京方面作出的讓步。<br />\n<br />\n自特朗普上周首次下令逆轉政策以來，魯比奧一直是共和黨內中興交易的主要反對者。他表示，將管理層變動、罰款和其他設想作為交易條件的想法不夠。<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\"><br />\n「令人遺憾的是，中國在與我國行政當局的談判中佔了上風，他們正在贏得目前的貿易談判，」魯比奧在Twitter上寫道。<br

Committee)昨日通過一項措施，使特朗普至少在一年內無法修改對中興的處罰。<br />\n</span><br />\n特朗普表示，他尚未就中興問題達成交易，並承認，他重新考慮對中興的處罰，只是因為習近平向他提出了這一要求。美國官員把習近平就中興問題提出的干預請求，比作特朗普代表美國企業向外國領導人提出的請求。<br />\n<br

All major American law enforcement, intelligence and counterintelligence agencies agree with this. Nor is there any doubt that Russia has targeted the 2018 midterm elections and that this attack is underway today.<br />\n<br />\nADVERTISEMENT<br />\nSimilarly, there is no doubt that Robert Mueller is an intensely patriotic American and long-term Republican &mdash; along with other intensely patriotic Americans and Republicans such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray."},{"pid":"0fde78807efb25b58b17bacfcc507b2b95e30339","tid":672285,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-30T12:43:28.000Z","msg":"When Rubio, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, defends Mueller and defends the integrity and fairness of the Mueller investigation, and calls for Mueller and the investigation to be protected until all evidence is fairly gathered and fully evaluated, he is performing an invaluable service to America and, I would argue, to Republicans as well as Democrats.<br />\n<br />\nRegarding North Korea, all patriotic and sane Americans hope the negotiations succeed. But there is real danger in talks that are not well managed and prepared. There is no urgency that talks begin on June 12. There is real doubt that North Korea will agree to complete denuclearization. There is real urgency that an agreement is reached that will probably operate in stages but in any event, must  include aggressive on-site verification by American-approved inspectors and experts.<br />\n<br />\nADVERTISEMENT<br />\nRubio is right in warning that our negotiating position must be well-prepared, carefully thought out, and effectively include airtight protections against a North Korean nuclear danger. Rubio is also right in warning about the threat from China and the need to refuse concessions that benefit ZTE, which has violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran, lied about those violations and uses its products to commit espionage against America.<br />\n<br />\nThe Mueller investigation, Korea negotiations and U.S.-China relations are complicated and volatile, central to American security and fast-moving. They could move in directions Rubio will support, but could also move in directions that require Rubio to take game-changing, profile-in-courage stands against actions that Trump might take that require Republicans to take hard positions of high principle.<br />\n<br />\nHistory teaches that great crises create great leaders with lasting impact.

They kill us on other things. ... [T]hey kill us with NATO. They kill us.&quot;<br />\nHe sees both as examples of international systems set up to screw the U.S. And now he&rsquo;s going around the world with his hand out, collecting what he sees are America&rsquo;s dues.<br />\nWhy it matters: When the history of the Trump presidency is written, one of the most important chapters will be the way he changed America&rsquo;s relationship with Europe.<br />\n<br />\nHe doesn&rsquo;t do what normal U.S. presidents do and make unequivocal statements about solidarity against shared threats. He asks them to pay up.<br />\nRhetorically at least, he seldom distinguishes between allies and adversaries. And when he does, he often saves the toughest words for America&rsquo;s allies.<br />\nTrump&rsquo;s theory of the case is that Europe needs us more than we need them. And certainly for now, at least, Europeans have nowhere else to turn for their protection.<br />\nIt&rsquo;s possible his theory works out in the long term and they become militarily much more self-sufficient. But what&rsquo;s not clear is what it will mean for the U.S. in the long run to draw down so much goodwill with our traditional allies.<br />\nEuropean officials have been telling us they&rsquo;re worried Trump will take a &quot;purely transactional&quot; approach to NATO and ignore shared values and the other dimensions of the alliance.<br />\nReality check: Trump is correct that the other NATO members aren&rsquo;t living up to their financial commitments. But they have been improving over the past two years.<br />\n<br />\nWhat's next: The other NATO member states worry &mdash; and the rally seems to confirm their fears &mdash; that Trump will come into next week's NATO summit in Brussels like a wrecking ball, and beat up on them over not paying their bills.<br />\n<br />\nThe path they would prefer: a victory lap for the progress made since he became president. <br />\nThe Germans are especially concerned, but it&rsquo;s not just them. There are so many other countries who live in real fear of Russia and know that Vladimir Putin is rooting for transatlantic tensions and divisions. <br />\nThe Europeans' worst fear of all &mdash; so bad it&rsquo;s almost unthinkable &mdash; would be for Trump to say at the summit that U.S. protection is somehow conditional on them meeting defense spending targets.<br />\nTrump&rsquo;s aides assure the allies he will provide an &ldquo;ironclad&rdquo; commitment to continue defending them, and certainly he&rsquo;s done so a number of times over the past year.<br />\nBe smart: European officials tell us they&rsquo;re still nervous because they don&rsquo;t trust that Trump&rsquo;s advisers actually speak for Trump."},{"pid":"990ba15428736315ff36d5003ce5cc1a9b3046cf","tid":672285,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-18T00:23:02.000Z","msg":"Marco Rubio<br />\n<br />\n@marcorubio<br />\n<br />\n&middot;<br />\n<br />\n12h<br />\n<br />\n#Helsinki &amp; subsequent reaction showed #Putin achieved goals of interference: 1.

Chris Van Hollen of Maryland comes a day after Trump and Putin met privately for two hours and the president said he believes Putin instead of U.S. intelligence over the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The joint press conference sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from Democrats and Republicans, though Trump tried to walk back his comments on Tuesday by saying he misspoke.<br />\n<br />\nRubio and Van Hollen&rsquo;s bill, called the Defending Elections from Threats by Establishing Redlines (DETER) Act, is the first bill since the 2016 presidential election that sets specific punishments for the Russian government and other countries that interfere in U.S. political campaigns.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Congress has already taken various steps when it comes to Russia and its interference in 2016, this will just be one moving forward that hopefully would deter future attacks, which I believe is the real threat here ultimately,&rdquo; Rubio said on Tuesday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what happened, but what could happen in the future. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll get to a critical mass and momentum that we can get going on it and get it passed.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nRubio&rsquo;s bill, if passed, codifies specific penalties for the Russians that must be implemented within 10 days if the Director of National Intelligence determines that interference took place.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe penalties include &ldquo;sanctions on major sectors of the Russian economy, including finance, energy, defense, and metals and mining&rdquo; and blacklisting every senior Russian political figure or oligarch identified in the Russian sanctions bill that became law in 2017 over the initial objections of Trump after a supermajority in Congress approved it.<br />\n<br />\nThe bill lays out specific acts by foreign governments that constitute election interference. Foreign governments are forbidden from purchasing advertisements to influence elections, using social and traditional media to spread &ldquo;significant amounts&rdquo; of false information, hacking election or campaign infrastructure such as voter registration databases and campaign emails, and blocking access to elections infrastructure such as websites that provide information on polling locations."},{"pid":"0eed93b28927ab7d88f2435117a6901596481fb4","tid":672285,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-19T03:05:44.000Z","msg":"Last week, deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein indicted 12 Russian nationals who allegedly stole emails and documents from the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
