Three of Hong Kong&rsquo;s most senior judges told Reuters that the independent judiciary, the cornerstone of the city&rsquo;s broad freedoms, is in a fight for its survival.<br />\n<br />\nBeijing&rsquo;s effort to hobble the judiciary is multi-pronged, according to more than two dozen interviews with judges, leading lawyers and diplomats in Hong Kong. The state-controlled press on the mainland has warned Hong Kong judges not to &ldquo;absolve&rdquo; protesters arrested during last year&rsquo;s demonstrations. Judges and lawyers say there are signs Beijing is trying to limit the authority of Hong Kong courts to rule on core constitutional matters. And people close to the city&rsquo;s top judge, Geoffrey Ma, say he has to contend with Communist Party officials pushing Beijing&rsquo;s view that the rule of law ultimately must be a tool to preserve one-party rule."},{"pid":"14904d061ae2f937dc5a3d2716e17512c9e9437b","tid":1972297,"uid":129202,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-14T12:22:55.000Z","msg":"有咩辦法頂住？"},{"pid":"01adcd76080005dc4659828f1cde8768725ec705","tid":1972297,"uid":93986,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-04-14T12:24:44.000Z","msg":"繼續有險可守<br />\n到而家都未死"},{"pid":"8bfccadc60cd000ef69725559035622d8460665f","tid":1972297,"uid":41404,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-14T12:25:12.000Z","msg":"That tension flared into view last September when Ma spoke at the International Bar Association conference in Seoul about the rule of law, including the extensive human rights protections built into Hong Kong&rsquo;s legal system.
