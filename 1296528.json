I've been to many countries. I'd always thought that many other countries were better than hong kong but after I went to many countries on vacation I realised that in terms of city life, nightlife, food and shopping hong kong really is the best. In europe shops close at four to five on weekdays and don't open at all at weekends except for big cities like london where shops close at six on weekdays and four at weekends. Their main sites of entertainment are.pubs and clubs. Las vegas has magnificent night views but it was primarily built for tourism. It's famous for gambling, unique hotel design and shows like boxing events. However in terms of scenery Scandinavia and Tibet are the most ravishing I would say.Tibet is famous for its breathtaking scenery at high altitude. Xinjiang is also a place of outstanding scenic beauty. If you might have altitude sickness such as dizziness, headaches and trouble sleeping I suggest that you bring some medicine along with you. My friend who's been to Mount Everest base camp showed me his photos taken there by which I was awestruck. It's definitely a glamorous holiday destination. A tour of the base camp would be a once in a lifetime experience. Tibet is also the best place for stargazing as it's much closer to the heavens than any other places on earth and the sky at night is often clear and cloudless.It has some of the highest lakes in the world that are rich with fish and other marine life and the countryside is inhabited by flocks of yellow ducks as well as wild horses and donkeys. The lakes there such as Lake Paiku which is four thousand five hundred and ninety two metres above sea level reflect the beauty of the stars giving a double view of the sky at night. You can even set up camp there to get the best view of the stars and the milky way galaxy.My friend Joe isn't very well-to-do whereas his girlfriend's family is very well-off. Last week he threw a party at his place where cheap wines were served. The sofas in his apartment are made of some cheap material. His television is cheap and nasty. Recently he bought some clothes on the cheap from a shop that is facing possible liquidation.He bought a pair of cheap trainers that fell apart after a few months so I thought him a pair of good quality sneakers. He's too mean to buy new shoes.He's very cheap with the air conditioner too- it's only on for an hour each day then he turns on the fans and opens the windows instead but the air conditioner was dirt cheap. He vacationed in Macau the other week but he's so cheap he didn't even buy is postcards.He stayed in a three star hotel where it serves cheap and cheerful food and sells cheap and cheerful clothes.He's an euphonium teacher. He explained to us regarding a piece by clementi &quot;this passage should be played beautifully rather than rhythmically. Otherwise it's a bit cheap.&quot; I saw lots of his pencil marks on the score such as: cantabile, silence, no pause here, just separate, clean pedal, more melodic voicing, remain soft, quiet, hear tenor, clearer, articulate, in time, silvery soft, gentler, take time....Regardijg teaching he said &quot;I prefer payment in blocks. My students pay monthly or for four lessons at a time.For this month you can pay on a lesson-by-lesson basis because maybe you wanna see what it's like to have lessons.From next month onwards pay monthly. Students of all standards are welcome.I'm also an accompanist who accompanies instrumentalists, singers and other performers for exams, auditions and live performances.&quot; He asked me to get him some Haydn scores as I can get them on the cheap from a friend of mine.We watched a boxing fight in which Paul hit chris with a cheap shot after he lost to chris. We watched a comedy show as well which was full of cheap laughs.The comedian is famous for his vulgar manner and wearing a vulgar suit.His grandfather was a cheap gangster and liar.His jokes and jibes were cheap and vulgar."}]}
