In NYT news articles, they call everyone Mr., Ms or Mrs., including mass murderers. If you have a chance to meet with Carrie Lam, if you speak respectfully and calmly, at least she'll hear what you say (it probably won't change her mind), but if you scream and curse at her, she will just harden her position. The key thing is that personal feelings are less important than what's best for the movement. If you're sure you can crush the other side, you can act as rudely and aggressively as you like. But if the other side is so much more powerful, the only way to get some of what you want is through peaceful means (peaceful protests, negotiations, bringing public opinion to your side). For example, Martin Luther King had meetings with government officials (including President Johnson), whom he probably hated, while protesting their policies. You might hate the people of the other side, but having dialogs with them (in addition to other actions such as voting) might be in the best interest of the movement. <br />\nAnother nitpick: I would also sign the ad with &quot;The People of Hong Kong&quot; (or Hongkong) instead of &quot;Hongkongers.&quot; If Americans were writing such a letter, they would sign it with &quot;The People of America&quot; and not &quot;Americans.&quot; It sounds better."},{"pid":"abdcb4a25c45d219fc8a6e6618e3bf5976580b2f","tid":1263065,"uid":134839,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-28T03:45:40.000Z","msg":"The protesters throwing eggs or pointing laser at the police are too young to think strategically.
