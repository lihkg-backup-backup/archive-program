Executive producers Sean Daniel and Jason Brown (The Expanse), said: &ldquo;The Witcher stories follow an unconventional family that comes together to fight for truth in a dangerous world. The characters are original, funny and constantly surprising and we can&rsquo;t wait to bring them to life at Netflix, the perfect home for innovative storytelling.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nPlatige Image, a Polish production and visual effects house will co-produce. Executive producers Baginski and Jarek Sawko emphasised that the books' subtexts will not be lost in the adaptation: &quot;There is a moral and intellectual depth in these books which goes beyond genre. It is a story about today and today&rsquo;s challenges, hidden under a fantasy cover. It is a story about us, about the monster and the hero inside all of our hearts.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nNo release date, casting, or further directorial choices have been revealed at time of writing.<br />\n<a href=\"http://au.ign.com/articles/2017/05/17/netflix-to-produce-the-witcher-tv-series\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fau.ign.com%2Farticles%2F2017%2F05%2F17%2Fnetflix-to-produce-the-witcher-tv-series&d=6VUJY1vbA2ifZxBcTMZdI5UWI6eGpREPWAa3TRi9Bo4%3D&h=5687f7ec\" target=\"_blank\">http://au.ign.com/articles/2017/05/17/netflix-to-produce-the-witcher-tv-series</a>"},{"pid":"59b038a5e3280acac50adfbdef0ab21739220654","tid":247026,"uid":28858,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-05-17T13:12:41.000Z","msg":"個作者日日講冇係隻game度賺錢真係好煩<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"bd1503376315a480c80c18f5152a8b8b8ccbf4ce","tid":247026,"uid":18241,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-05-17T14:56:48.000Z","msg":"先不說這些, 來一盤昆特吧!"},{"pid":"755bf60bc1153564d3214252eae1345243268bcd","tid":247026,"uid":555,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-05-17T15:00:22.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/tongue.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
