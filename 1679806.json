Everyone loves this city dearly, yet I recognise that there are strongly diverse views on its development and future.  <br />\n<br />\nI reiterate that I am against any form of violence by any party. <strong>We urgently need exchange of views in a peaceful and rational manner and HKU must be able to serve this purpose.</strong>  Most important of all, I care about the safety and well-being of our students and it is our moral obligation and pastoral care role to understand and help them.  <br />\n<br />\nThe SMT and I have been meeting with students involved in the unrest, and in some cases we have contacted their families, to attend to their needs and concerns. The Student Support Team that I established in July and CEDARS provide urgent support, ensuring students have access to legal advice, counselling and other necessary services. Our Faculty Deans, Hall Wardens, College Masters and teachers have also reached out to students and stayed engaged with them. <br />\n<br />\nFurthermore, we have explained to the campus community our principles and practice regarding police entry onto University property. (link) <br />\n<br />\nThe SMT and I believe that ongoing engagement with students is very important.  We have held discussions with students at various occasions in different manners and will continue to do so.   <br />\n<br />\nProfessor Xiang Zhang<br />\nPresident and Vice-Chancellor<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n吖 Xiang Zhang，其實你瞓醒未 <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/sick.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"012acc417439946f8cfd560304713df6c3fe5ae6","tid":1679806,"uid":47605,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-28T11:49:48.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><img src=\"https://na.cx/i/qXEs9qi.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FqXEs9qi.jpg&h=02cd3311&s={SIZE}\" /></blockquote>"},{"pid":"e46bd4476b689bd22763be575f9eb8e13d0f3c9d","tid":1679806,"uid":156096,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-28T11:50:06.000Z","msg":"唔好意思，推post &amp; 借個靚位<br />\n<br />\n鐘庭耀教授為今次運動發起了超大型全港民調，追蹤長期民意，做份國際文宣，話比全世界聽， 5毛網軍不代表香港人<br />\n<br />\n連登post: 鍾庭耀教授都企左出來....你仲做冷氣軍師??<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1675545\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1675545</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<br />\n眾籌link: <a href=\"https://www.collaction.hk/project/story/1209/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.collaction.hk%2Fproject%2Fstory%2F1209%2F&d=wmdQs5dGAEixecl6soOD51yVYJ%2BaYT2AGLfERhQaW2c%3D&h=eac48408\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.collaction.hk/project/story/1209/</a>"},{"pid":"bd3a907cfaed8e4502078c93ea4a282bbb5c0140","tid":1679806,"uid":267212,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-28T11:52:18.000Z","msg":"仲discuss<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"bb1c4108141666ec938714e95ce199ba08f643f0","tid":1679806,"uid":101307,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-28T11:57:32.000Z","msg":"以為佢死左渣 咁耐都冇回音<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/z.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
