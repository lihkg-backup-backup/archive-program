Police have authorised another protest march to take place on Sunday 7 July, starting in Salisbury Garden in Tsim Sha Tsui (Hong Kong harbour front) and the High Speed Rail terminus in West Kowloon. Violent clashes have also taken place between police and protesters. Further demonstrations remain likely, particularly around government buildings and may take place with little or no notice. Large sections of the city may be closed off and public transport affected. The situation remains unpredictable, so you should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments. If you&rsquo;re in and around areas where demonstrations are taking place, you should follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place if there are signs of disorder."},{"pid":"45f4cb8762f9466fd33f527ea5d2d06adc43cd52","tid":1288087,"uid":5195,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:05:23.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"fec8e142982ba96e7cef3948dbd97f519724691a","tid":1288087,"uid":108016,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:06:03.000Z","msg":"搞大佢！"},{"pid":"362eafc210acb025654482b2c977bb36cc8af29c","tid":1288087,"uid":126046,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:07:01.000Z","msg":"認真<br />\n仲乜忽然個個咁緊張<br />\n係咪有鬼攪事"},{"pid":"0c3c690313d72a33b7760526d4f62278cebcf259","tid":1288087,"uid":74778,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:07:29.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/oONJZYL.gif\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FoONJZYL.gif&h=9f98595a&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"6c319818e69aac846a438af9640484430d7a1136","tid":1288087,"uid":5523,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"0c3c690313d72a33b7760526d4f62278cebcf259","tid":1288087,"uid":74778,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:07:29.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/oONJZYL.gif\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FoONJZYL.gif&h=9f98595a&s={SIZE}\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:41:42.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/chicken.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b146d8114c2409554a4ea279de3ec9017ff4dd31","tid":1288087,"uid":60665,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:43:45.000Z","msg":"Violent clashes have also taken place between police and protesters"},{"pid":"06d57f7dd01b4800e43ab6a315716aa29c2bc9d9","tid":1288087,"uid":57460,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:51:47.000Z","msg":"學術題，&rdquo;between police and protesters&rdquo;當中 police行先有冇咩含意？"},{"pid":"b1f8ab4546b2bfdeabc72ed690f2ab1ed5184abc","tid":1288087,"uid":269578,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"362eafc210acb025654482b2c977bb36cc8af29c","tid":1288087,"uid":126046,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:07:01.000Z","msg":"認真<br />\n仲乜忽然個個咁緊張<br />\n係咪有鬼攪事"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:55:39.000Z","msg":"咁我都認真答, 呢d係通知 唔係警告, 唔係係都9出 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"89eb804091a4bd32df2decae00a74bf3e893e8aa","tid":1288087,"uid":16193,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"b1f8ab4546b2bfdeabc72ed690f2ab1ed5184abc","tid":1288087,"uid":269578,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"362eafc210acb025654482b2c977bb36cc8af29c","tid":1288087,"uid":126046,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:07:01.000Z","msg":"認真<br />\n仲乜忽然個個咁緊張<br />\n係咪有鬼攪事"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:55:39.000Z","msg":"咁我都認真答, 呢d係通知 唔係警告, 唔係係都9出 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:58:24.000Z","msg":"掉番轉626都無人諗到本來去禮賓府結果變左去警察總部啦！"},{"pid":"d1033fcde7dc7772b18068c5d9119949e5ed88f5","tid":1288087,"uid":55770,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"06d57f7dd01b4800e43ab6a315716aa29c2bc9d9","tid":1288087,"uid":57460,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T13:51:47.000Z","msg":"學術題，&rdquo;between police and protesters&rdquo;當中 police行先有冇咩含意？"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T14:02:25.000Z","msg":"Mary and I???<br />\nother groups of people and us????"}]}
