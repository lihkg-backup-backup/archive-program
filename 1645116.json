Despite hard video evidence and compelling witness accounts, the police have not been held accountable for their crimes. Among the most heinous of these human rights transgressions, often overlooked by observers, is their consistent and overt <span style=\"color: gold;\"><strong>use of sexual violence</strong></span> as a tool of oppression.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Arrested Protestors Routinely Subjected to Sexual Violence</strong><br />\nIn the first few months of the protest movement in Hong Kong, there had already been many accounts of <strong><span style=\"color: gold;\">female protestors being strip-searched</span></strong> in the presence of male police officers after they had been arrested. Victims described <strong><span style=\"color: gold;\">male policemen jeering and commenting on their sexual organs</span></strong>, while female officers looked on in quiet support. Male police officers have been captured on video manhandling female protestors and assaulting them in the breasts and genital areas. Confronted with these claims, the police force strenuously denied any wrongdoing and claimed that there was a conspiracy against them. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>Indecent Assault During Frisk and Wall Search</strong><br />\nWithout any checks on their power, police officers have become even more shameless in their use of sexual violence. Last week, when police officers stopped double-decker buses at bus stops for random searches, <span style=\"color: gold;\"><strong>several women were forced to strip to their underwear in public</strong></span>, purportedly to show that they were not carrying any weapons. Many have also lodged formal complaints about having their underwear dislodged and their private parts exposed while being frisked. A majority of these young women had been searched at whim, and were not even under custody. The problem of the police&rsquo;s sexual violence potentially extends to every single woman in Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Gang Rape in San Uk Ling Detention Centre </strong><br />\nThe notorious San Uk Ling Detention Centre, near the Hong Kong border with mainland China, is the crime scene of some of the most horrifying acts of sexual violence in the past few months. In a detention centre where no CCTV monitoring is available, female protestors were strip-searched in pitch-dark cells, and many were even <strong><span style=\"color: gold;\">gang raped by police officers</span></strong>. Their male companions were forced to watch before being beaten and tortured themselves.  Female detainees were not the only victims: <strong><span style=\"color: gold;\">male detainees were also subject to repeated anal rape by police officers</span></strong>. Calls for an independent investigation were firmly rebuffed. No one, including legislators and lawyers, were allowed into the detention centre, leaving victims with little recourse to justice."},{"pid":"f13d0697c0f00be4b0afa2a8b570409e097a7886","tid":1645116,"uid":151057,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-10T18:49:50.000Z","msg":"<strong>A Culture of Sexual Violence in the Police and Government</strong><br />\nThere is a culture of sexual violence and male chauvinism in the Hong Kong police. Frontline officers have been caught on video making casual remarks about raping female protestors, justifying their use of sexual violence. Their superiors have <strong><span style=\"color: gold;\">refused to condemn</span></strong> the sexual violence perpetrated by frontline officers, laying the <span style=\"color: gold;\"><strong>blame solely on the victims</strong></span>. Female politicians within the government are equally wiling to embrace patriarchal norms and weaponize sex: as an example, <strong><ins>Executive Committee member Fanny Law <strong><span style=\"color: gold;\">falsely accused</span></strong> female protestors of offering free sex to male protestors, describing them as &ldquo;comfort women&rdquo;. </ins></strong><br />\n<br />\nOn 10 October, <ins><strong><span style=\"color: gold;\"> a brave survivor of sexual violence from San Uk Ling spoke up in a forum with the Vice-Chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, describing the horrors in San Uk Ling in detail </span></strong></ins>and appealing to the school for support. Her efforts and bravery were in vain, as her Vice-Chancellor refused to formally condemn the police&rsquo;s use of sexual violence despite hearing her firsthand account. A white terror has now spread over Hong Kong where victims face humiliation and even punishment for daring to speak out against police violence. Physical and sexual violence have not just been tolerated, but even encouraged and rewarded by the authorities. A revolution of our times is needed to overthrow the twisted norms and moral bankruptcy that defines the Hong Kong government and the police force. <span style=\"color: red;\"><ins>We owe it to all the victims of sexual violence to continue our fight for justice to be done.</ins></span><br />\n<br />\nBy<strong><span style=\"color: gold;\"> Hong Kong Civil News Society (HKCNS)</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n===<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><em>我哋係抗爭者自發組織亦非大台<br />\nWe are an Independent civilian organisation,<br />\npledged to be the voice of Hong Kong's oppressed.<br />\n成立新聞社是為了抗衡政府及警察嘅抺黑<br />\n<span style=\"color: gold;\"><strong>HKCNS</strong></span> provides the counterbalance of smear tactics from the HKSAR government and its Police Forces,<br />\n將真正抗爭情況告知世界<br />\nRevealing to the world the truth of our cause.</em></span><br />\n===<br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">寫手不足﹑<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span style=\"color: gold;\">招募</span></span>！求義士協助﹑編纂高質新聞稿｜限時有效｜</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://t.me/joinchat/JABufk663yTdXdU7ErWQhQ\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fjoinchat%2FJABufk663yTdXdU7ErWQhQ&d=tgdX0zC4r3YoKKw%2Bq%2FbDqU63eTsi4ka8iUmrXsVTuNg%3D&h=cfd0a02f\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://t.me/joinchat/JABufk663yTdXdU7ErWQhQ</a>"},{"pid":"a3b80b995467bd7a852c7aff5cdf004c31897227","tid":1645116,"uid":151057,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-10T18:52:25.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong>Please share and tweet!!!</strong></span>"},{"pid":"0f86d878243c55cee82afdb4048b5f378dbf1ac9","tid":1645116,"uid":332832,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-10T19:00:55.000Z","msg":"Disgusting.
