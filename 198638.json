Tong and Senior Captain Fang Yuxin, deputy chief of staff of the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Ship visits are a critically important element for building trust, understanding and mutual cooperation between the United States and Hong Kong,&quot; said Tong. &quot;Being able to visit Hong Kong as a port call is a tradition that we cherish. The Sailors were able to enjoy the world-class hospitality of the citizens of Hong Kong and take in some of the culture.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe reception included food and refreshments prepared by the ship's supply department, a ceremonial cake cutting, and the opportunity for guests to admire the view of Hong Kong's skyline from the ship's flight deck.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I can't begin to express my gratitude to our guests for attending the reception here tonight,&quot; said Makin Island's Commanding Officer Capt.
