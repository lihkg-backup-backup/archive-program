For example, Samantha has bloomed into an utterly beautiful woman. Not every man's type of women are the same. Of course, everyone likes handsome and beautiful people. In terms of appearance, some men like petite women, some men like sporty women, some like them tall and thin, some like them svelte, some like them well-rounded and curvaceous, some like them voluptuous, some like them well-rounded, curvaceous and sporty, some like them busty, some like wide hips, some like curvy legs, some like silky feet and so on. In terms of personality, some men like kind-hearted and helpful women, some like Vivacious women, some like them compassionate, some like them quiet, some like them sociable and talkative, some like them tactful and diplomatic, some like to be controlled and dominated and so forth. Jeremy is a fan of Tracy Zhu and Samantha Gao who are exquisitely beautiful women. Like Jeremy, both of them have an exquisite taste in fashion, food, shoes, hairstyles, interior and exterior design. Both are glamorous women who always dress up in glamorous outfits. They rare dress down. I once saw Samantha dress up in a kimono for a party while Tracy was in a superman costume. Both of them have a glamorous job and career. I consider acting to be a worthwhile  career. Samantha has got a leading role in the upcoming television series whereas Tracy has got a supporting role in it. She plays the role of a lawyer in it. By the way, I don't think Jeremy needs to dress up to go to work. A pilot shirt and shorts are fine. Just dress down to go to work. He thinks that if a woman without makeup still looks pretty, then she's pretty.

I went bungee jumping twice in Macau. The top of Macau Tower is the highest place in Macau. This tower is taller than any buildings in Macau. Immediately before I jumped, I was nervous and a little frightened. All the buildings and hotels including The Parisian Macao looked so short. When I was falling, it was surreal and absolutely exhilarating. Do you like roller coasters? The most exciting roller coasters are in Fuji-Q Highland in Tokyo. Three of its roller coasters broke the Guinness World Records. The feelings before I did a bungee jump were different than those before I went on the roller coasters in Tokyo. Right before I rode those roller coasters, I was absolutely exhilarated whereas right before I made my bungee jump, I felt nervous and a little scared but of course, bungee jumping was a thrilling experience. Some people are crazy about bungee jumping, whether they bungee-jump from a tower or out if a helicopter. I'd love to go skydiving one day.

A dog barking, a fire engine siren wailing, an ambulance siren wailing, an airplane roaring overhead, a child shouting and a lightning storm can frighten rabbits. Therefore, walking a rabbit on a leash isn't recommended. Indoor rabbits have a much longer lifespan than outdoor rabbits because they're protected from poor weather conditions and enemies. They feel safe, protected, monitored, sheltered and that they're part of the family! The average lifespan of an indoor house rabbit is eight to fourteen years whereas that of a rabbit kept in an outdoor hutch or cage is three to six years. The happiest rabbit expression is called binky. When a rabbit binkies, it jumps into the air and twists its head and body in the opposite direction before falling back to the ground. A happy bunny even twirls, flops, shakes its head and stretches its legs. All these are telling you that it's happy and overall pleased with you and its life. Rabbits produce two types of droppings: fecal pellets and cecal pellets (aka cecotropes). The former are the dry, round ones you usually see in the litterbox while the latter are edible for rabbits which contain essential nutrients. Rabbits are one of the most abandoned pets in the world. In fact, it's the third most abandoned pets in the United States because people don't understand rabbits and think that they're boring and that they don't bond with humans. Rabbits are highly intelligent, social and affectionate animals. While they don't like to be picked up from the ground, they much prefer to be petted and cuddled while they're on the ground or in your lap. When people say they wanna have a pet rabbit, I usually advise them to visit the rabbit society and choose a rabbit for adoption."},{"pid":"96bd96ba54b5bcd8104209a0d93e94b8ab9da14c","tid":2283356,"uid":27210,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-06T15:25:06.000Z","msg":"叫你老細你估你真係老細咩"},{"pid":"686896ef0b1f161544ed2fcf67ccca68ef667bdc","tid":2283356,"uid":44007,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-06T18:09:07.000Z","msg":"我present緊件事咪撚cut鳩我講野<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/fuck.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n唔係樣樣野魔術咁變出黎"},{"pid":"c9a959db21412348fcb110b3455731857cad9587","tid":2283356,"uid":287099,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-06T18:52:41.000Z","msg":"你食屎啦老細"},{"pid":"7d0836c1a231fa7e9b64914c6da87f48dd132d9b","tid":2283356,"uid":4564,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-06T18:59:38.000Z","msg":"好多謝你畀咗好多機會我，悉心裁培之餘有咩鑊都幫手頂、一齊拆。有時做錯嘢自己都覺得自責同唔好意思嘅時候，你反而連鬧都冇鬧一句，只係話下次小心啲唔好再錯。做嘢又一齊做唔會扔低比我自己做，識得體恤下屬，齊上齊落<br />\n<br />\n好想跟你一世<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"cca22ebfcf164f301721a0c644bc0478cd5df18d","tid":2283356,"uid":55011,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-06T19:00:16.000Z","msg":"你唔洗返工我都會照同老細講你返足工㗎啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b1381dc547b8e686f61bf322281e058f8113ced5","tid":2283356,"uid":212878,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"7d0836c1a231fa7e9b64914c6da87f48dd132d9b","tid":2283356,"uid":4564,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-12-06T18:59:38.000Z","msg":"好多謝你畀咗好多機會我，悉心裁培之餘有咩鑊都幫手頂、一齊拆。有時做錯嘢自己都覺得自責同唔好意思嘅時候，你反而連鬧都冇鬧一句，只係話下次小心啲唔好再錯。做嘢又一齊做唔會扔低比我自己做，識得體恤下屬，齊上齊落<br />\n<br />\n好想跟你一世<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-07T09:48:58.000Z","msg":"咁撚好既上司邊度揾<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"98fb3c037586ecaad9c0357ba6e6e3bb61e1a04c","tid":2283356,"uid":83095,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-08T07:12:37.000Z","msg":"屌你老母臭西你做撚埋我果份"},{"pid":"8c8d79391fc925f6a864f6da84e07b064008102d","tid":2283356,"uid":114148,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-08T07:20:08.000Z","msg":"唔好啦"},{"pid":"ff259ea7f6b11f0e9c71d399ab8108a93f733a90","tid":2283356,"uid":30907,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-08T07:51:07.000Z","msg":"教我多啲design 我唔怕辛苦呀"},{"pid":"407da11f9d28ae5aa23b21c901aaf0eb70e23436","tid":2283356,"uid":39188,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-08T08:50:32.000Z","msg":"屌你老母 真係跟撚錯你"},{"pid":"2c90e957431e2294c3452c6a09e01d01c2eb4800","tid":2283356,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-08T10:47:42.000Z","msg":"I graduated with a master's degree in puccolo performance from a music conservatory in Vienna.
