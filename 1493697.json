At a special meeting on 8 August, the President and senior management agreed unanimously that the University had conveyed its stance unequivocally to students, and that an open dialogue with SU could hardly be advantageous to the recent problems in society. Such a forum would not provide new arguments for discussion. On the contrary, it may trigger more serious conflicts among our family of alumni, staff and students of different ideologies and backgrounds.<br />\n <br />\nStudent safety is our top priority. We have been very concerned about escalating public sentiment since 11 August, and as a result we have established the Emergency Response Unit (ERU). Since its establishment, ERU has conscientiously performed its duties and issued several UAs. In fact, Professor Horace Ip Ho-shing, Vice-President (Student Affairs), and Mr Sunny Lee Wai-kwong, Vice-President (Administration), had invited CityU students to an open meeting to discuss contingency plans for emergencies on 14 or 15 August.<br />\n <br />\nOn 15 August, 20 faculty members and members of CityU&rsquo;s leadership teams, including those who take care of alumni relations, issued a UA stating that now is not the time for an open meeting.
