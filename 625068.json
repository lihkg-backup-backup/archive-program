It has been suggested that graduates who fail to find a job in Hk could look for opportunities in other cities in Asia. Do u support this suggestion?<br />\nWrite an article for your school magazine expressing your views. Give three reasons to support your views. Provide an appropriate title for your magazine.<br />\n<br />\nWorking overseas:<br />\nTo be or Not to be?<br />\nRecently, there has been a heated controversy about whether the graduates who fail to find a job in Hong Kong to look for opportunities in other countries in Asia. I think that the suggestion is unrealistic. In this article, i will delve into the suggestion in the following.<br />\n<br />\nFirst of all, working overseas exists the problem of recognition.  As we all know,many graduates studied some special subjects, such as engineering, nursing, surveying etc. The graduates got the occupational license for their future carrer. Yet, their recognition may not be suitable in other districts. If they want to work in other area in Asia, they may have to use several years for the preparation of the examination due to the difference of the test between Hong Kong and other cities. It is a serious drawback of the suggestion and let me disagree the suggestion.<br />\n<br />\nApart from that, low salary is another problem. Hong Kong is a metropolis. We can get higher salary when we worked in here. Yet, when we work in other cities, like Taiwan or Korea, we only can get lower salary. Although it does not affect the daily life too much, the problem of lower salary will reflect on the the moment you have to buy some goods which came from other places instead of local stores. For instance, you have to pay a half of your monthly salary to buy a newest model IPhone if you worked in Hong Kong. In the contrast, you have to use a whole monthly salary to buy an IPhone if you worked in Taiwan. Not to mention when you need to give some money to family for the normal usages of home."},{"pid":"47338d8a811eb6bc6aba8f090da92ba1fbe9b42e","tid":625068,"uid":62274,"like":0,"dislike":4,"score":-4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-04-11T06:40:26.000Z","msg":"出唔晒<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLast but not least, the graduates are hard to be comfortable in other countries due to the cultural difference. As we are Chinese people, we are keen to eat spicy hot pot or stinky tofu instead of sushi or kimchi. The graduates could not eat Hong Kong&rsquo;s style food frequently when they worked in other cities. It will let them feel homesick. On top of the culinary difference, the more serious problem of working overseas is the discrimination. Raical discrimination in other districts is not unusual, especially in Japan and Korea. According to the survey of SCMP, Japanese and Korean hate the colleagues who came from different countries very much. Also, other racial people who worked in Japanese company are difficult to become an important position because of the racial discrimination. The graduates will be stress when they worked in this suffocating atmosphere. Thus, the suggestion is inappropriate.<br />\n<br />\nIn conclusion, based on three aforementioned problems which concluded the problem of recognition, the low salary and cultural difference, I strongly oppose the suggestion. You have to think twice if you want to work overseas in the future."},{"pid":"03cd9ad832e9b76a050ba078a50c615d2595cac3","tid":625068,"uid":100014,"like":5,"dislike":1,"score":4,"quote":{"pid":"fbdb8c5c841a461fc1f3139fd250c7c1dac66106","tid":625068,"uid":62274,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":5,"replyTime":"2018-04-11T06:36:46.000Z","msg":"小弟今年係重讀生 見就嚟考英文<br />\n想各位巴絲幫下手 講下有啲咩要大改善 同埋大概有無lv3<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\nQuestion:You are the President of the Student&rsquo;s Union at your school.

You are preparing a speech to welcome new students on the first day of school. In order to help new students achieve success and have an enjoyable school life, you want to talk about the following in your speech:<br />\n&mdash;importance of following school rules<br />\n&mdash;importance of interpersonal relationships<br />\n<br />\nGood morning Principal, teacher abd fellow students,<br />\n<br />\nOn behalf of the Student&rsquo;s Union, i&rsquo;d like to welcome all of you to our school. I&rsquo;m sure we all want to achieve success and have an enjoyable school life, so this morning I&rsquo;d like to give you some advice.<br />\n<br />\nTo become a successful people, following school rules is essential. School creates school rules for protecting us. For example, we&rsquo;re not allowed running on the floor anytime and the reason for the regulation is that reducing the chance of facing danger with us. Apart from that the consideration of protection, school rules can be used to constrain our temptation. School is a miniature of society. We need to have discipline in our society and school is no exception. Complying the laws is similar to conforming the school rules. All successful people in our society obey the law. Thus, this is fundamental to us.<br />\n<br />\nBesides, the interpersonal relationship is also important for us. You can meet friends easily if you have better interpersonal relationship. It can expand your social circle and let you meet more friends who have similar habits to you. On top of this, when you had more friends who came from different background, it is helpful for you to tackle the problems you faced. Everyone has his special ability. In the whole secondary school life, we can&rsquo;t deny that we&rsquo;ll get into some troubles. You can solve it easily if you had many friends. It&rsquo;s quiet important for the secondary school life.<br />\n<br />\nAll in all, i hope my sharing can inspire you to do some meaningful things in your following six years in our school. When you joined and clubs, don&rsquo;t forget to be hard-working in academy as this is the responsibility of student. Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish! Enjoy your secondary school life! Thank you!"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-04-12T16:34:46.000Z","msg":"最好一段一個point <br />\n同埋第三段 interpersonal relationship 同 meet friends easily 中間小左好多因果關係 同埋係咪用make friends 好d<br />\n行申英文都廢<br

are the President of the Student&rsquo;s Union at your school. You are preparing a speech to welcome new students on the first day of school. In order to help new students achieve success and have an enjoyable school life, you want to talk about the following in your speech:<br />\n&mdash;importance of following school rules<br />\n&mdash;importance of interpersonal relationships<br />\n<br />\nGood morning Principal, teacher abd fellow students,<br />\n<br />\nOn behalf of the Student&rsquo;s Union, i&rsquo;d like to welcome all of you to our school. I&rsquo;m sure we all want to achieve success and have an enjoyable school life, so this morning I&rsquo;d like to give you some advice.<br />\n<br />\nTo become a successful people, following school rules is essential. School creates school rules for protecting us. For example, we&rsquo;re not allowed running on the floor anytime and the reason for the regulation is that reducing the chance of facing danger with us. Apart from that the consideration of protection, school rules can be used to constrain our temptation. School is a miniature of society. We need to have discipline in our society and school is no exception. Complying the laws is similar to conforming the school rules. All successful people in our society obey the law. Thus, this is fundamental to us.<br />\n<br />\nBesides, the interpersonal relationship is also important for us. You can meet friends easily if you have better interpersonal relationship. It can expand your social circle and let you meet more friends who have similar habits to you. On top of this, when you had more friends who came from different background, it is helpful for you to tackle the problems you faced. Everyone has his special ability. In the whole secondary school life, we can&rsquo;t deny that we&rsquo;ll get into some troubles. You can solve it easily if you had many friends. It&rsquo;s quiet important for the secondary school life.<br />\n<br />\nAll in all, i hope my sharing can inspire you to do some meaningful things in your following six years in our school. When you joined and clubs, don&rsquo;t forget to be hard-working in academy as this is the responsibility of student. Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish! Enjoy your secondary school life! Thank you!"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-04-13T03:54:38.000Z","msg":"What is your name"},{"pid":"b662c178caf6b6e3ce6d902d067149747df18545","tid":625068,"uid":55097,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"ddcb898f0b7b345ff8ca4d876f0a7a17c1521458","tid":625068,"uid":110892,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-04-13T03:47:44.000Z","msg":"無啦啦貼護照已經ON9<br />\n<br />\n仲要搬埋奧巴馬老豆出黎, 好搞笑<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://coe.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/2017%20COE%20Annual%20Report%20Page%2004.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcoe.hawaii.edu%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2017%2520COE%2520Annual%2520Report%2520Page%252004.jpg&h=a0666629&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n[url]<a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-hawaii-manoa\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timeshighereducation.com%2Fworld-university-rankings%2Funiversity-hawaii-manoa&d=kQgFSJP9XBHiOkgzvsGqHleK4D04he4k8uKHxpzC8zE%3D&h=a8373bfd\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-hawaii-manoa</a><br />\n[/url]<br />\n<br />\nBusiness &amp;
