Deutsche Bank also began basing the chief executive officer for its Asia operations in Singapore instead of Hong Kong in August.<br />\n<br />\nThe number of nonlocal companies, including those headquartered on mainland China, with offices in Hong Kong  fell 0.2% from a year earlier to 9,025 as of June, according to a recently published annual survey by the Hong Kong government -- the first drop since 2009. The decrease expands to 2.8% when excluding mainland companies.<br />\n<br />\nOf the 9,025, the number of companies with regional headquarters in Hong Kong dropped 2.4% to 1,504, and those with regional offices dipped 0.4% to 2,479. The overall number of employees at nonlocal companies also declined by 10,000 to 483,000.<br />\n<strong><br />\nThe foreign exodus was particularly stark in the financial sector, with 52 banks and financial companies and 24 insurers leaving the city. The Vanguard Group, The Motley Fool and others have also announced their exits from the city since June.</strong><br />\n<br />\nBarings said it has &quot;nearly 100 professionals&quot; in the city and the &quot;Hong Kong office will continue to be our biggest office in Asia.&quot; Still, it is expected to shift some operations to its new office in Singapore."},{"pid":"edbc919c612d5e4c533279530f5d0b425f39aa92","tid":2378385,"uid":55089,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-01-24T12:09:57.000Z","msg":"<img
