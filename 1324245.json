This should be your first and the only priority and nothing should come before that.<br />\n<br />\nPictures and videos (please see attached) proved that 2 of your colleagues lead the way for a group of armed police and walk them inside the New Town Plaza shopping mall. It  turns out the armed police were using excessive force to not only block almost all the way out and attack the innocent citizens. Most of your customers are families with pregnant women, children in schools and elderly over 70s and I am sure none of them should have been experiencing this in a top tier Hong Kong shopping mall. <br />\n <br />\nYour action on leading the way for the police into the mall has obviously endanger the safety of the citizens and you have put the shopping mall into battlefield.  You yourself, have brought an irretrievable damage on the New Town Plaza shopping mall public image. <br />\n<br />\nAs a citizen who has been living in Sha Tin for nearly 30 years, I strongly condemn your action on allowing the armed police getting in the New Town Plaza shopping mall. I also demand for an investigation of your senior management/ security department arrangement on letting the armed police in the shopping mall. <br />\n<br />\nYour sincerely,<br />\n<br />\nLetter to condemn: New Town Plaza allowed armed police entering the mall without permission on 14th July 2019"},{"pid":"d1b261611d095bc3e814ab7aa2013798d284d3be","tid":1324245,"uid":6833,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-16T14:47:36.000Z","msg":"幫手推"},{"pid":"df9218157ba52105fa53244e35b2dfc2edaa1a03","tid":1324245,"uid":119864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-17T00:38:41.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2379815112297857&amp;id=2048175568795148\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Fstory.php%3Fstory_fbid%3D2379815112297857%26id%3D2048175568795148&d=4wcocBccBPvk8MIeFEbr%2BRF66oQwccw1TbdUPfwT%2FAY%3D&h=e7a6b128\" target=\"_blank\">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2379815112297857&amp;id=2048175568795148</a>"}]}
