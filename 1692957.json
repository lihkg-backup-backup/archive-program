I am in objection towards PFCR.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the Chief Executive, the power of enactment of PFCR arose from section 2 of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (&ldquo;ERO&rdquo;).  ERO is an outdated regulations that was enacted before the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (&ldquo;HKBORO&rdquo;).  The power of enactment conferred by ERO to the Chief Executive in Council (&ldquo;CEIC&rdquo;) did not take into considerations the protection of fundamental rights as promised HKBORO.  Section 5 of the HKBORO only permits derogation in the exceptional circumstances of a public emergency, namely where the life of the nation is at risk.  The blanket prohibition on face covering is a disproportionate derogation of HK citizens&rsquo; basic fundamental rights.  It restricted HK citizens freedom of expression and freedom of speech, promised by both HKBORO and the Basic Law (&ldquo;BL&rdquo;) and which is disproportionate and without legitimate grounds.  <br />\n<br />\nThe enactment of PFCR by CE is also inconsistent with BL48, BL62 and BL65 to the extent that it permits the CEIC to bypass the Legislative Council (&ldquo;LegCo&rdquo;).  It is the primary duty for the LegCo as the legislative branch to enact law, while the Government, as the executive branch, only enjoys the power to draft and introduce bills, motions and subordinate legislation to the LegCo (BL 62(5)).  Section 3(2) of PFCR stipulates a person contravenes section 3(1) of PFCR is liable to maximum imprisonment of 1 year and a fine at level 4.  The power of the CEIC to make general law with criminal consequences must be restricted to exceptional circumstances of a public emergency and when it is not possible to convene the legislature.  The CE has herself denied the state of emergency when announcing the enactment of PFCR in a press conference at 3 p.m. on 4 October 2019.  PFCR is a product of the Government abdicating of the LegCo&rsquo;s duties as the legislature (BL 66 and 73) and a violation of the separation of powers between the Government and the Lego (BL 62 and 73).<br />\n<br />\nIn fact, after PFCR came into effect on 5 October 2019, clashes between Police Force and citizens continue.  Although section 4 of PFCR provides a statutory defence for persons having lawful authority or reasonable excuse to use a facial covering and Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu on the date of enactment has explicitly said reporters in the field would be protected, the Police Force clearly has an contradicting view.  Senior Superintendent and Ng Cheuk-Han and Tse Chun Chung John at press conference on 8 and 28 October 2019 respectively said the law did not specify journalists would be exempted under the work-related category, while police in the field continuing to pull off reporters&rsquo; masks.  Since PFCR came into force, we see PFCR has offered us little protection and is often abused by Police.   <br />\n<br />\nIn view of the above, I object to PFCR.<br />\n<br />\nRegards,"},{"pid":"106f3fda7c0d773d853f44b5e19cccb51ec742b9","tid":1692957,"uid":311337,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T10:47:23.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"7bfcf4ca68beff3f7eec8e96ac0e1e9ff9658654","tid":1692957,"uid":109820,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T10:47:54.000Z","msg":"推 順便借位<br />\n<br />\n【認真參考日本社運】想行得遠過藍絲，不如唔好再鬧同路人啲ig？<br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1692734\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1692734</a>"},{"pid":"e464f9158248da5634842fa8fdde6f49d99bb762","tid":1692957,"uid":204049,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T10:56:43.000Z","msg":"自推 <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/math.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d53eedbd554d700554f1d218f1b55cf5b0b8d76a","tid":1692957,"uid":138790,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T13:38:20.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f2f4ff117faf18ab1231b8e14de885977e6e3148","tid":1692957,"uid":70745,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T13:57:22.000Z","msg":"幫手推"},{"pid":"b3197965a5f5cff7b4352c20eebe5912792b7330","tid":1692957,"uid":70745,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T13:57:42.000Z","msg":"香港人真係好撚忙，放工番屋企冇停過"},{"pid":"53d6b1303b2c7ea510718ec2f9ac7b4756a9efa9","tid":1692957,"uid":196006,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T15:18:16.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"a2d3d6f721ffdc8124400dccfe5c2f4a2e6c5cce","tid":1692957,"uid":196006,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T15:18:31.000Z","msg":"推十次"},{"pid":"433929bddbaa4829e9c8d0bfd768d9a50c170bbc","tid":1692957,"uid":105254,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T16:33:48.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"941e4e9831dd32658c34069fc8d6f2528189c17a","tid":1692957,"uid":62270,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T22:03:34.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"a0fcd224e81a46cf1cab9ebde134c6b686716b2b","tid":1692957,"uid":63117,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T22:05:18.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"f3b6eef24a04ebbacc3a7f88a00aaf05e0b0476b","tid":1692957,"uid":263197,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T22:28:18.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"2e933b4a261a96340867f6edb67e430fea8af5e7","tid":1692957,"uid":126622,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-05T02:48:18.000Z","msg":"點解冇人推"},{"pid":"10a6e431ba6685350144a7c85918defcbcf5305d","tid":1692957,"uid":65753,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-05T03:08:18.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"97fb2f22290d9e1c2b1d2977b5151ce8693d2cdb","tid":1692957,"uid":105254,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-05T05:23:19.000Z","msg":"推啊"},{"pid":"5cc0a04c85156216bcac06fd1206d9074001ff8e","tid":1692957,"uid":3149,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-05T05:32:22.000Z","msg":"Push <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"3eed0e4459b363694411b9eb8b89975f2a7664c6","tid":1692957,"uid":4322,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-05T05:33:04.000Z","msg":"Pishhh"},{"pid":"830e97e3ed85e21025c58d198ef0f4a72aa2b969","tid":1692957,"uid":130934,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-05T05:54:09.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"911a000a95f7be52033b3fdbbbf50ea5f5e5a651","tid":1692957,"uid":34144,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-05T06:24:12.000Z","msg":"已交<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
