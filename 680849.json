Despite the odds, I'm confident that I'll be in Russia to make you all proud. Your love and support will give me the strength I need.<br />\n<br />\nEgypt international&nbsp;Mohamed Salah&nbsp;will need only three weeks to recover from injury, a close friend of the&nbsp;Liverpool&nbsp;star revealed on Sunday.<br />\n<br />\nThe 25-year-old was forced off the field after an unfortunate clash with Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos in the&nbsp;Champions League final&nbsp;on Saturday night. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, there were several mixed reports on the extent of the injury including a dislocated shoulder and a clavicle fracture.<br />\n<br />\nAmong these estimates included the possibility of Salah missing the World Cup, which Egypt sealed qualification for with a famous penalty by Salah in dramatic fashion against Congo. With all factors taken into account, Salah missing the World Cup would be a truly heartbreaking conclusion to a phenomenal season which has seen him score 44 goals in all competitions for Liverpool.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, Aly Mazhar, a former footballer and a close friend of Salah, announced on his Facebook page on Sunday that scans revealed that the Liverpool star suffers a strain in the shoulder ligaments and that he&rsquo;ll be back on the field in three weeks.<br />\n<br />\nIt remains unclear whether Salah will be ready for Egypt&rsquo;s opening match against Uruguay on June 15. The Pharaohs will then play against Russia and Saudi Arabia on June 19 and June 25.<br />\n<br />\nIn the meantime, Egypt will play friendlies without Salah against tournament heavyweights Belgium and Colombia on June 1 and June 6."},{"pid":"c94324a7864da90616ed50fef567727891542252","tid":680849,"uid":72621,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"15af9d7e3f844f6701497b48d40e76306519a462","tid":680849,"uid":30040,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-05-27T13:32:08.000Z","msg":"甩胶邊可能兩星期咁快，你想以後掂下就甩咪兩星期囉<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-27T16:58:15.000Z","msg":"佢都唔係甩<br />\n係扭傷"}]}
