We're looking for what happened.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nMr Trump added: &quot;China will do anything they can to have me lose this race.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe Republican president said he believes Beijing wants his likely Democratic challenger Joe Biden to win in November's election.<br />\n<br />\nMr Trump also said he is sceptical of data indicating Mr Biden would win.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I don't believe the polls,&quot; the president said. &quot;I believe the people of this country are smart. And I don't think that they will put a man in who's incompetent.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nUS media reported earlier in the day that Mr Trump had erupted at political advisers last Friday evening about internal polling that showed him losing in critical states.<br />\n<br />\nHis aides have doubts about whether Mr Trump will win crucial battlegrounds such as Florida, Wisconsin and Arizona, while some of his re-election team have all but given up hope of success in Michigan, according to the Associated Press news agency.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I'm not losing to Joe Biden,&quot; Mr Trump reportedly said, inserting an expletive, during a conference call with campaign officials."},{"pid":"f712a0efe95b46e22fc84e19c7a58a6e4237361a","tid":1995117,"uid":108374,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-30T04:18:44.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"70381fa76443a5296fd4164fc6f667d30d15e562","tid":1995117,"uid":127575,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-30T04:19:45.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0ceb8ebfe4c4ff66edeab0eb7ffd83f1524d24bd","tid":1995117,"uid":199957,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-01T02:52:54.000Z","msg":"好撚正常者<br />\n我諗Trump 咁講係想俾美國人有個意識 投CHINA JOE即係冇得搞支那"}]}
