Guangzhou has seen a growing migrant population in recent years and some locals claim African communities commit more crimes than other groups.<br />\n<br />\nWe hear from Juliet Hatanga, a senior magistrate from Uganda, who recorded the moment she was turned away from a hotel. The BBC's Danny Vincent visited Guangzhou and saw several hotels which were still rejecting people with African passports. Some hotel staff told him there was an order from the police demanding that hotels were not to take African bookings.<br />\n<br />\nWhat does all this mean for the burgeoning trade relationship between China and Africa? African oil and minerals are key supplies in China's domestic industrial development. Are these latest controversial measures in Guangzhou a symptom of problems in the partnership? We discuss this with Buddy Buruku, a digital financials services advisor at the World Bank Group in Ghana and Dr Jing Gu, a Chinese-born research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies in Britain's Sussex University.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cswgks\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fprogrammes%2Fw3cswgks&d=fsGHaT9mmPjonTOwxUe9frZGMQxn7aheim1dKZ3ASAU%3D&h=89f751c2\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cswgks</a>"},{"pid":"5ef045252cba0d384e8b17716576e3c867f34105","tid":772735,"uid":26389,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-08-09T04:15:40.000Z","msg":"第一次支持支那"},{"pid":"c873ede07872ad9828228918b7dd214a4d3c3036","tid":772735,"uid":14333,"like":3,"dislike":1,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-08-09T04:16:59.000Z","msg":"其實neon light 真係靚過led 燈牌好多<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n睇以前d 旅遊節目d 遊客好鐘意搭巴士影彌敦道d 招牌 <br />\n而家好似淨係得番佐敦有d 舊招牌感覺 <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"42da561d3f781a64092ced890b012d30a056d10e","tid":772735,"uid":41818,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"c873ede07872ad9828228918b7dd214a4d3c3036","tid":772735,"uid":14333,"like":3,"dislike":1,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-08-09T04:16:59.000Z","msg":"其實neon light 真係靚過led 燈牌好多<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n睇以前d 旅遊節目d 遊客好鐘意搭巴士影彌敦道d 招牌 <br />\n而家好似淨係得番佐敦有d 舊招牌感覺 <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-08-13T07:10:21.000Z","msg":"neon light先有feel<br />\nled冷冰冰"}]}
