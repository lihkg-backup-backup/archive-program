(AP/Mario Cabrera)<br />\nThere&rsquo;s been a lot of Black Mondays over the course of history. A massacre in medieval Ireland; fatal storms in 14th-century England; the 1977 closure of a steel factory in Ohio. Bleak stuff, and, depending on your job, maybe every Monday is black. But for stock traders and investors, the term will always be linked to October 19, 1987 &mdash; the day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 22.6 percent, its deepest single-day dip to date.<br />\nIt took a confluence of events to tank the market that fateful October. Ramped-up hostilities between Iranian and U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, a freak storm over England, the wariness of early attitudes toward computers and finance. Automated program trading and portfolio insurance are often blamed for the speed at which stocks were shed, but the exact cause may be unknowable. What&rsquo;s clear is that on October 19, stock markets around the world lost huge amounts of money in a very short time. <strong>Beginning with a severe drop in Hong Kong&rsquo;s Hang Seng Index, the crash accelerated in London&rsquo;s FTSE100, which had been closed the previous Friday due to extreme weather.</strong>Over the course of the day, the Dow dropped more than 500 points. In Australia and New Zealand, where its effects would be felt for years to come, they called it Black Tuesday."}]}
