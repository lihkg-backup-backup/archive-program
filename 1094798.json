Both designs will be equally valid for travel.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nA change in the design of the UK passport has proved a rallying point for Brexit supporters, with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage describing the 2017 decision to bring back the dark blue design as &quot;Brexmas&quot;.<br />\n<br />\n'Truly appalled'<br />\nNot everyone is happy at receiving one of the new passports - one recipient said she was &quot;truly appalled&quot; at the change.<br />\n<br />\nSusan Hindle Barone, who received her new passport on Friday, told the Press Association she thought the design should not change for as long as the UK remains an EU member.<br />\nShe said: &quot;I was just surprised - we're still members of the EU. I was surprised they've made the change when we haven't left, and it's a tangible mark of something which I believe to be completely futile.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;What do we gain by leaving? There's certainly a whole lot we lose.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile others are pleased they received one of the old passports after 30 March.<br />\n<br />\nSteve Rowe said: &quot;I received my new passport this week with a start date of 1 April, happy to say it still says European Union; I think we'll still be discussing Brexit when it runs out in 2029.&quot;"},{"pid":"aebb4db053eebb45ebd613c5ab45a974c228e505","tid":1094798,"uid":25858,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-04-06T14:53:59.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"9d6893ca22ef95bb65b697e655ece779a8b9c8e1","tid":1094798,"uid":51200,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-04-06T15:26:28.000Z","msg":"另類bno平權<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ea0e6e725786ea367e3d71fa586fc3b09bcad732","tid":1094798,"uid":68728,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-04-06T15:27:37.000Z","msg":"點解唔直情轉埋色?"},{"pid":"34384c90ee4bf02eebe56b1c080b685cb8390ab2","tid":1094798,"uid":62257,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-04-06T17:39:29.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
