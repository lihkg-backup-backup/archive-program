Most of the time, people are trying to look for a perfect partner or soul mate which sounds like an impossible and unachievable task. Have you ever had a long-term friendship or long-term love affair? How does the relationship end up? How is it going? If the relationship is still fairly constant for a long time. It feels like it will last forever, then congratulation. Maybe you have already found the right one.<br />\n<br />\nUnfortunately, not everyone is that lucky. Most of the people perpetually attempt to find the true person. Whether it's friend or partner. However, most of us don't have much luck. We keep trying and trying, facing a lot of hardship during the entire relationship, experiencing varieties of emotion. Happiness, sadness, anger, uneasiness.At last/In the end, you got dumped, she said she doesn't love you anymore. It all ends up a failure.It's all for nothing.<br />\n<br />\nIs it really worth it to engage in a relationship?People come into our lives and leave just like that.Some said people come into your life for a reason, Some said some people come into our lives and quickly go.What do you think? xD"},{"pid":"a9a0b7ad16fade0348fe3e52f8f0239303667ea0","tid":508496,"uid":89282,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2017-12-24T10:38:36.000Z","msg":"xDD"},{"pid":"116e3f7f82ec1612870b675446ceb36650a51f0b","tid":508496,"uid":112161,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"quote":{"pid":"a9a0b7ad16fade0348fe3e52f8f0239303667ea0","tid":508496,"uid":89282,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2017-12-24T10:38:36.000Z","msg":"xDD"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-24T10:40:23.000Z","msg":"Don&rsquo;t invest to much in a relationship.
