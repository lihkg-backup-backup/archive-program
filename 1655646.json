An organized gang in white T-shirts, most of them carrying offensive weapons, assembled at the Yuen Long MTR station and carried out indiscriminate attacks on innocent passengers and journalists. Amid the mayhem, civilians, regardless of their age and gender, desperately tried to escape the barrage of fists and canes. Some of them were mobbed and beaten up, faces covered in blood, while some others were rendered unconscious. Their pleas for help, however, fell on deaf ears. Two uniformed police officers appeared at the scene only to leave immediately after. Emergency calls made to the &ldquo;999&rdquo; emergency hotline by thousands of citizens to report the incident went unanswered. At one point, the Yuen Long police station even pulled down its shutters to block concerned citizens from seeking help. The police eventually showed up, but by then all attackers already left the scene.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe Yuen Long Terrorist Attack (July 21 Incident) spurred rumors of collusion between the Hong Kong Police Force (&ldquo;HKPF&rdquo;) and local triad gangs. On the same day, the Chief Executive (&ldquo;CE&rdquo;) Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and several high-ranking government officials held a press conference condemning the vandalization of the national emblem on the building of the Liaison Office of the Central People&rsquo;s Government in Hong Kong. The personal safety and security of Hong Kong citizens were the least of their concerns, and they paid scant attention to the legal responsibilities and abuse of power of the HKPF. None of the questions raised by the press was directly addressed. Daily press conferences held by the HKPF evaded questions from the media regarding such issues, which further fuelled anger among citizens."},{"pid":"e44d3c363132f585ab6bf856891bd87f4cb5435e","tid":1655646,"uid":44331,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-15T07:26:35.000Z","msg":"In the past, Hong Kong used to be seen as the world's premier financial hub. Its success was due in no small part to its well-established legal system independent from mainland China and various civil liberties enjoyed by the region, including the freedom of speech and freedom of the press. To those who are familiar with Hong Kong, the scene at Yuen Long MTR station would seem astoundingly surreal and beyond belief. When we first started working on this report in early July, we merely intended to make an objective analysis of the law enforcement situation by the HKPF and the regulatory framework in place. No one could have anticipated that the situation would deteriorate so rapidly: the July 21 Incident, the August 31 Incident, undercover police participating in the protests in order to arrest protesters and first-aiders, reports of torture of detainees at the San Uk Ling Holding Center (accused of being a &ldquo;concentration camp&rdquo; where extrajudicial punishments were carried out) and visits from lawyers and Justices of the Peace were denied. We are gravely concerned not only about the abuses of power by the HKPF that run contrary to the expectations of the Hong Kong people, but also whether the existing checks and balances are sufficient to regulate the behavior of the HKPF, and whether the Department of Justice is conducting prosecutions in a fair and unbiased manner. Clearly, the core of the problem is not merely misconduct of individual HKPF officers, but rather the unprecedented governance crisis caused by the erosion of the rule of law.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nEven after countless rallies and conflicts, the government reluctantly withdrew the extradition bill, but remained deaf to all the other demands of the Hong Kong people. Calls for an independent inquiry into the HKPF were repeatedly ignored or denied. In response to this, we started this effort to gather publicly available information on suspected police abuses, explain the existing law on policing and how they are suspected to be violated, and the current supervisory framework. Although we lack the legal power to summon witnesses, we tried to base everything in this report on objective evidence. We hope our conclusions would be indisputable to a reasonable reader. In the end, we do not know how much impact this report could bring, but we hope every bit of effort would be of assistance to Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n23 July 2019<br />\n<br />\n(Amended in September to reflect current status)"},{"pid":"a724656d1ad4649c9a537bcd35324454aeb30678","tid":1655646,"uid":17378,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-15T07:29:05.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"ca54a6124d90454617f2ffd3733a18069a85cbfa","tid":1655646,"uid":12662,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-15T07:35:02.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"77588fe4f7f321ebee8925b280f5ea8296b5d5e0","tid":1655646,"uid":189650,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-15T07:36:41.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"431aa15cf8e7c6a0df96d04018b9793e59ed677f","tid":1655646,"uid":274996,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-15T07:37:52.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"bc1ae4b5bf78d69ec402089f1ea40073534bcf88","tid":1655646,"uid":288577,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-15T07:41:19.000Z","msg":"P牌推唔到<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/whip.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a05f24fe3678e824cf7cddfec655894126cd0ac5","tid":1655646,"uid":320013,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"94b04109107a85eafd67ec38b67c57cb14fecbe9","tid":1655646,"uid":44331,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-10-15T07:25:44.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/xiG5HXV.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FxiG5HXV.png&h=b21b2659&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nSince June 2019, people in Hong Kong rallied in massive numbers in opposition to the proposed extradition bill.

Protests were met with intense crackdown, accompanied by widespread reports of police abuse and misconducts. <br />\n<br />\nCalls for an independent inquiry into the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) were repeatedly ignored or denied by the Carrie Lam government. In response to this, in July 2019, a group of citizens launched an effort to assemble publicly available information and conduct an independent investigation into the HKPF's actions.<br />\n<br />\nThe investigation report consists of 7 chapters, with chapters 3 to 6 making up the core of the report. Chapter 3 outlines the legal authority of the HKPF, explaining the expected behavior of the police when performing their duties. Chapter 4 describes the current complaint mechanism of the HKPF, and attempts to analyze its deficiencies and possible grey areas. Chapter 5 provides a compilation of evidence of suspected abuse of power of the HKPF since June 2019.
