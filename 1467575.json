Had been live tweeting the discovery of the Chinese cop since it first happened. <br />\nAfter about an hour of him being quizzed, they tried to move him. It seemed that they would exit him via a human passageway. I was right at the front of the passageway ready to film it. It quickly became apparent that it wasn&rsquo;t a passage way out but a gauntlet for a mass beating. The guy was already beaten up. Now the crowd began to punch and kick him. <br />\nOther media looked on and filmed. But I&rsquo;m just not this kind of person, and I had to protect him, with my own body for nearly 40 mins. <br />\nPretty intense. <br />\nNow...<br />\nI support escalation. I vividly understand how angry Hong Kongers are. I know I shouldn&rsquo;t get actively involved. I also know that he was a Chinese cop, dressed as a protester, caught with sticks, and so had evil intentions towards HK. <br />\nBut on a human level I could not stand by, or even walk away from a man being beaten to a pulp. <br />\nSo yeah it was a rough ride. <br />\nThe angry protesters respected what I was doing, and never intentionally hit me, not once. But, I got a few accidental knocks. <br />\n-<br />\nI&rsquo;m sorry this happened. <br />\nI dunno what the outcome should&rsquo;ve been. I don&rsquo;t even know if my protecting him with my own body was the right thing to do. <br />\n-<br />\nThis isn&rsquo;t a war. It&rsquo;s a revolution, we&rsquo;re fighting a system, not individuals. <br />\nI think many protesters acted really badly tonight. <br />\nBut, I also blame the HK police too. Their actions on Sunday, when they dressed up as protesters and then started beating and arresting people changed everything. Everyone is on a hair trigger now and riddled with paranoia and anger. <br />\nI said on Sunday, after this despicable tactic, any cop or agent provocateur caught by the protesters would be in life threatening danger. Well, I was proven right tonight, and also got a proxy beating for it. <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\nAnyway, I&rsquo;m all fine. A few scratches and bruises over my body and face. <br />\nHK is very much broken. Only the government can stop this. <br />\nIn the meantime, get out and protest whenever you can. Every little will help in the long run.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/567628880005099/posts/1955710974530209?s=1016147694&amp;sfns=mo\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F567628880005099%2Fposts%2F1955710974530209%3Fs%3D1016147694%26sfns%3Dmo&d=4IYAvm%2F2ThyFbSIl4Y3Ij28KfKULefuOMk0AcQ9dAAw%3D&h=9ae2512e\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/567628880005099/posts/1955710974530209?s=1016147694&amp;sfns=mo</a>"},{"pid":"a5fd082dc27ae03442de3c61807146d24b179281","tid":1467575,"uid":560,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:28:16.000Z","msg":"唔係唔俾你做 但有救護個刻就好收手<br />\n係人道問題！"},{"pid":"65e1f5094e143830634c754afcc839cb6f1f5b3b","tid":1467575,"uid":5205,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:28:46.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">必須保護100%和理非行動 <br />\n<br />\n我地可以提早決定100%和理非定 有後續 <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n警察風向 破壞連登 咩淪陷 唔好信<br />\n<br />\n信左就中警察計<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n和理非 取消黑衫行動 勇武就無左保護 鬼亦無咁多機會滲透<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n一定要支持 勇武就無左保護 自然要勇武休息下<br />\n咁鬼既滲透亦無左機會。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n但係 講到明有下場既就全民黑衫 （例如免費過海之類）<br />\n<br />\n機場只宣傳 同控制人流 有人搞事就 比泛民 等泛民開記者會<br />\n<br />\n幫手講佢係鬼 <br />\n<br />\n另外唔建議帶口罩 和理非活動係要一家大細都可以參與<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n我建議民陣遊行必須 100%和理非 否則就當卧底</span>"},{"pid":"882911e2d3a03814a54ea1dc9b95df5aa1ea7c6d","tid":1467575,"uid":108347,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:29:21.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"color: red;\">我真係唔明WO,話就話係&quot;唔係咁好睇&quot;,但係比人打左2個月而家打隻鬼就講到會割,811只係過左3日你覺得大家真係善忘到咁?仲有721呢?比人打足2個月呢?食煙食足2個月呢?咪玩啦,諗改善就得,民意係唔會逆轉</span>"},{"pid":"cc9748883c043322675ae9d8afe284fbeb4d2a80","tid":1467575,"uid":35347,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:29:43.000Z","msg":"鏡頭影住真係好肉酸<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8e76521cbe724a076132d4ad5de7204dd672e0a6","tid":1467575,"uid":279650,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:35:08.000Z","msg":"--------分享------<br />\n【檢討】可唔可以應承，以後唔好再喺operation途中內鬨，留vs散，互相捉鬼？<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1457810\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1457810</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<br />\n3, 4, 5點看一下 想一下<br />\n吳志森：咁落去，呢場運動會輸 而且輸得好甘！（分析＋建議，請入黎睇睇）<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1460980\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1460980</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"345210182291bf5036a5a256f6b4bde814066cef","tid":1467575,"uid":268160,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:38:33.000Z","msg":"Push"}]}
