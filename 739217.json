style=\"color: red;\">美國10日公告2,000億美元中國商品清單，對此，北京向WTO控告，但未獲得WTO成員國的回應，各國主要是敦促中共努力改進經貿政策。</span>週三，美國駐世貿組織（WTO）大使表示，解決中共不公貿易政策已超越WTO的能力。<br />\n<br />\n世貿組織週三（7月11日）召開中國貿易政策檢討會議，美國副貿易代表兼駐WTO大使謝伊（Dennis Shea，中文姓名為習達難）於會中表示，中國（中共）對國際貿易的影響非常重大且持續增長，中共主導的重商主義及貿易和投資方式，對其貿易夥伴造成嚴重損害。<br />\n<br />\n謝伊說，「對中共這種行為的評估再也無法推遲了，WTO目前還沒有解決這個問題所需要的所有工具。」<br />\n<br />\n按照規定，WTO每兩年召開一次中國貿易政策檢討會議。這類會議通常舉行三天，第一天先由受檢討會員報告貿易體制，再由其他會員發言。第二天，沒有安排會議，受檢討會員針對其他會員的提問準備回應內容。第三天，受檢討會員簡要報告回應內容後，其他會員提出進一步問題。<br />\n<br />\n出席這項會議的日內瓦貿易官員向路透社透露，中共商務部副部長王受文在會中表示，美國10日公告2,000億美元中國商品清單，擬加徵10%關稅，對此，北京將向WTO控告，並且呼籲所有WTO成員對抗欺凌、保護主義和單邊主義，以及應對美國對鋼鋁材和汽車的關稅威脅。<br />\n<br />\n不過，多個WTO會員11日的發言，並未回應中方的呼籲，他們主要是敦促中共努力改進經貿政策，日本、加拿大、歐盟和瑞士對網絡安全、產能過剩和中共當局在經貿政策中所扮演的角色等提出關切。<br />\n<br />\n歐盟駐WTO大使Marc Vanheukelen在會中表示，歐盟業者面臨中共各項措施的障礙，包括與許可證有關的規定，以及知識產權執法不力。<br />\n<br />\n「隨著中國（中共）越來越關注創新和高科技生產，這些貿易障礙需要得到解決。」他說。<br />\n<br />\n謝伊說，中共當局對中國經濟的作用日益增加，在中國大陸開展業務或與中國對手競爭的外國公司，面臨著更深層次和更廣泛的障礙，北京正在提供「大規模且扭曲市場的補貼」，並且以「各種手段扭曲競爭環境」。<br />\n<br />\n他認為，WTO的爭端解決制度只關注具體政策，對於政府主導的政策，普遍凌駕在市場力量（market forces）之上的情況，WTO束手無策。另一方面，WTO的談判不太可能處理這種情況，而且在WTO架構下應對這個問題，都要花很長的時間。<br />\n<br />\n「最好的解決方案是中國（中共）主動接受，且採取全面及有效的開放及市場導向的政策。」謝伊說。#<br />\n<br

row, the Senate pushed back on President Donald Trump, showing stiff resistance to his key policy decisions on tariffs and NATO even as the President is at a summit in Europe wrestling with allies over those same issues.<br />\n<br />\nSenators voted overwhelmingly Wednesday calling on Trump to get congressional approval before using national security as a reason for imposing tariffs on other nations, as he did recently with steel and aluminum levies against Mexico, Canada and the European Union.<br />\n<br />\nThe bipartisan 88-to-11 tally on the non-binding resolution sends a message to the White House about how frustrated senators are over Trump's disruptive moves on tariffs.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHowever, future efforts to pass enforceable legislation likely face an uphill battle over Trump's objections.<br />\n<br />\n Key House Republican urges Trump, Xi to meet and &amp;apos;craft a solution&amp;apos; to escalating trade war<br />\nKey House Republican urges Trump, Xi to meet and 'craft a solution' to escalating trade war<br />\n&quot;Let's be clear, this is a rebuke of the President's abuse of trade authority,&quot; said Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican and a frequent and vocal critic of Trump's policies. &quot;Can you imagine being Canada and being told your steel and aluminum exports to the United States (are) a national security threat?&quot;<br />\n<br />\nOn Tuesday, the Senate voted 97-2 in favor of a pro-NATO resolution, just as Trump was touching down in Brussels and blasting the security alliance on Twitter for a host of reasons, including that many nations don't spend 2% of their GDP on defense.<br />\n<br />\nThe tariffs measure was written by Sen. Bob Corker, a retiring Tennessee Republican who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican and a free-trader from a steel producing state. They believe this vote will help build momentum for future tougher legislation, although it is not clear if they could get supermajority support in the Senate and House to override a likely veto, especially if Trump worked actively against it.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;This is a vote for Congress to assume its rightful role,&quot; Corker said. &quot;It's a baby step.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe measure would require congressional approval of tariffs issued under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which requires national security concerns to be the driving reason for imposing the tariffs.<br />\n<br />\nMexico, Canada and the European Union -- longtime allies of the US -- were incredulous they were considered a national security risk to the United States and issued tariffs against US goods in response.<br />\n<br />\nExclusive: Trump invokes War of 1812 in testy call with Trudeau over tariffs<br />\n<br />\nThe vote on the tariffs measure helps clear up another matter for Senate GOP leaders and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who are working diligently to get Trump's judicial nominees confirmed.<br />\n<br />\nFlake used his ability in the narrowly-divided chamber to block appeals court judges as leverage for forcing a vote on the tariffs measure. That stalled action in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor while GOP leaders worked to find a way to assuage Flake.<br />\n<br />\nFlake initially insisted he would only accept a vote on a &quot;substantive&quot; measure but accepted the non-binding resolution instead. He told CNN he would lift his &quot;holds&quot; on those judges following this vote.<br />\n<br />\nView on CNN"}]}
