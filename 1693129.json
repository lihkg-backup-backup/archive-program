Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well, certainly, there are those who are more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable. But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent...&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot; ...More than four hundred years ago, a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words-they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest that you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.&quot;"},{"pid":"af4909cd8afe20b627ad37e04f05fd5d2e76cf79","tid":1693129,"uid":175975,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T12:20:31.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"0817fc22228c060f2ade78a27b891174b8313df4","tid":1693129,"uid":175975,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T12:22:49.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"c119b1b7ac2c77f7cbcc7ab16dd4754adddd1456","tid":1693129,"uid":175975,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T12:24:48.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"f757a503920759dd8476c6c32a4b06811fea45a2","tid":1693129,"uid":175975,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T12:32:38.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"c2a1fc1f62e7115b0b8877a68dd17e4920394634","tid":1693129,"uid":263197,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T12:33:33.000Z","msg":"Good evening London, allow me first to apologise for this interruption."},{"pid":"b9ab1af9444bff4bf2b63dadeef935224827d886","tid":1693129,"uid":48631,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T12:34:01.000Z","msg":"仲以為係let it go改歌詞"},{"pid":"9d6f44ff5428a0da8a0a8fe2ddca9c9ba5b26087","tid":1693129,"uid":175975,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T12:37:46.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"053b28acaceeb2e628de53acdddb6ea3c4180848","tid":1693129,"uid":175975,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-04T13:00:57.000Z","msg":"push"}]}
