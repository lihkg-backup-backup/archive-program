It also showed us how much effort and patience would be needed to experience the beauty of music responsibly. It also has shown how important &ndash; indispensable &ndash; part of our humanity is live music.<br />\n<br />\nThe hopes that accompany us in January 2021 make us believe that live music will come back, unrestricted by the sanitary regime, that the concert halls will be full again and the brilliant interpretations of music will allow us to experience beauty together.<br />\n<br />\nWe believe that the awaited 18th International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition will take place in in October 2021.<br />\n<br />\nTaking care of our common safety as well as the comfort of the participants, jurors and the audience, we have decided to change the dates of the Preliminary Round of the Competition.
