Dearlove added that he thought it unlikely to have been released deliberately, but that China had clearly tried to cover up the release.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I I think this started as an accident. This raises the question of whether China will assume responsibility and whether China should pay compensation. I think this will make all countries think through their relationship with China and how they relate to China's leadership,&rdquo; said Dearlove.
