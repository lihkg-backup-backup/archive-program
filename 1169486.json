The chart shown a range of data of transportation methods collected from pupils&rsquo; travel to and from school, the data was analysed in millions of trips per year. <br />\n<br />\nThe overall data collected suggested that there is a general reduction in most of the transportation methods when comparing the 1990s&rsquo; to 2010s&rsquo;, with an exception of children being the car passengers. One of the most significant changes in the mode of transportation is pupils travelling by car that has rapidly increased to an approximately 11 million in 2010, in comparison with 4 million in 1990 who travelled by car. The increase of pupils travelling by car is the highest in 2010 compared with different transport method, in contrast it is about 5 times more than cycling in the same year. Whereas walking was more favourable in 1990 given it was the most popular transportation method used, an approximately 12 million of trips was recorded in 1990 compared with 6 million in 2010.
