He lives in Hong Kong while his girlfriend is working in Japan. He's faithful to her and would never cheat on her. He lives on The Peak and owns many houses. Unlike Mayweather, he's never ostentatious though extremely wealthy. You can find out how ostentatious Mayweather's lifestyle is on YouTube such as his car and house collections. He always wears ostentatious jewellery such as gold necklaces, rings and silver bracelets. He loves driving flashy cars and wearing flashy clothes. Do you remember the incident in Langham Place where the escalator stopped and reversed dierction at a speed two to three times as fast as normal causing people to fall and pile up at the base of the escalator. People were screaming as they tumbled down the escalator. Some people managed to grab the handrail and steady themselves. The incident occasioned a good deal of worry. When you were in primary and secondary school, were there any subjects which you weren't interested in so didn't engage much in the classes? I remember I didn't engage much in geography class. I was often daydreaming. Ken loves video games. I remember him playing Counterstrike in which he used a gun to single-handedly engage ninety nine enemies who only had knives lol. By the way he hadn't heard his cousin for years until this afternoon when he received a call from her. They chatted in exquisite delight. His younger brother is currently a head chef at a five star hotel and he feels he's found his niche. His younger sister too has found her niche as a professor having worked as a researcher for three years. His cousin is robust and healthy. He does lots of strength and conditioning exercises in his robust trainers. After his gym session, he usually drinks a cup of robust coffee and a glass of robust wine. He lives in Korea where the political system and economy are robust. His uncle opened an antique shop which created a favourable impression on me. There is an exquisite antique which engages my interest. I bet the shop engages lots of passers-by. I formed a favourable impression of it. Both of us are kickboxing fans. Like swimming, it requires an exquisite sense of timing. It used to be big in Japan but today it's most popular in the United states but not as popular in the global scheme of things. He said he wanted to train kickboxing privately rather than in a kickboxing club so he engaged a training partner to train with him instead. The residential estate he lives in consists of houses instead of flats. Each house has at least one retractable awning or canopy. The canopy could be made of glass, cloth, steel, stainless steel or concrete. In his garden he planted a lychee tree, a mango tree and bushes. He also grew lots of flowers such as orchids and roses. He mows the grass every now and then. He sometimes hires a gardener to manicure his garden. I'm reading a book called Parallel Worlds written by physicist Kaku. When he was explaining the theories on a television show, it captured my attention. It's fascinating book that explores the science of time travel, wormholes, eleven dimensional hyperspace and parallel universes, subjects that engage numerous readers around the world. I find the subject of wormholes most engaging. It was an international bestseller for many months."},{"pid":"b406ed208ff52a06d7d0d464796042136bfb6170","tid":1582408,"uid":41859,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-20T06:28:09.000Z","msg":"屌左羊閪未"}]}
