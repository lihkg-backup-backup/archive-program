His condition was critical. Online videos showed that after the injured was shot and fell to the ground, the police prevented a protester from helping him. 3 minutes passed when police officers went to check on the student. Dr. Alfred Wong Yam Hong, cardiologist at Tuen Mun Hospital and member of the M&eacute;decins Inspir&eacute;s professional group, criticized the action of police as utterly unreasonable.  One main concern was why the police did not immediately attend to the injured. He says that a bullet in the chest could easily be lethal, and the fact the police chose to intentionally disregard the injured showed that they were extremely cruel and inhumane. <br />\n<br />\nDr. Wong noted that the left chest held a lot of major organs including the heart, the lungs, the subclavian artery, the aorta thoracalis, etc. The incident could have been fatal if any of those organs were shot and medical attention was not given within a few minutes. In fact, the patient had been very lucky to live through the most critical stage. If the patient developed tension pneumothorax, or if excess air in the thoracic cavity had led to asphyxia or a lung collapse, the situation could become life-threatening within a few minutes.<br />\n<br />\nThe patient could have died immediately. Dr. Wong stresses that it was extremely inhumane to leave a person suffering from gunshot injury unattended.<br />\n<br />\nSource: RTHK news<br />\n<a href=\"https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1483910-20191002.htm?archive_date=2019-10-02\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.rthk.hk%2Frthk%2Fch%2Fcomponent%2Fk2%2F1483910-20191002.htm%3Farchive_date%3D2019-10-02&d=2%2FeNT3TbtuwIHwt2a%2FmQGKof2S8NuZTczTYEA3Eyx%2FE%3D&h=78a59a44\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.rthk.hk%2Frthk%2Fch%2Fcomponent%2Fk2%2F1483910-20191002.htm%3Farchive_date%3D2019-10-02&h=af18eb66\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1483910-20191002.htm?archive_date=2019-10-02</a>"},{"pid":"a3f75d9b85b0dcde4a4476fc191e395a53c21363","tid":1615399,"uid":76310,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T05:39:45.000Z","msg":"班黑警無人性<br />\n<br />\n幫我將英文版本推上twitter<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e5fa8263a3b2ab41f763b45aa1f30bbb593a5156","tid":1615399,"uid":259329,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T05:40:09.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"d3376c7e41927a99b0fda078ef247344f8c42a72","tid":1615399,"uid":56751,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T05:50:12.000Z","msg":"sorry 阻一阻<br />\n<br />\n【濫暴與公義】認為想清算班狗一定要等到「獨立調查」請入<br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1615406\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1615406</a>"}]}
