In the first world, many people think this is damaging and wrong but others would argue that their work brings them a sense of contributing, belonging and responsibility. What is your opinion?<br />\nA: Child working is still prevalent in third world countries. Nevertheless, it provokes controversy among the public since child working have both advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, I disagree that children should work because their work may handicap their study and children are unable t protect their right in the workplace.<br />\n  To begin with, we cannot deny that education is vital for the personal development of the children. A suitable environment should be provided to them to learn knowledge. If they spend their time on working rather than studying they will sacrifice their schooling time. It's hard for a child to concentrate on their job and their academy at the same time. Therefore, it will result in a low education level of next generation it will attribute to the serious drawbacks to the children themselves ,and thus , to a substantial society.<br />\n  Furthermore,  children have deficiency of cognition about their personal rights , it may cause physical and mental harm to the children. In the workplace, children only realise that they need to follow the order from their boss and they don't have courage to reject some unreasonable requests, such as overtime working without compensation, works that required overwhelming physical strength and unequal treatment among workers. News that child workers get hurt in the factories  are frequently heard in India . It's a tragedy that children cannot grow under a shell offered by the adults. Consequently, child working will cause many harms to the children . And it will become a pressing social problem.<br />\n  In conclusion, child working will have a negative effect on their education and they are not well-protected in the workplace. In the light of this , children should not work at their age. <br />\n<br />\n282 words <br />\n<br />\n自知英文差 歡迎批評 就黎要考ielts 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"},{"pid":"fc0af1118bdd58bf013b1c31ceefed897d984e47","tid":1013099,"uid":232463,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-08T05:51:55.000Z","msg":"A:Child working is still prevalent in third world countries.
