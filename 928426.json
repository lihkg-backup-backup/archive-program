U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who is more of a protectionist, appeared to be set to play that role. But Treasury Secretary <span style=\"color: red;\">Steven Mnuchin</span> told CNBC Monday, &quot;it's clear that <span style=\"color: red;\">President Trump</span> is going to be the one who leads the negotiations, and the team will be an inclusive team.&quot; <span style=\"color: red;\">Trump later confirmed that Lighthizer would lead</span> the team.<br />\n<br />\n( Mnuchin's description contradicts an earlier statement from <span style=\"color: red;\">Navarro</span>, who said Lighthizer would head the negotiations. Navarro, who among Trump's advisors has called for the most forceful approach to China, called Lighthizer &quot;the toughest negotiator we've ever had at the USTR.&quot; Lighthizer is also known to take a harsher line on China. )<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/04/muddled-white-house-message-on-trumps-china-trade-adds-to-market-woes.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2018%2F12%2F04%2Fmuddled-white-house-message-on-trumps-china-trade-adds-to-market-woes.html&d=1sVcEiuYA9%2FCtHdq16%2FHB5UWI6eGpREPWAa3TRi9Bo4%3D&h=ca89c8b6\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/04/muddled-white-house-message-on-trumps-china-trade-adds-to-market-woes.html</a><br />\n<br />\n( <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/03/trump-china-trade-talks-and-nafta-fight-in-congress-set-up-key-stretch.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2018%2F12%2F03%2Ftrump-china-trade-talks-and-nafta-fight-in-congress-set-up-key-stretch.html&d=1sVcEiuYA9%2FCtHdq16%2FHB5UWI6eGpREPWAa3TRi9Bo4%3D&h=7b05eed8\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/03/trump-china-trade-talks-and-nafta-fight-in-congress-set-up-key-stretch.html</a> )"},{"pid":"916ab0a147e51ec1fab98c75959b312ff4fd6ddb","tid":928426,"uid":147314,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-12-04T23:02:31.000Z","msg":"U.S. officials like Mnuchin and Kudlow also emphasized that <span style=\"color: red;\">nothing had been put down on paper yet</span>, and they gave no solid time frames for when investors could hope to see concrete agreements.
