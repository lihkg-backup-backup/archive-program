Each house has at least one retractable awning or canopy. The canopy could be made of glass, cloth, stainless steel, steel or concrete. This morning, my next-door neighbour&rsquo;s canopy was leaking all over the floor in my garden due to heavy rain. The water pipe attached to their stainless steel canopy was also dripping water 💦 down the wall onto my floor so I asked if I could enter their garden and wipe the water pipe and the edge of the canopy to stop water from leaking from them. My brother too entered their garden and helped mop the edge of the canopy and the water pipe to stop water from leaking out of them. There was a leak in their canopy so they had a bucket underneath for the water to drop into but the bucket was overflowing all over the floor which caused flooding. Then we placed another bucket beside it but very soon water began to overflow from the bucket. I tried to soak up the water with towels but it was impossible. Water soaked into my shoes👟 . Rain too soaked through my brother&rsquo;s shoes 👞 and clothes 👕Some of our neighbours said they had a leak inside their house 🏡 as well due to rain showers."}]}
