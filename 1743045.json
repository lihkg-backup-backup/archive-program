An unarmed crowd stands in a totally different position from an armed crowd. At Amritsar the crowd was neither armed nor attacking. [Interruption.] I carefully said that when I used the word &quot;armed&quot; I meant armed with lethal weapons, or with firearms. There is no dispute between us on that point. &quot;I was confronted,&quot; says General Dyer, &quot;by a revolutionary army.&quot; What is the chief characteristic of an army? Surely it is that it is armed. This crowd was unarmed. These are simple tests which it is not too much to expect officers in these difficult situations to apply.</blockquote><br />\n(from: <a href=\"https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1920/jul/08/army-council-and-general-dyer\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.parliament.uk%2Fhistoric-hansard%2Fcommons%2F1920%2Fjul%2F08%2Farmy-council-and-general-dyer&d=1ClhXrEf11pGEOLLd6amePolgVFqTZkzW3om5iGclzM%3D&h=14f5672a\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1920/jul/08/army-council-and-general-dyer</a>)<br />\n<br />\nIt relates to a massacre in India during British rule and Churchill gave a rather lengthy speech condemning the British officer in charge.  I listened to it as an audio recording a while back and was surprised at how relevant it was to HK and China.

It set the rules that we've tried to play by for a century.<br />\n<br />\nIf you want the support of the Western world, and you need it, then don't break those rules.  Protesters are allowed a certain class of weapons.  If you use the other class, firearms... even bows and arrows, then you are no longer protesting.  <strong>You are an army and armies can be legitimately slaughtered.</strong><br />\n<br />\nDon't go there."},{"pid":"2387e5fb70e776837515818b45ff1b2066c9a14f","tid":1743045,"uid":331173,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-23T14:58:51.000Z","msg":"but they have archery classes at school, what about they are doing sports?<br />\nplus, I wonder if those who doing too much violence was the undercover since it was proved by a Chinese spy, that they have sent a lot of spy to invade to schools committee, like the IPCC.<br />\nso, no one is checking and the PLA/HKPF could do anything or say whatever they say.  since they have already suppressed or take control of the medias."},{"pid":"ff4b66d7b6b910885e638f52b43d13038305cf00","tid":1743045,"uid":335057,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"2387e5fb70e776837515818b45ff1b2066c9a14f","tid":1743045,"uid":331173,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-23T14:58:51.000Z","msg":"but they have archery classes at school, what about they are doing sports?<br />\nplus, I wonder if those who doing too much violence was the undercover since it was proved by a Chinese spy, that they have sent a lot of spy to invade to schools committee, like the IPCC.<br />\nso, no one is checking and the PLA/HKPF could do anything or say whatever they say.  since they have already suppressed or take control of the medias."},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-23T21:23:34.000Z","msg":"There are chemistry classes at university too... doesn't make it okay to build a bomb.<br />\n<br />\nWhataboutism is a trap for the protesters.

Achieving your goals requires you raise the cost of the CCP continuing their current path.  The ONLY way you can do that is with Western public support, support demanding their governments take economic and political action against the CCP.  That <strong>is the cost</strong> of their actions against you.  Dead police don't cost them, destroyed property doesn't cost them.  They would prefer you do that as it makes the real cost they have to pay less.  You will lose support from the west and the west will, in turn, continue to do business with the CCP, thus helping them survive.<br />\n<br />\nEconomics is the only support you're going to get.  No one is going to HK to fight a war with the CCP.  That would, at best, destroy HK.  At worst, destroy the world.  <strong>It's not going to happe</strong>n.  <br />\n<br />\nWhat can happen is that the Chinese economy is separated from the rest of the world and the Chinese people give up on the CCP, destroying it from the inside.
