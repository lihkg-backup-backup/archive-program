That&rsquo;s my style of play.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to criticise Messi when he walks on the park. If he scores three goals are you going to say: &lsquo;Ah but he&rsquo;s walking on the pitch?&rsquo; No. You can&rsquo;t tell me how to play.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m here today, it&rsquo;s as I am. No one has told me how I must behave. That&rsquo;s my football, that&rsquo;s all.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;People can like it or not. Do I need this to be loved? Do I need people to judge me differently? Or do they talk better about me?&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nPogba also dismissed concerns over his perception, saying he chooses not to focus on the opinions of others, so long as he is doing what he enjoys and has the support of those close to him.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to live on what people think, for them to say that I&rsquo;m nice, good, the best, perfect. Everyone has their opinion. And I respect that.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I play football, I do what I like. My relatives support me, they&rsquo;re more important.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t love everyone and be loved by everyone. That would be perfection and nothing is perfect in this world.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be offended if someone says: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t love you.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s your right. You don&rsquo;t have to love me.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"b6a6d3ebbb44d06bb7e4f096a2713c7c4088cf5b","tid":691207,"uid":187584,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T13:37:43.000Z","msg":"位置上都同林伯謝四史高斯比啦，<br />\n同美斯比你不如同紐亞比。<br />\n<br />\n不過其實普巴真係跑咁小咩? <br />\n有無師兄有數據分析下??"},{"pid":"3627f6daf91a59cf8c34d5aafea7ba042c4efeca","tid":691207,"uid":121496,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T13:46:49.000Z","msg":"你應該係第三個po"},{"pid":"98ee758f9d1dc3435b474152c7a162356449de06","tid":691207,"uid":83481,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"b6a6d3ebbb44d06bb7e4f096a2713c7c4088cf5b","tid":691207,"uid":187584,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T13:37:43.000Z","msg":"位置上都同林伯謝四史高斯比啦，<br />\n同美斯比你不如同紐亞比。<br />\n<br />\n不過其實普巴真係跑咁小咩? <br />\n有無師兄有數據分析下??"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T14:03:08.000Z","msg":"其實好多時唔係跑得多定少<br />\n係有冇必要<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n普巴問題係人地打反擊,比人直入中路對住中堅<br />\n或者有人後上插入係佢附近佢冇近人入<br />\n呢D好致命"},{"pid":"c09f9006fc3b426d00d44fdef68e63dd76c6b5dc","tid":691207,"uid":171754,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-05T06:36:37.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"}]}
