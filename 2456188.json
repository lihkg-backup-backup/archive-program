The contracts made Google the default search engine on 86 percent of U.S. smartphones. And the company acknowledged making &ldquo;humongous&rdquo; payments to carriers solely to keep rivals like Yahoo and Microsoft from getting prime access to people&rsquo;s devices.<br />\n<br />\nThose findings came from the FTC&rsquo;s antitrust attorneys, who concluded that Google was breaking the law by &ldquo;banishing potential competitors&rdquo; from mobile phones. They proposed the FTC sue and seek a settlement requiring changes to Google&rsquo;s contracts. The agency&rsquo;s economists took the opposite view, recommending against a suit because mobile commanded only a small share of the market.<br />\n<br />\nBut those antitrust investigators only make recommendations. The decision on what action to take rests on the FTC&rsquo;s five commissioners, presidential appointees who operate independently of the executive branch. One of the commissioners, Republican Tom Rosch, was a hold-over from the George W. Bush years. Three others &mdash; Republican Maureen Ohlhausen and Democrats Julie Brill and Edith Ramirez &mdash; were Obama nominees. FTC Chair Jon Leibowitz was a Bush pick, but Obama elevated him to chair and then nominated him for a second seven-year term.<br />\n<br />\nIn most cases, commissioners of both parties follow the advice of the FTC attorneys, widely seen as experts in the cases they investigate, said Kovacic, who spent seven years as an FTC staffer before he became a commissioner and later chair under President George W. Bush.<br />\n<br />\nThe Google probe was different. In this case, the commissioners followed the recommendations of their staff economists, who argued that the mobile market for search was too small to pose an antitrust issue.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/16/google-files-mobile-search-market-475576\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F03%2F16%2Fgoogle-files-mobile-search-market-475576&d=Hu0SY4Cx1oodln7cCHpxbXobfi2nm8u4SjNJtTZF4Nk%3D&h=455399f4\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/16/google-files-mobile-search-market-475576</a>"},{"pid":"a4c0954bb6d0e67a3b1d4cb35d131f17c1b3d958","tid":2456188,"uid":256837,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-21T17:12:01.000Z","msg":"好多科企都係黑馬扶起，所以係咁幫佢哋審查言論<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"86606193864515ecd669156a2c38b06180976f55","tid":2456188,"uid":66324,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-21T17:19:32.000Z","msg":"&quot;經濟學家認為冇&quot;<br />\n經濟學家不嬲燈過燒生"},{"pid":"a61691ac563bf9d3bbb2569a9dbedb948f45c711","tid":2456188,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-21T17:20:25.000Z","msg":"得閒順手做任￼￼￼<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://Hotels.com\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&d=Hu0SY4Cx1oodln7cCHpxbXobfi2nm8u4SjNJtTZF4Nk%3D&h=08fb9b65\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">Hotels.com</a>、Expedia，買定離手未呀？<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/2455904\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/2455904</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"be1d77cc3affa9ca6c67d8cbb2f8114109dd0a56","tid":2456188,"uid":11148,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-21T17:22:46.000Z","msg":"經濟學家存在係世上就係不停食屎食到死<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n一個世界上最冇用最垃圾職業<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"fe16dd614ebfa1b0cb03779949850f9ca9683cdf","tid":2456188,"uid":54930,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-21T17:24:23.000Z","msg":"唔係揀聽經濟學家講唔告，係揀唔告果邊黎聽<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"fee1a3711a2a6e57568d8af4a3bdf37a5b4b12b6","tid":2456188,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"fe16dd614ebfa1b0cb03779949850f9ca9683cdf","tid":2456188,"uid":54930,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-21T17:24:23.000Z","msg":"唔係揀聽經濟學家講唔告，係揀唔告果邊黎聽<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-21T17:24:53.000Z","msg":"冇錯<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ad870e8f3cc110993b472f1254388a910b37f8ba","tid":2456188,"uid":9542,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-21T17:34:24.000Z","msg":"歐洲罰左咁多次錢，google 係歐洲咪一樣打橫行"}]}
