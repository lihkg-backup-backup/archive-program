Electronic Arts, was brought to Californian court by three FIFA 21 gamers, Jason Zajnoc, Danyael Williams, and Pranko Lozano. In the suit, they claimed EA SPORTS uses &ldquo;deceptive practices&rdquo; and &ldquo;false advertising&rdquo; to drive sales in their FUT mode.<br />\n<br />\nThe lawsuit suggests EA willingly and &ldquo;unlawfully&rdquo; tricks FIFA players into buying Ultimate Team loot boxes by &ldquo;utilizing artificial intelligence technologies that adjust game difficulty dynamically.&rdquo; As mentioned, this is known as &lsquo;scripting&rsquo; by fans.<br />\n<br />\nEA回應: 毫無根據的指控<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\nEA has responded to the Zajonc v. Electronic Arts lawsuit.
