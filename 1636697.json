While everyone knows that SCMP is under Alibaba&rsquo;s control for ages, I really think readers should begin to doubt its status as an independent media. <br />\n<br />\nThis article itself is about the Houston Rockets tweet but pay attention to the last sentence! I think the journalist left that sentence there deliberately because she wants people to understand that the voices of the reporters of SCMP are gradually being silenced by the company. In other words, while this is an article for a supposedly neutral newspaper about how Moray and the NBA succumbed to Chinese pressure, and then how Alibaba has spoken out against Moray, that last sentence seem to be giving a hint how their supposed claims of independence from state control is a thing of history. <br />\n<br />\nBut if you read articles by individual reporters (instead of those under the collective name &lsquo;SCMP reporters), it&rsquo;s still quite visible how the frontline reporters are still vast predominantly supportive of the movement&mdash;but then instances like this shows that the reporters are no longer in control of the paper&rsquo;s standpoint anymore. It&rsquo;s not quite as bad as HK01 and CCTVB yet but it seems to be getting there. <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/censored.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/censored.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a03de0c5d14a3ec0571f4da362713b9f74d20e0a","tid":1636697,"uid":327228,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-07T19:45:27.000Z","msg":"Tui"},{"pid":"4c22601d78f7162d12f740e1c189a6f6a4ecfa50","tid":1636697,"uid":45206,"like":7,"dislike":0,"score":7,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2019-10-07T19:45:44.000Z","msg":"SCMP is pro-Beijing.
