Indeed, I was half-hoping my loaner phone would be an SE. I was long hoping Apple would make an iPhone SE 2 with the iPhone X design language, and was incredibly disappointed when I had to reluctantly conclude that all hope was lost.<br />\n<br />\nI said I&rsquo;d return to the topic of the iPhone 8 screen size, and that&rsquo;s because one thing struck me about it. If you took the iPhone SE case size, and put in an iPhone X-style near-bezel-free display, it would be almost exactly the size of the iPhone 8 screen. It again made me really, really want an iPhone SE 2.<br />\n<br />\nIs all hope still lost? I think so, but I do have perhaps a tiny bit more hope than I did. Declining iPhone sales, and subsequent price-breaks may have had Apple rethink its future lineup plans. An iPhone SE 2 with a near-bezel-free design wouldn&rsquo;t be a cheap iPhone, but it could be made for a lower cost than the iPhone X/XS thanks to smaller screen size. Max out the storage at 128GB instead of 256GB (or 256GB instead of 512GB, if Apple upgrades the flagship storage tiers this year). Make a few other small compromises. I&rsquo;d accept that.<br />\n<br />\nGive me an iPhone 8 size display in an iPhone SE housing, and that&rsquo;s a phone I&rsquo;d buy immediately."}]}
