I remember seeing her live at Saitama Super Arena which was marvelous and unforgettable. She's been strutting her stuff since she was young so don't sell her short. At the end of her last encore she bowed onstage soaking up the applause. She received a thunderous standing ovation. On top of being a great musician, she is an avid runner. She took part in a five hundred meter race in which she came first. She rose to the challenge of passing the runners who were ahead of her earlier, ran for all she was worth and dived over the finish line. Loads of fans congratulated her on having won the race as she held the trophy up. The race was the opportunity for all the best female runners in Kyoto to strut their stuff. It was truly memorable. There's an elegant cafe nearby of which the interior and the exterior are artistically and exquisitely designed. My friend spilt his cappuccino all over his work the other day so he had to wipe the spilt coffee up. I enjoy drinking coffee and chatting with the baristas there so much that I occasionally make it worth their while. I remember dining at a nearby ramen restaurant after the concert. The table was sticky maybe the staff forgot to wipe it up so I asked them to wipe it up. Later I spilt a bowl of miso soup all over the floor as well as down my tie and in my shirt so I had to wior up the spilt soup. I had a nice chat with a lady sitting at a nearby table who told me once upon a time an entire village was wiped out by a super gigantic earthquake. Fascinating. When I finished my meal I wiped my mouth on my sleeve lol and a tissue."}]}
