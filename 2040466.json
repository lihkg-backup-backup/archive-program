The international community has a significant and long-standing stake in Hong Kong&rsquo;s prosperity and stability. Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong&rsquo;s own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people&rsquo;s liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong&rsquo;s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous.<br />\n<br />\nChina&rsquo;s decision to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong lies in direct conflict with its international obligations under the principles of the legally-binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration. The proposed law would undermine the One Country, Two Systems framework. It also raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, and undermines existing commitments to protect the rights of Hong Kong people &ndash; including those set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.<br />\n<br />\nWe are also extremely concerned that this action will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong. Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year.<br />\n<br />\nThe world&rsquo;s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation. Beijing&rsquo;s unprecedented move risks having the opposite effect.<br />\n<br />\nAs Hong Kong&rsquo;s stability and prosperity are jeopardized by the new imposition, we call on the Government of China to work with the Hong Kong SAR Government and the people of Hong Kong to find a mutually acceptable accommodation that will honor China&rsquo;s international obligations under the UN-filed Sino-British Joint Declaration."},{"pid":"22a9323465c2a59fc36ff646919077054a297108","tid":2040466,"uid":198866,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-28T15:03:18.000Z","msg":"聯合聲名相對溫和，美國自己出啦屌"},{"pid":"e0a72b3d6db492f6cefb019fa4c3d67593109e2d","tid":2040466,"uid":301946,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-28T15:03:34.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"4c1062788fc3f85272815a197e2b6a66ecb67b52","tid":2040466,"uid":103230,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-05-28T15:03:48.000Z","msg":"old news"},{"pid":"470c5251e749ef543a0fddf8c65b2b6626a68426","tid":2040466,"uid":70487,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-28T15:04:10.000Z","msg":"每日擠牙膏式預告開戰<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f4afcf2f2f08ab95fb32eb171627bc124e64bc6e","tid":2040466,"uid":190378,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"4c1062788fc3f85272815a197e2b6a66ecb67b52","tid":2040466,"uid":103230,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-05-28T15:03:48.000Z","msg":"old news"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-28T15:04:44.000Z","msg":"係咩<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f378afa7e30aa4d830094696aa7fee800a3dd3b3","tid":2040466,"uid":344949,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-28T15:05:38.000Z","msg":"強烈反對.jpg <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/cook.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"01deed6d29e458036110f82dd262c002a484571e","tid":2040466,"uid":287211,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"4c1062788fc3f85272815a197e2b6a66ecb67b52","tid":2040466,"uid":103230,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-05-28T15:03:48.000Z","msg":"old news"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-28T15:10:45.000Z","msg":"有幾old? 幾個鐘頭前？"},{"pid":"8209973fd7021536b98d41ecf3645b2485ae2a1c","tid":2040466,"uid":320078,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-28T15:47:04.000Z","msg":"出Joint statement應該係佢地表示站邊，話比中美兩方知<br />\n出招就一定係睇美國出，之後先敢出手抽水"}]}
