They do it, but they don't like it. They're always upset.<br />\n<br />\nWell ... that's a generalisation. But many times, I have seen women upset.<br />\n<br />\nI will also say I didn't like it either. Most of the time it's not necessary.<br />\n<br />\nThere's plenty of porn online. I think if people want to see naked bodies they can go online and find it. Those of us trying to make good, serious work ... why do we need to offer people gratuitous sex? It's not necessary.<br />\n<br />\nIt's silly to put people in situations where they are embarrassed or where they're worried about what their kids or husbands are going to think about them.<br />\n<br />\nThe work is not meant to make actors unhappy. It's meant to be good for the audience and good for us. </em>"},{"pid":"0effcdc9c7d8c2821ef5fc5b64b566a1dd272469","tid":2161355,"uid":134071,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-17T13:35:14.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/pJQ6F1n.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FpJQ6F1n.jpg&h=308d76d3&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"5ed43008c88a2ca38b9e076cd4b32ad7a2efd55a","tid":2161355,"uid":95138,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-17T13:41:45.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"62516cbf2c2985b5d28c25700faae4585a0c50f7","tid":2161355,"uid":104767,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-17T13:44:43.000Z","msg":"人老起唔到機"}]}
