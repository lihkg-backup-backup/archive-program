There is no significant nearby population or industrial centre. And its enormous scale goes far beyond the needs of the languishing Koh Kong resort nearby.<br />\n<br />\nIt wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time Beijing has engaged in major military infrastructure projects under the guise of building a casino.<br />\n<br />\nIts first aircraft carrier, the ex-soviet Riga, was bought from Ukraine in 1998 under the pretence of being turned into a floating betting facility and hotel.
