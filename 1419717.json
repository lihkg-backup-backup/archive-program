The people of Hong Kong deserve the true autonomy that was promised, with the full rights guaranteed by the Hong Kong Basic Law and international agreements.  The Legislative Council must finally take long-overdue measures to meet the legitimate democratic aspirations of the Hong Kong people &ndash; starting with completely and immediately withdrawing the widely-repudiated extradition bill.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Democrats and Republicans in Congress stand united with the people of Hong Kong in demanding the hopeful, free and democratic future that is their right.  We reiterate the call of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission Co-Chairs Congressman Jim McGovern and Congressman Chris Smith to the Trump Administration to suspend future sales of munitions and crowd control equipment to the Hong Kong police force.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;When we return to Washington, the bipartisan, bicameral Congress will begin our work to advance the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, and fight to preserve democratic freedoms and the rule of law in Hong Kong.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/JmDaqJ6.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FJmDaqJ6.png&h=41d8d33e&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"4efc068e9512d91c49ececae6f6a2d252e6513f3","tid":1419717,"uid":186071,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-06T02:24:04.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1382719615336493/posts/2213420855599694?s=596136172&amp;substory_index=0&amp;sfns=xmo\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F1382719615336493%2Fposts%2F2213420855599694%3Fs%3D596136172%26substory_index%3D0%26sfns%3Dxmo&d=UMlFbumbAr%2BzuUpIk3BrKQFhK%2BZ0PNwQmNlOVL%2F21oE%3D&h=911e66ab\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/1382719615336493/posts/2213420855599694?s=596136172&amp;substory_index=0&amp;sfns=xmo</a>"},{"pid":"100c6f35b4a27fce161556e5c5b82f45f1d6e088","tid":1419717,"uid":152568,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-06T02:24:43.000Z","msg":"We love you 3000 captain nancy"},{"pid":"7ffdff5d7af67263fd6f60d6717cf7b20c329978","tid":1419717,"uid":128923,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-06T02:25:28.000Z","msg":"佢同rubio 真係兩個反華先鋒 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7b3e899527147629c6467df89f6d1a7fdd6d985b","tid":1419717,"uid":152476,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-06T02:26:04.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"aae63a01d83e54e0974a198b55e602c55e899925","tid":1419717,"uid":144492,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-06T02:27:02.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\">快</span></span></strong>"},{"pid":"8d65fb6011db2d065392dbd0589c69b7ee48eada","tid":1419717,"uid":284732,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-06T02:27:50.000Z","msg":"In USA we trust!<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/love.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/love.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/love.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"906dcd3fec026f6b2c5dd2f5eb2cb110751c92ba","tid":1419717,"uid":77092,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-06T02:27:55.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"}]}
