It is called D614G, referring to the substitution of an amino acid called aspartic acid (D) for one called glycine (G) in a region of the genome that encodes the spike protein.<br />\n<br />\nBy the second wave of the outbreak in Houston, the study found that this variant had leaped to 99.9 percent prevalence &mdash; completing its domination of the outbreak.
