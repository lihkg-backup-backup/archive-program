Their logic is that if you learn to obey orders inside, you will learn to abide by the law outside. But I don&rsquo;t think doing foot drills well inside translates to following the law outside. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a linear relationship there for, say, youngsters engaged in drug-trafficking. Another thing is that you cannot say no. Normally you reply &ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo; during foot drills. But then, for example, I might say &ldquo;no&rdquo; when you ask me if there is anything I wish to add &mdash; in prison, the way to give a &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer is to say: &ldquo;Sorry, sir.&rdquo; In other words, &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; becomes the substitute for &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Why is it that I have to apologize in order to express an answer in the negative? Do I owe you something? That&rsquo;s their logic. One other thing is that you can&rsquo;t put your cup on the desk if you meet with correctional officers; you must put it on the floor. It doesn&rsquo;t take up much space on the desk &mdash; why can&rsquo;t inmates put their cups there? This is their way of showing hierarchy.<br />\n<br />\n[Ed. note: Hong Kong&rsquo;s Correctional Services Department tells TIME via email that this is not official policy.]</strong>"}]}
