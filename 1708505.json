Tensions are very high, if not inflammatory. I am greatly concerned by the disruption to regular University activities and the property damage on campus. All the more reason for us to appeal to you to stay calm, rational and avoid confrontation at any level.<br />\n<br />\nI wish to update you about the situation regarding police action on the University campus since midnight. Five of our students have been arrested and I have written to the Commissioner of Police to express my concern and to ask the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) to ensure the safety of the detained students and to observe fully their fundamental rights.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the past 24 hours, Deans, wardens, professors, CEDARS, security and other staff have devoted their best efforts to help defuse situations and find solutions. Some students have also sought to show understanding of mutual frustrations and have helped resolve some tensions. I am truly grateful to all those who are contributing to keep this campus safe and rational.<br />\n<br />\nAround 1:10 a.m. this morning, an HKU student was arrested in a public area just outside the campus on Pokfulam Road. University staff members were present to assist in defusing the situation.<br />\n<br />\nAround 7:30 a.m., the HKPF began clearing roadblocks that had been constructed on Pokfulam Road near the West Gate of the Main Campus. In the process, some students were chased onto the campus. Four HKU students were arrested.<br />\n<br />\nToday police presence was also observed on campus, and we were informed by the police that they were responding to 999 calls. We noticed that tear gas and pepper spray were fired in the vicinity of the campus.<br />\n<br />\nAgain I wish to bring to your attention the fact that the University has an established protocol with the HKPF regarding police entry onto campus grounds.<br />\n<br />\nThe in-principle agreement under the protocol is that the HKPF will not enter the campus, except in the following situations:<br />\na) To respond to 999 calls; or<br />\nb) To enter with a Search Warrant or Court order or other legal document.<br />\n<br />\nIt is important to also be aware that under Section 10, 50(3) and 50(4) of the Police Force Ordinance, a police officer may enter any public or private premises (without the need for consent) if the officer reasonably suspects that a person to be arrested is on the premises.<br />\n<br />\nWe understand that these are times when emotions are running high everywhere. We are also very saddened to see the casualties and loss of life arising from the protests. Let us remember that this is our campus, where we study and work, and we should safeguard it.<br />\n<br />\nOnce again, we urge all members of the University to stay calm, rational, and make safety their first priority.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nProfessor Xiang Zhang<br />\nPresident and Vice-Chancellor<br />\nand the Senior Management Team<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/heard.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/heard.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/heard.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n叫做咗野架啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"3434420ad8317de1b460541d690410824250e7f3","tid":1708505,"uid":46148,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:09:25.000Z","msg":"校長室唔洗要囉sosad"},{"pid":"b09738e1e533aa919e70726fd4c008a40f79a785","tid":1708505,"uid":141782,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:10:28.000Z","msg":"It is important to also be aware that under Section 10, 50(3) and 50(4) of the Police Force Ordinance, a police officer may enter any public or private premises (without the need for consent) if the officer reasonably suspects that a person to be arrested is on the premises.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n即係同學生割席呀？？"},{"pid":"e7276a0a92efa3554b83a84f4e7f82d16fbf2f05","tid":1708505,"uid":3241,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:10:48.000Z","msg":"呢條撚樣唔配做港大校長<br />\n垃圾"},{"pid":"92d2bdb8c55a91a38fe9ded37d257af02c230416","tid":1708505,"uid":249885,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:12:56.000Z","msg":"學生：<br />\n警方有權入喺有懷疑底下進入大學<br />\n<br />\n欽此<br />\n<br />\nxiang zhang"},{"pid":"f855b42f18501a047966b40063500eda4b44f281","tid":1708505,"uid":301585,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:16:38.000Z","msg":"in short: 大學將會與警方緊密合作, 任拉唔嬲"},{"pid":"a2e16cf01da0f659a6c02a0200dbc34a507f8210","tid":1708505,"uid":193786,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:18:37.000Z","msg":"姐係求其搵個藍絲打999都入得<br />\n大學已經不再安全<br />\n今日全部校長都龜縮<br />\n班狗一次過衝入咁多間學校<br />\n明顯deal好左"},{"pid":"f9527195f99abab965e03a2f1d05925b06a4e3a5","tid":1708505,"uid":24730,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:19:03.000Z","msg":"有史以來最無恥嘅港大校長"},{"pid":"ccfd103bb420578161cb55afd5d91037b29e5228","tid":1708505,"uid":32722,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:19:43.000Z","msg":"港大壽終正寢<br />\n一間大校既校長完全冇當學生係學生"},{"pid":"ecf2fc3d81a48a1be3ee36e642294c211169c02a","tid":1708505,"uid":212623,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:21:00.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/sick.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/knife.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"01c218dc8f78dfaf1346548fc4c7f6542b07216c","tid":1708505,"uid":57857,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:30:40.000Z","msg":"恥與為伍<br />\n5 年前Peter仔都仲識行落中環, 你呢張生?"},{"pid":"e50f7b6ae308447441e515754ff26a660e77d27e","tid":1708505,"uid":141782,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"01c218dc8f78dfaf1346548fc4c7f6542b07216c","tid":1708505,"uid":57857,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:30:40.000Z","msg":"恥與為伍<br />\n5 年前Peter仔都仲識行落中環, 你呢張生?"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:31:19.000Z","msg":"條撚樣唔篤灰都算<br />\n對佢有期望<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/heard.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/pointing.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7ef9c0c0bae802bc8c06997afa05ca7f4d4ded09","tid":1708505,"uid":53026,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T16:31:10.000Z","msg":"張翔是不可多得的人才。港大得到張翔，是冷手執個熱煎堆。我得到的路邊社消息是，張翔母校南京大學一早已經決定聘請他了。張翔亦已答應，並做好離職前的準備。然而南京大學忽然亮出了一個非常辣的條件，就是要求張翔及他的家人包括妻兒，都同樣放棄美國籍！<br />\n<br />\n          這可不容易，張翔的兒子自小在美國長大，長得像ABC，很難因為事業而影響家庭。條件談不攏，張翔只好放棄南京大學。此時，港大校長馬斐森任期未滿，突然「劈炮」。張翔在年紀、學術及領導才能都符合港大要求，加上一早已作好離職準備，港大真是求之不得。港大校長之職，挑戰重重，祝願張翔能披荊斬棘，帶領港大走向高峰吧。<br />\n<br />\n        潘麗瓊"},{"pid":"304be27ece6bb337f584e026a06f0f43c5e0f04a","tid":1708505,"uid":12110,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a2e16cf01da0f659a6c02a0200dbc34a507f8210","tid":1708505,"uid":193786,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T15:18:37.000Z","msg":"姐係求其搵個藍絲打999都入得<br />\n大學已經不再安全<br />\n今日全部校長都龜縮<br />\n班狗一次過衝入咁多間學校<br />\n明顯deal好左"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T16:44:46.000Z","msg":"明顯冇人打鐘意入就入<br />\n尻吹話有人打<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"262b241b3e70677afa700e5aefa29bec56e529aa","tid":1708505,"uid":325346,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-11T16:46:55.000Z","msg":"大陸佬食屎<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/fuck.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/fuck.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/fuck.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
