Hong Kong is one of Australia&rsquo;s most important trading partner and home to many Australian companies&rsquo; regional headquarter in Asia. It also acts as the middleman for many transactions between Chinese and Australian businesses.<br />\n<br />\nThe relationship between Hong Kong and Australia are intricate and mutually beneficial. Given the dire situation in Hong Kong, I would like you to consider to following measures to protect the people of Hong Kong, which would ultimately benefit Australia:<br />\n<br />\n1.Introduce the International Human Rights and Corruption (Magnitsky Sanctions) Bill to the parliament. The previous attempt lapsed at the dissolution of parliament at April 11, 2019. The bill is based on precedents from the United States and the United Kingdom and it would give powers to relevant ministers to make Australia a safer place that values universal liberal values.<br />\n<br />\n2.Include human rights protection clauses in the final ratified version of the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\n3.Consider offering special permanent protection for people from Hong Kong who currently resides or studies in Australia. Many Hong Kongers are highly educated and value western liberal values. This group would be a fine addition to Australia.<br />\n<br />\n4.Vet all visa and immigration applications from Hong Kong and China more thoroughly for the necessity of protecting the integrity of Australia&rsquo;s national security as some applicants could have active contributed or complicit in the violation of human rights as part of the police force, HKSAR Government, or private companies (for example, Cathay Pacific&rsquo;s management, which is terminating the contract of staffs whom have expressed sympathy or support towards the protest movement). Recent clashes on university campuses over the Hong Kong protests have also demonstrated that some foreign students neither understand nor value some basic rights we Australians cherish.<br />\n<br />\nI appreciate your time and I look forward to hearing back from you about your position on my proposals.<br />\n<br />\nYours sincerely,<br />\n<br />\nYour name"},{"pid":"1c968a5e57f2d68451235426bc08af43f298c429","tid":1593045,"uid":81996,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-25T01:44:53.000Z","msg":"<img
