Diplomats from Britain and a number of other countries, tried to attend the court proceedings but were denied entry.<br />\n<br />\nThe Shenzhen 12 have not had access to lawyers of their choosing, raising further serious questions about access to legal counsel in Mainland China. We expect China to uphold the rule of law and conduct trials in a fair and transparent manner, consistent with the basic requirements of international human rights law.〞"},{"pid":"b665f259a2d53db0a5c9d869524aad1595ae74ea","tid":2344345,"uid":24730,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-28T16:09:46.000Z","msg":"除夕唔好倒數，唔好叫新年快樂，用悲鳴聲代替<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/2342091\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/2342091</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"}]}
