I went to a college and got a Diploma of Technology in Electronics.  After a few years of work, I decided to apply at that same college and got a job.  I've been there a long time.  I like my college.<br />\n<br />\nSecond:  here's the breakdown on educational terms in BC (can't speak for other provinces):<br />\n<br />\n'Accredited' means the program is recognised by the government.  Anyone can start some business and call it a college or university.  But, an accredited college or university involves a lot more.  Stick with accredited institutions.<br />\n<br />\nA accredited 'Community College' means a lot of different things.  Some colleges specialise while others are very general.  My college offers Trades linked with apprenticeship programs for Automotive, Carpentry, etc..  These give specialised Trades designations allowing people to work in those fields.  They also offer 1 year Technician programs that give certificates, in Cook training to Electronics Networking.  Certificates are things that mean something to regional employers... they just know that someone with a particular certificate makes for a good employee.  They also offer 2 year (sometimes 3 year with coop work terms) in everything from Business to Civil Engineering, Nursing, Mechanical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, and Computer Science.  Again, these 2 year diploma programs are widely recognised in industry as &quot;good to hire&quot; and many also bridge into 3rd year University programs.  My college also offers 'Associate Degrees' in Arts and Science.  I have an Associate of Arts in Philosophy... that and a food-safe course will qualify you as a short order cook (sorry, standard engineering joke).  My college is large by Community College standards.  My college has a very good reputation with regional employers.<br />\n<br />\nAn accredited University offers what most people think of as Universities.  4 year Bachelor programs, Masters, Doctorates, etc..<br />\n<br />\nRealise that these institutions get the same money for domestic (Canadian) and International students.  International students pay a lot more because the institution doesn't get government funding for them.  But, there's another bit to this that most don't understand... the government rations funding for students, granting them as &quot;full time equivalent&quot; (FTE) numbers.  Thus, my college gets funding for roughly 9000 students a year.  But, we can bring in international students on top of that.  So, if we bring in 100 more international students, we can hire more instructors, we can offer more course sections, we can hire more support staff.  This is why International students are valuable to colleges and universities.  They allow us to expand our programs and offer more variety for everyone.<br />\n<br />\nThird, to specifics... last year our Technology grads (Computing, Electronic, Mechanical, and Civil) were pretty much all hired <strong>before</strong> they finished final exams.  Unemployment was running 3.1% and there was crazy demand.  Mechanical engineering students that were accepted for this year were differing (putting off starting a year) because they had jobs before they even took the program.  CRAZY!  It's a little more sane now, as hiring has become a lot more difficult with all the Covid restrictions, but I don't expect our recent grads will have too much difficulty.<br />\n<br />\nSo, yeah... if you want a job in industry, find a community college in the area you want to work that offers a program designed to meet the needs of those employers, because that's what community colleges do.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAnd, answering the original question on getting you prerequisites for a course.  First, you need to get an recognised English assessment test, which should be easy in HK.  Program-specific requirements are different... <br />\n<br />\n(and the lettering went red below so I think I'm typing too much)<br />\n<br />\nSo, just go here:<br />\n<a href=\"http://camosun.ca/international/future-students/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcamosun.ca%2Finternational%2Ffuture-students%2F&d=Bx5vHrS2V4FMjGMjdccONkV6NNh9RYlaag4wFuTDRgw%3D&h=05305b9f\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://camosun.ca/international/future-students/</a><br />\nBCIT probably has a similar page."},{"pid":"38c0c48d7c9403d1fe2ce6e838f6adde5347b53f","tid":2177989,"uid":335057,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-01T03:31:59.000Z","msg":"Oh... more:<br />\nIf you want that BS or BA <strong>Degree</strong> in BC, there are 3 ways:<br />\n<br />\n1) you go to university.<br />\n2) you take a college program that offers a bridge to a university program.<br />\n3) you take all the 1st and 2nd year &quot;University Transfer&quot; (UT) courses you can at a college that directly transfer to the university you want (they publish transfer guides) and then go to 2nd or 3rd year university after that.<br />\n<br />\nI'll explain #3.  College is way cheaper than university.  In a college, you'll have much smaller classes (some 1st year university classes are huge).  You'll have much better access to the instructor (generally no Teaching Assistants running 1st and 2nd year classes).  And, there's another reason to start in College.  Colleges are first come, first serve, not grade-pointed admissions.  If you meet the basic requirements, you just start taking courses.  Doesn't matter if you were a C+ student or earned all A's in high school.  By the time you're ready to go to university, it's pretty much your college marks that count.<br />\n<br />\nI mean, many of the first 2 years of university are general survey courses anyway... why not do them in a more friendly and much cheaper place?"},{"pid":"1ef568fd3b7e1c16757442c96940f6b64196b25b","tid":2177989,"uid":335057,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-01T04:11:50.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>...
