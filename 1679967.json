I enjoy visiting the annual winter festival where I ride the thrill rides and eat sushi soaking up the nice christmassy atmosphere. The sunlight has been dazzlingly bright all week so you may just as well have a good long soak in an outdoor onsen soaking up the sun. In fact I've just got out of an onsen and am drying myself on a towel. I thoroughly recommend taking the airport express in ifc. It's very easy. Once you're at the ifc exit where you can head straight for Queens road central, enter ifc, go past the escalator in front of you and keep going until you come to another escalator. Go down it, turn left and go straight ahead. It's there. If you wanna travel to Nagasaki from Fukuoka station, go through the gate, go down the escalator and look at the sign. You'll see which side is bound for Nagasaki. If you wanna have a coffee in J.Cafe, take the lift to level three, go straight down the path and pass several shops until you come to an intersection. Turn right and it's there. If you want to take the lift to a higher floor, turn tight at the intersection, pass several shops until you see pure fitness on your left, enter pure fitness and the elevator is there. However if you ask me whether australia is a great place to holiday in, I wouldn't bet on it. There's nothing worth doing there. I like Japanese culture and food. I took the JLPT at N one level in tokyo. My reading far outshines my writing so the marks i lost in writing were offset by those i gained in reading. My friend Amy took the test too. She's a little weak in speaking but strong on listening so the marks she gained in the listening part offset those she lost in the speaking section. After the test we spent money on clothes and shoes like it was going out of fashion. We entered a casino and gambled like it was going out of fashion. If you enjoy being in japan you might spend money on food and cosmetic products like it's going out of fashion. You might go to the casino and gamble like it's going out if fashion like we did."},{"pid":"1b8587103d438b3fed12f5d96fc1dad81057d8ec","tid":1679967,"uid":9435,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-30T13:41:56.000Z","msg":"日本邊到<br />\n日本好多停車場 <br />\n唔怕冇位泊車"},{"pid":"2179169b753c021b481c385e467ed63dc7680c9a","tid":1679967,"uid":122150,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"1b8587103d438b3fed12f5d96fc1dad81057d8ec","tid":1679967,"uid":9435,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-30T13:41:56.000Z","msg":"日本邊到<br />\n日本好多停車場 <br />\n唔怕冇位泊車"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-30T15:00:52.000Z","msg":"我就唔理嘅<br />\n去幾次都係泊附近，有最大料金果啲<br />\n大多數酒店parking都要錢，多數1000円，仲要係立體駐車，你一下想出夜街攞車就麻煩"}]}
