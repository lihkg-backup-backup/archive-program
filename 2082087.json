They complain about unfair recruitment and promotion policies, injured officers who become &quot;disposable&quot;, an emphasis on quotas instead of applying the law consistently, on politicization of policing priorities, and above all the city always settling cases against police misconduct so that accused officers never get a chance to clear their name in court, when innocent.<br />\n<br />\nWith this mindset, when they don't trust their own institution, the only people they trust are fellow officers -- not captains, not management, not the department, not the mayor. Which aligns with this article -- that Marines view the Marines as a trustworthy institution, while police don't see their own police department in the same light.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n要睇下呢本書先得. 香港黑警都係, 得番自己既&quot;兄弟&quot;, 同世界作對."}]}
