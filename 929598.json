The question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way:<br />\n<br />\nAlexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face -- miles and miles of face -- of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.<br />\n<br />\nMultivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough -- so Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could. They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share In the glory that was Multivac's.<br />\n<br />\nFor decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth's poor resources could not support the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both.<br />\n<br />\nBut slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact."},{"pid":"739faf95399847413b9eea5916452f6610da33aa","tid":929598,"uid":225002,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-12-05T17:16:19.000Z","msg":"The energy of the sun was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale.

All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.<br />\n<br />\nSeven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public function, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with contented lazy clickings, Multivac, too, had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that. They had no intention, originally, of disturbing it.<br />\n<br />\nThey had brought a bottle with them, and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It's amazing when you think of it,&quot; said Adell. His broad face had lines of weariness in it, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod, watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about. &quot;All the energy we can possibly ever use for free.

The sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are. But just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark.

His thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened.<br />\n<br />\nThe little Jerrodettes, both girls, had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self-conscious over the momentary sensation of inside-outness.

It ran the length of the room, disappearing through the wall at either end. It was as long as the ship.<br />\n<br />\nJerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a Microvac, that one asked it questions if one wished; that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination; of feeding on energies from the various Sub-galactic Power Stations; of computing the equations for the hyperspacial jumps.<br />\n<br />\nJerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship.<br />\n<br />\nSomeone had once told Jerrodd that the &quot;ac&quot; at the end of &quot;Microvac&quot; stood for &quot;analog computer&quot; in ancient English, but he was on the edge of forgetting even that.<br />\n<br />\nJerrodine's eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate. &quot;I can't help it.

Now the population doubles every ten years --&quot;<br />\n<br />\nVJ-23X interrupted. &quot;We can thank immortality for that.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Very well. Immortality exists and we have to take it into account. I admit it has its seamy side, this immortality. The Galactic AC has solved many problems for us, but in solving the problems of preventing old age and death, it has undone all its other solutions.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Yet you wouldn't want to abandon life, I suppose.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Not at all,&quot; snapped MQ-17J, softening it at once to, &quot;Not yet.

Population doubles every ten years. Once this Galaxy is filled, we'll have another filled in ten years. Another ten years and we'll have filled two more. Another decade, four more. In a hundred years, we'll have filled a thousand Galaxies. In a thousand years, a million Galaxies. In ten thousand years, the entire known Universe. Then what?&quot;<br />\n<br />\nVJ-23X said, &quot;As a side issue, there's a problem of transportation. I wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move Galaxies of individuals from one Galaxy to the next.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;A very good point. Already, mankind consumes two sunpower units per year.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Most of it's wasted. After all, our own Galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Granted, but even with a hundred per cent efficiency, we can only stave off the end. Our energy requirements are going up in geometric progression even faster than our population. We'll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of Galaxies. A good point.

His mind released its hold on the original Galaxy of Man, let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points. He never wanted to see it again.<br />\n<br />\nDee Sub Wun said, &quot;What is wrong?&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The stars are dying. The original star is dead.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;They must all die. Why not?&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;But when all energy is gone, our bodies will finally die, and you and I with them.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It will take billions of years.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I do not wish it to happen even after billions of years. Universal AC! How may stars be kept from dying?&quot;<br />\n<br />\nDee sub Wun said in amusement, &quot;You're asking how entropy might be reversed in direction.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nAnd the Universal AC answered. &quot;THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nZee Prime's thoughts fled back to his own Galaxy. He gave no further thought to Dee Sub Wun, whose body might be waiting on a galaxy a trillion light-years away, or on the star next to Zee Prime's own. It didn't matter.<br />\n<br />\nUnhappily, Zee Prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own. If the stars must someday die, at least some could yet be built.<br />\n<br />\nMan considered with himself, for in a way, Man, mentally, was one. He consisted of a trillion, trillion, trillion ageless bodies, each in its place, each resting quiet and incorruptible, each cared for by perfect automatons, equally incorruptible, while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other, indistinguishable.<br />\nMan said, &quot;The Universe is dying.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nMan looked about at the dimming Galaxies. The giant stars, spendthrifts, were gone long ago, back in the dimmest of the dim far past. Almost all stars were white dwarfs, fading to the end.<br />\n<br />\nNew stars had been built of the dust between the stars, some by natural processes, some by Man himself, and those were going, too. White dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released, new stars built, but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed, and those would come to an end, too."},{"pid":"684109534d50ee662ddbe0577d80faddb0cb2978","tid":929598,"uid":225002,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-12-05T17:19:07.000Z","msg":"Man said, &quot;Carefully husbanded, as directed by the Cosmic AC, the energy that is even yet left in all the Universe will last for billions of years.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;But even so,&quot; said Man, &quot;eventually it will all come to an end. However it may be husbanded, however stretched out, the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored. Entropy must increase to the maximum.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nMan said, &quot;Can entropy not be reversed? Let us ask the Cosmic AC.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe Cosmic AC surrounded them but not in space. Not a fragment of it was in space. It was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy. The question of its size and Nature no longer had meaning to any terms that Man could comprehend.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Cosmic AC,&quot; said Man, &quot;How may entropy be reversed?&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe Cosmic AC said, &quot;THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nMan said, &quot;Collect additional data.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe Cosmic AC said, &quot;I WILL DO SO.

Even AC existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to AC far less than was a man to Man.<br />\nAll other questions had been answered, and until this last question was answered also, AC might not release his consciousness.<br />\n<br />\nAll collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.<br />\n<br />\nBut all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships.<br />\n<br />\nA timeless interval was spent in doing that.<br />\n<br />\nAnd it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse the direction of entropy.<br />\n<br />\nBut there was now no man to whom AC might give the answer of the last question. No matter. The answer -- by demonstration -- would take care of that, too.<br />\n<br />\nFor another timeless interval, AC thought how best to do this. Carefully, AC organized the program.<br />\n<br />\nThe consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos. Step by step, it must be done.<br />\n<br />\nAnd AC said, &quot;LET THERE BE LIGHT!&quot;<br />\n<br />\nAnd there was light----"}]}
