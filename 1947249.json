In color film processing, for example, the cost of a 3-by-5-inch print fell from 50 cents for five-day service in 1970 to 20 cents for one-day service in 1984. The same principle applies to the processing of food. And since Olympic Foods will soon celebrate its 25th birthday, we can expect that our long experience will enable us to minimize costs and thus maximize profits.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nYour response:<br />\n<br />\nThe argument presented by Olympic Foods is logical in a certain extent. However, the argument is not persuasive enough. The company states that the costs of processing decrease as it improves its efficiency and way of doing things. It cites colour film processing as an example to help strengthen the argument. The company also believes that its experience will help minimize costs and maximize profits. Without further information, it is hard to validate these assumptions, leading to some logical flaws.<br />\n<br />\nThe first flaw is the false comparison with the colour film processing. The argument compares the cost change of it with that of food processing. This is an inappropriate comparison as these two industries are completely different. The technology, products, knowledge etc. of each industry are not exactly the same. The success in one industry may not lead to another. The reduction in cost in color film processing may result from a new technology which isn&rsquo;t able to decrease the cost of food. There are other reasons to consider when it comes to cost reduction in processing of food: supply of ingredients, demand in the market, competition, and marketing strategies etc. Without further clarification, the comparison may not be true.<br />\n<br />\nThe second flaw is the assumption that the long experience will help Olympic Foods minimize costs and thus maximize profits. There is no evidence proving that the experience will help the company achieve these results directly. The experience may only indicate how long has the business run. The company can minimize their costs by adopting newer technology, renewing facilities which can improve productivity, negotiating with suppliers for a better deal on ingredients, and reducing slow-moving items to save warehouse costs etc. Furthermore, more experience may not contribute to more profits. There are various reasons that lead to increasing profits, such as rising sales of products, less intense competition, price increase and surge in exports etc. Without further evidence, the argument relies on assumption only instead of facts.<br />\n<br />\nWhile the argument makes some sense, it lacks a lot of information to validate it. Olympic Foods has to look into the real factors that influence costs and profits and conduct more research to support the assumptions it has made. Without them, the argument is only based on assumptions and it is difficult to judge whether the company can achieve the results it wants."},{"pid":"caab22cc830705c720c040bff9e1f7959a48d801","tid":1947249,"uid":69696,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-28T07:20:55.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/cook.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6f015c1e7f2d2faab04c803894e96e56552ab924","tid":1947249,"uid":69696,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-28T08:25:20.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"26161d82bbb3754174b4328fbdce90a66e2ac345","tid":1947249,"uid":281775,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-28T09:36:41.000Z","msg":"Actually the whole argument is very loose.
