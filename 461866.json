More often, it&rsquo;s a deleterious faux pas by manufacturers out of touch with user demands.<br />\n<br />\nI&rsquo;ve been regurgitating that wisdom to friends, family, and the internet ever since the first Android skin appeared in the form of HTC Sense way back in 2009. But 8 years later, I&rsquo;m not so sure.<br />\n<br />\nFaster hardware and diminishing returns<br />\n<br />\nThe traditional arguments against skins and manufacturer tweaks are plenty. To list a few:<br />\n<br />\nSkins are uglier than Stock Android<br />\nThey add unnecessary bloatware or duplicate apps<br />\nThey slow down your phone<br />\nThey are inconsistent with Material Design in apps<br />\nThey get updated more slowly<br />\nThey make Android more confusing<br />\nThey drain battery<br />\nUntil the last year or two, I would agree with pretty much all these points. But as devices become more powerful and manufacturers get better at optimization, it&rsquo;s started to feel like my assumptions were more techno-prejudice than informed opinion.<br />\n<br />\nStock Android devices are generally guaranteed to be zippy, but ever-more-powerful hardware means the differences become less noticeable with every generation."},{"pid":"eaa5c4e7cf5e1f99058f97f27e672cc38cd75f18","tid":461866,"uid":5846,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-08T04:36:16.000Z","msg":"Three or four years ago, it was pretty much impossible to find an Android phone that performed as smoothly as a Nexus device. But when I reviewed the Huawei Mate 9, which is about as far from stock Android as it gets, I was surprised to find performance as buttery as any device I&rsquo;ve used &ndash; and moreover, that it&rsquo;s held up over the months.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLG V20 and Huawei Mate 9, left to right<br />\nSamsung, whose TouchWiz UI was endlessly maligned, improved dramatically with it&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Samsung Experience&rdquo; on the S8. Three months later, I&rsquo;ve not experienced the huge slowdowns Samsung devices were known to succumb to after being loaded with apps. Maybe it&rsquo;s not perfectly smooth, the way a Nexus or Pixel may be after extended use, but any slowdown is small enough that I don&rsquo;t care.<br />\n<br />\nStock Android doesn&rsquo;t even guarantee faster updates. I&rsquo;ve seen a weak correlation between skins and update frequency, especially in the US.<br />\n<br />\nMotorola, which has long used a nearly pristine version of Android, has occasionally been slow to issue security updates, lagging behind Samsung and LG. In the US, this is compounded by the fact that updates are usually pushed out by carriers, not manufacturers. And carriers are slow as molasses.<br />\n<br />\nOnePlus, which has a stock-ish UI, used to be slow to updates, but has sped up significantly in the past year. Samsung, despite its extensive skinning, is normally pretty fast about security patches and provides beta updates for it&rsquo;s major releases.<br />\n<br />\nSkins bring genuinely useful, unique features<br />\n<br />\nMost manufacturer skins are meant to provide new features to differentiate themselves from the competition, oftentimes things that can&rsquo;t be added through an app. I&rsquo;ve come to find some of these invaluable.<br />\n<br />\nAs much as Android users like to flaunt its flexibility over iOS, there are still plenty of things you can&rsquo;t add without root access, that manufacturers need to bake in. Some examples of things I can&rsquo;t do with stock Android:<br />\n<br />\nUse a one-handed mode that shrinks the display<br />\nRearrange, resize, or hide the navigation bar<br />\nAssign extra functions/gestures to navigation buttons<br />\nChange color themes, including a dark mode<br />\nAdd an icon pack<br />\nChange fonts<br />\nUse an always-on display<br />\nChange resolution or performance modes<br />\nActivate a reading mode<br />\nUse floating windows<br />\n<br />\nI use the one-handed mode on the S8 all the time<br />\nOther times, there are things I can add via apps, but either don&rsquo;t work as seamlessly, or I would&rsquo;ve never considered were they not baked-in features. Huawei&rsquo;s screen recording or Samsung&rsquo;s extra long screenshots come to mind, but there are a myriad of others.<br />\n<br />\nStock Android isn&rsquo;t Google&rsquo;s ideal any more<br />\n<br />\nAll this is confounded by the fact that in a sense, stock Android doesn&rsquo;t really exist anymore.<br />\n<br />\nNexus devices used to be Google&rsquo;s vision of what the best, purest version of Android looked like. They were a barebones baseline manufacturers could branch out from and add features as needed. They were never really meant to make money.<br />\n<br />\nThe Google Pixel is different. It commands a premium price tag, and in order to actually sell devices, Google needed to give you a reason to choose it over the competition. So Google started adding exclusive features, breaking away from Nexus tradition."},{"pid":"258b4aa56bcceb525b47adfbbe9e7d03345bf225","tid":461866,"uid":5846,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-08T04:37:17.000Z","msg":"Pure android 不=android 原來真係無錯<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c0dbce451c871e17a7d105bf9745fd28dc0fe8b5","tid":461866,"uid":81397,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-08T04:40:33.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>Pure android 不=android 原來真係無錯<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"cb781e4d25afdd1e98c0ad4a537c6e41e6d5d1b2","tid":461866,"uid":30006,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-08T05:01:09.000Z","msg":"Samsung, whose TouchWiz UI was endlessly maligned, improved dramatically with it&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Samsung Experience&rdquo; on the S8.
