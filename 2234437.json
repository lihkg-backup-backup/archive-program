We announce that we would cut all ties with them. What David has done in the past has damaged the reputation of the movement and those supporting him have been pouring fuel on the fire. David has committed many sins, so many that we cannot mention all of it as it will take too long.<br />\nHere's a quick recap of important ones:<br />\n1. Play with coca-cola in front of the memorial of Chow Tze Lok to trigger the cops with no respect to Chow so he could get attention.<br />\n2. Sent pictures of his dick to our female comrades.<br />\n3. Make the protest movement into one big joke by his so-called Performance Art and events.<br />\n4. Self proclaims himself as the &quot;best valiant&quot; and gave orders to other comrades.<br />\n5. Starting a personal cult by forming the &quot;David's stardom protest squad&quot;<br />\n6. Collaborated with the Hong Kong Popo to remove his opponents/opposition.<br />\n7. Dictatorship in his telegram channel and Instagram, anyone opposing him or giving him opinions to improve would be shamed as paid actors and an immediate ban. The peak of banning 300 people a day. This is in no means a way to fight for freedom.<br />\n8. Blocking a prison car outside of court, causing everyone to be removed from the scene and made the families of a protester to miss the chance to give him a farewell.<br />\n9. Refusing to listen to advice, everyone who gave him advice is being ignored<br />\n   His actions are in no way representing the movement. He is just using the movement as a tool to make himself famous. He and his supporters are no longer our comrades when he decided to collaborate with the Hong Kong Popo to remove one of our comrades who criticized him publicly, with the supporters supporting this action. They have chosen to be dogs of the regime when he decides to forgive and collaborate with the Popo and to give them respect, which they don't deserve. Being yellow is no excuse for his wrongdoings.<br />\n  We are not making someone stupid famous, he is famous for being stupid already.<br />\n  Sincerely, fuck you, from the bottom of our hearts.<br />\n<br />\n香港軍事台 : @HKMilitary<br />\n<br />\n其他參與割蓆頻道（排名不分先後）<br />\n和你養 @woneihelp<br />\n港島西 @Islandwest84<br />\n香港歷史台 @HKHistory<br />\n海市蜃樓 @themirageagency<br />\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />\n加名 @HKMilbot"},{"pid":"9cde0ac3cdbd87016c4dd4249b13c3cd83eff501","tid":2234437,"uid":173814,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-08T02:10:34.000Z","msg":"是撚但啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4ad4bf65aabfa3de5eda9127ed758f3eca683b24","tid":2234437,"uid":247211,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-08T02:10:40.000Z","msg":"我地已經冇分化既本錢<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/dying.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wail.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6fb13f0ca662fb71bef193b088177585078da79c","tid":2234437,"uid":115579,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-08T02:25:36.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />又係軍事台 是但啦<br />\n日日lunch gor, 推聯署又唔撚見佢咁上心"},{"pid":"ccc0410f7a58c6396cb8e6bd001ad3d1c2196e38","tid":2234437,"uid":310461,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"4ad4bf65aabfa3de5eda9127ed758f3eca683b24","tid":2234437,"uid":247211,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-08T02:10:40.000Z","msg":"我地已經冇分化既本錢<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/dying.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wail.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-08T02:29:29.000Z","msg":"sigh......"}]}
