I had my personal training session at the gym yesterday and was soaking wet. Then I soaked in a jacuzzi. The gym is situated beside the jacuzzi where you can see the inside of the gym clearly. I saw a slim guy lift a three pound dumbbell for all he was worth but still couldn't complete the exercise lol. I enjoy hitting the gym and I know my personal trainer is worth her salt as I'm making good progress with my physique. She's a vivacious, in-your-face woman who's sometimes too honest for her own good. I dislike going to Physical because the salespeople are way too in-your-face. I'm a fan of Vince Carter. He was certainly a very exciting slam dunker who was worth his weight in gold to Raptors. Don't get me wrong- I still enjoy watching him play even though he's past his prime. He proved his worth to Raptors by helping win multiple championships. His worth to the team was incalculable. I must say he's made significant progress with his three point shooting since he joined Nets. Unfortunately his leg injury has progressed fairly rapidly causing him to be sidelined for five months through injury. He complained that taking a five-month hiatus is too long but it's for his own safety. He has a follow-up to the doctor next week. His friend LeBron James will also be out of commission until his back heals. He's made slow but steady progress with his shooting since he injured his back. His doctor said he was making good progress and will check on his progress next month. He assigned the blame for his injury to a lack of training and stretching. Oh well it could be worse. His worth of contribution to Lakers is incalculable. Lakers is as likely to beat Warriors as Cavaliers in my opinion. Recently Lakers didn't just beat Bulls. They wiped the floor with them. Lebron said to Bulls &quot;In your face!&quot; the moment they beat Bulls. Bulls lost its edge to a certain extent after their point leaders left the team. The other month Raptors edged out Bulls by three points which reminds me of Warriors edging out Cavaliers by five points. The responsibilities of every coach in every team are well defined. Everyone has a vital role to play in every team. in addition the government has appointed a commission to examine the use of steroids among players. Another commission has also been established to investigate family violence in nba which I wholeheartedly support. By the way my friend John's brother has opened a beauty parlour. Hopefully it attracts lots of customers since he bet the ranch on it. His uncle was broke several years ago as he bet the farm on his company which went bankrupt later. He managed to honour his debts in four years. His best friend is his poodle. He towels the dog off after its bath. Today dogs certainly don't come cheap including getting them spayed or neutered and any medications they take when they have a condition. I've read in the newspapers that some customers were promised to get their money back if they weren't happy with the products but later they found out they'd been sold down the river as they have been unable to contact the scammer to date. The swindler didn't honour the contracts. John's great granddad was commissioned as a senior officer in the army. He was buried with full military honours."},{"pid":"528f998974002ec257319488f7c4178ba92d7570","tid":1644075,"uid":80503,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"ccfd12c903db94210e9b07a61f11b62302fda465","tid":1644075,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-22T08:07:17.000Z","msg":"I recommend Anytime Fitness and Go-Ji Fitness.
