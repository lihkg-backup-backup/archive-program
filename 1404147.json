The SAR government has decided to neglect the public opinion, making thousands of our brave citizens voluntarily take the fight to the street, youths risking their lives for the cause and at least six citizens decide to pay the ultimate price for it. The Hong Kong SAR government as a body of public servants, are supposed to serve the citizens, but they did not, which is fundamentally immoral. Regrettably the regime did not stop here. They mobilised the foul-mouthed, manipulative constables onto political missions, purposely hide the crimes themselves have committed. Moreover, they orchestrated a terrorist plot against civilians with LOCPG and the triads in Yuen Long. The liaison between Hong Kong SAR government, Chinese government, the Police and Triads have shown they have zero remorse and an absolute disgrace.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe are a group of security officers from all over Hong Kong. It might not be our duty to confront or investigate crime, but we are here to also serve and protect our people. If there is anyone among us plotting any crimes, there is no ground whatsoever to resume trust on them. Now the Hong Kong Police have realised the plot, but not only responding queries in an appalling manner, but allowing the attacks to happen by shutting the gates of the police stations. We as people who also provide security services, are ashamed by all these horrific actions."},{"pid":"dfece9cf2f034f1815fcff949c8273a3f5b83123","tid":1404147,"uid":203846,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-04T02:59:56.000Z","msg":"The society have been calling on a full withdrawal of the extradition law amendment bill, however the Hong Kong SAR Government &nbsp;considers such sincere appeal nonsense. Instead of comforting the society from political arguments, they were spotted attending to luxury balls and luncheons, enjoying their wine and food, meanwhile millions of citizens were taking up the heat, fighting for our freedom and future. Over the 22 years of SAR rule, the Hong Kong SAR government have been nothing but a puppet to Beijing while the undemocratic legislature have also failed to do its duty to monitor the failing government. The prosperity of Hong Kong would have been long gone if not we, the citizen are committed to our duties.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nNow we stand with people, to send an ultimatum to the SAR government:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n1. Retract the extradition law amendment bill.<br />\n<br />\n2. Establish an independent inquiry with broad regconition.<br />\n<br />\n3. Release political prisoners and stop purging political dissidents.<br />\n<br />\n4. Retract the label of riot.<br />\n<br />\n5. Full democracy now.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe will go on strike on the 5th of August, this serves as a notice."},{"pid":"2eb5a282d9c79a4ce7ed78b530e824ad5326a138","tid":1404147,"uid":203846,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-04T03:01:28.000Z","msg":"自推一下"},{"pid":"99dd4abd6c07daa407cc071d8fa82a7701988b41","tid":1404147,"uid":203846,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-04T03:02:33.000Z","msg":"全民罷工"},{"pid":"128fc99b2a6abc2b3ac19e33b709682fc86aecc0","tid":1404147,"uid":180661,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-04T03:03:06.000Z","msg":"推！"},{"pid":"f60ce768f83a995cb2e1fa46a2987b46dcba2f8a","tid":1404147,"uid":203846,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-04T03:04:02.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"92a44860b6812e5b1f8c6fbcf7ec604878547a81","tid":1404147,"uid":203846,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-04T03:20:53.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"4d8efc75f2af753de4d1cf533be2e25871dbddd5","tid":1404147,"uid":34007,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-04T03:28:11.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5d43a025ec08aa15e44858d8bdc3d8c3951a4079","tid":1404147,"uid":215715,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-04T03:43:29.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"bfe8b43c5e1bd35a8111c4fd7312e99c597c2fed","tid":1404147,"uid":26445,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-04T03:49:16.000Z","msg":"PM 工程部表示波已射<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"28540898f5050cc670fee4ae5bd7763d562ef5db","tid":1404147,"uid":258159,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-04T04:49:32.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"d70d212b2b9db5d5f406c0e35f62d48eb06ee25e","tid":1404147,"uid":203846,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-04T06:05:44.000Z","msg":"推"}]}
