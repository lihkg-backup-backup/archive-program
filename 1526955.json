If the BNO holders lose this chance to fight for equality, we will never have another chance in history,&rdquo; said Craig Choy, spokesman for campaign group Equal Rights for British National Overseas.</span></strong><br />\n<br />\nThe demands, <span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">which have won some support in Westminster</span></strong></span>, follow escalating street protests in the territory sparked by a controversial bill that would allow Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.<br />\n<br />\nThe demonstrations have morphed into broader calls for democracy and have sparked growing fears of direct intervention in the territory by Beijing, leading more Hong Kong residents to look for alternatives countries in which to live.<br />\n<br />\nThe number of people in Hong Kong looking to secure residency overseas gathered pace in June, with migration consultants reporting a surge in inquiries.<br />\n<br />\nApplications for Certificates of No Criminal Conviction from the Hong Kong police, often a requirement for overseas residency applications, jumped 30 per cent year on year for the period corresponding with the protests between June and August 27.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Hong Kong is no longer safe for us with eroding human rights,&rdquo; said one of the petition organisers who goes by the name Sapphire. &ldquo;We are born British, the fact that China forced their nationality on us without our consent does not change the fact that we are British.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong><ins>Tom Tugendhat, a conservative MP and chairman of the UK House of Commons&rsquo; foreign affairs committee, said he had won support from &ldquo;a few&rdquo; cabinet ministers for a proposal to grant BNO holders full UK citizenship.<br />\n</ins></strong></span><br />\n<strong>已經有幾個英國內閣成員支持</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">&ldquo;The idea is to give people the confidence to stay [in Hong Kong] knowing that they don&rsquo;t need to make a decision now,&rdquo; Mr Tugendhat said.</span></strong><br />\n<br />\nMr Choy, from Equal Rights for British National Overseas, said people in Hong Kong felt increasingly desperate and viewed the protests as an &ldquo;endgame&rdquo;. Upgrading the rights of BNO passport holders, or expanding visa programmes for young people, would help calm the situation, he said.<br />\n<br />\nA UK government spokesman said the best solution for Hong Kong and BNO holders was the &ldquo;full respect for the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Sino-British Joint Declaration&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nDominic Raab, UK foreign secretary, earlier this month urged Hong Kong&rsquo;s chief executive Carrie Lam to engage in a dialogue with protesters and emphasised the right to peaceful protest. In response, Beijing told the UK to stop interfering in China&rsquo;s internal affairs.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong residents who registered for British National (Overseas) status before the handover of the territory from the UK to China in 1997 have the right to consular assistance but they are not British citizens and do not have the automatic right to live or work in the UK.<br />\n<br />\nElspeth Guild, a law professor at Queen Mary University of London, said any BNO holders in the UK who might be at risk on their return to the territory should be granted an extension of stay by the Home Office. It would be &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; if the UK tried to deport them back to Hong Kong &ldquo;where there is a risk that they would be persecuted&rdquo;, she said."},{"pid":"f0e74617ba26dfb1f12bd35fe40f6cc5dfb5bddf","tid":1526955,"uid":287362,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-01T08:15:03.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"a473a57c6bf2ad8bd4e6a2f1983aa76db267ac95","tid":1526955,"uid":287362,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-01T08:15:20.000Z","msg":"<img

ramp up a campaign to receive full UK citizenship to secure an avenue of escape from the territory.<br />\n<br />\nAbout 300 activists on Sunday petitioned the British consulate to demand they receive a full UK passport in place of their &ldquo;second-class&rdquo; British National (Overseas) passports, a document issued to Hong Kong residents born before the handover of the territory from UK to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>About 170,000 people hold valid BNO passports, according to figures from the UK&rsquo;s Home Office, but the document awards few of the entitlements of full citizenship, such as the right of abode in the UK.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">&ldquo;We think this is now or never. If the BNO holders lose this chance to fight for equality, we will never have another chance in history,&rdquo; said Craig Choy, spokesman for campaign group Equal Rights for British National Overseas.</span></strong><br />\n<br />\nThe demands, <span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">which have won some support in Westminster</span></strong></span>, follow escalating street protests in the territory sparked by a controversial bill that would allow Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.<br />\n<br />\nThe demonstrations have morphed into broader calls for democracy and have sparked growing fears of direct intervention in the territory by Beijing, leading more Hong Kong residents to look for alternatives countries in which to live.<br />\n<br />\nThe number of people in Hong Kong looking to secure residency overseas gathered pace in June, with migration consultants reporting a surge in inquiries.<br />\n<br />\nApplications for Certificates of No Criminal Conviction from the Hong Kong police, often a requirement for overseas residency applications, jumped 30 per cent year on year for the period corresponding with the protests between June and August 27.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Hong Kong is no longer safe for us with eroding human rights,&rdquo; said one of the petition organisers who goes by the name Sapphire. &ldquo;We are born British, the fact that China forced their nationality on us without our consent does not change the fact that we are British.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong><ins>Tom Tugendhat, a conservative MP and chairman of the UK House of Commons&rsquo; foreign affairs committee, said he had won support from &ldquo;a few&rdquo; cabinet ministers for a proposal to grant BNO holders full UK citizenship.<br />\n</ins></strong></span><br />\n<strong>已經有幾個英國內閣成員支持</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">&ldquo;The idea is to give people the confidence to stay [in Hong Kong] knowing that they don&rsquo;t need to make a decision now,&rdquo; Mr Tugendhat said.</span></strong><br />\n<br />\nMr Choy, from Equal Rights for British National Overseas, said people in Hong Kong felt increasingly desperate and viewed the protests as an &ldquo;endgame&rdquo;. Upgrading the rights of BNO passport holders, or expanding visa programmes for young people, would help calm the situation, he said.<br />\n<br />\nA UK government spokesman said the best solution for Hong Kong and BNO holders was the &ldquo;full respect for the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Sino-British Joint Declaration&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nDominic Raab, UK foreign secretary, earlier this month urged Hong Kong&rsquo;s chief executive Carrie Lam to engage in a dialogue with protesters and emphasised the right to peaceful protest. In response, Beijing told the UK to stop interfering in China&rsquo;s internal affairs.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong residents who registered for British National (Overseas) status before the handover of the territory from the UK to China in 1997 have the right to consular assistance but they are not British citizens and do not have the automatic right to live or work in the UK.<br />\n<br />\nElspeth Guild, a law professor at Queen Mary University of London, said any BNO holders in the UK who might be at risk on their return to the territory should be granted an extension of stay by the Home Office. It would be &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; if the UK tried to deport them back to Hong Kong &ldquo;where there is a risk that they would be persecuted&rdquo;, she said."},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-02T11:17:08.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"845910ba4f5209dd1c404b80327752bdd960076f","tid":1526955,"uid":229886,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"962ac4a1f7bd487331ef4db5d62c9264bb19e4e7","tid":1526955,"uid":28831,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"quote":{"pid":"4750f9e51351ee2b30d34ea7b0a3902dbbf46555","tid":1526955,"uid":264299,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"8703b8cd3ba9ff7d644f1c75d247bc248e502c5b","tid":1526955,"uid":52271,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-02T06:28:51.000Z","msg":"如果佢一路做好佢個角色就唔會搞到咁啦<br />\n人地奶共奶到風生水起，佢奶極都仲日落"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-02T06:42:46.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />有美帝大佬唔跟走去奶共，抵日落"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-02T11:01:48.000Z","msg":"呢個國家真係好撚廢<br />\n屌點解當年我地會比呢班友統治架<br />\n如果當年係美帝殖民我地而家香港應該世界第一"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-02T11:17:43.000Z","msg":"你渣gtr死左啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"017978a8dfa3a8d0edd921e57a89a5dec794c35b","tid":1526955,"uid":52090,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-02T11:19:57.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7a62df4cb4f0a1dfb0fd071976bad39718b63acd","tid":1526955,"uid":61228,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-02T11:22:20.000Z","msg":"以前唔覺而家覺，英國佬好撚冇擔"},{"pid":"b680a24eefae979feab6bb7a03a1a4cf10da3099","tid":1526955,"uid":16458,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-02T11:47:14.000Z","msg":"push"}]}
