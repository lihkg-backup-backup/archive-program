Australians and Singaporeans are exempt because of free-trade deals.<br />\n<br />\nNew Zealand is facing a housing affordability crisis which has left home ownership out of reach for many.<br />\n<br />\nLow interest rates, limited housing stock and immigration have driven up prices in recent years.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Is it a total ban?</span><br />\n<br />\nNo, only non-residents are affected by the Overseas Investment Amendment Bill, which was passed in a 63-57 vote on Wednesday.<br />\n<br />\nThey are now banned from purchasing most types of homes - but they will be able to make limited investments in new apartments in large developments.<br />\n<br />\nForeigners with residency status in New Zealand - as well as non-resident Australian and Singaporean nationals - are not affected by the ban.<br />\n<br />\nNew Zealand's Trade and Economic Development Minister David Parker described the passage of the bill as a &quot;significant milestone&quot;.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;This government believes that New Zealanders should not be outbid by wealthier foreign buyers,&quot; he said.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Whether it's a beautiful lakeside or ocean-front estate, or a modest suburban house, this law ensures that the market for our homes is set in New Zealand, not on the international market.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nBut opponents said the ban was unnecessary and would not fix any problem.<br />\n<br />\nForeign ownership and a housing shortage in New Zealand's bigger cities were prominent issues in the run-up to last year's election, which saw the end of nine years of rule by the conservative National Party.<br />\n<br />\nNew Zealand now has a centre-left coalition government led by Labour's Jacinda Ardern, the country's youngest female leader.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">What's the bigger picture?</span><br />\n<br />\nThe ban follows fears that overseas buyers of homes were putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices.<br />\n<br />\nChinese investors have been among the biggest and most active offshore buyers of property in the New Zealand market.<br />\n<br />\nAlso, some wealthy Americans - like Silicon Valley tech billionaire Peter Thiel - have become New Zealand citizens or have bought property in the country.<br />\n<br />\nAverage prices in New Zealand have risen more than 60% in the past 10 years, while in Auckland - the country's largest city - they have almost doubled.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, the housing market has somewhat cooled in recent months.<br />\n<br />\nIn July, the median price for residential property nationwide was NZ$550,000 ($360,500; &pound;284,000), according to data from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand.<br />\n<br />\nIn June, about 82% of houses were bought by New Zealand's citizens or residents, with fewer than 3% of homes going to foreigners.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45199034\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-asia-45199034&d=n7b5hiLJR3Pc%2Fa7pv3ssoDM0pwszV1jUpWwTgNsMWwc%3D&h=d31b7150\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-asia-45199034&h=f93cd050\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45199034</a>"},{"pid":"85a37d36e440bcbaa7a455cefbdf807c3e1af13e","tid":782058,"uid":153689,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-08-16T13:10:03.000Z","msg":"依家係咪冇人叫New Zealand做紐西蘭？"},{"pid":"9539778ea522ef70956f98726ae1e80520b02228","tid":782058,"uid":42767,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-08-16T14:18:30.000Z","msg":"Foreigners with residency status in New Zealand -
