Dream Cruise is out of commission by broken components and power failures andeobt be in commission until September. Costa Cruise, which is also out of commission for repairs, is expected to be back in commission in November. Oh well. By the way, I want to match my pink shirt to a pair of beige chinos. Pink matches up with beige and khaki. Pink matches black and white too. It also goes with sky blue and navy blue. Unfortunately Zara in Shinjuku is undergoing refurbishment. Apparently it's being retrofitted with new clothes racks, shelves and updated door jambs. Oh well, I suppose I can go to another branch tomorrow. Anyway, it's time to get my beauty sleep. My girlfriend has tumbled into her duvet and got some of her beauty sleep. Goodnight, sleep well !"}]}
