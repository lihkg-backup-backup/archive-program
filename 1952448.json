I just copied a small, 23-line script and added it to my site&rsquo;s header  which would be a simple task for any web developer  and the tracking worked immediately. With almost no development or coding experience, I was able to see what every single visitor to my site did.<br />\n<br />\nIn an incognito window, I opened my site and browsed around for a minute. When I came back to my FullStory dashboard, I found a video recreation of every single movement I&rsquo;d just made waiting for me. I expected the video to show the links I clicked on, and maybe text I highlighted. What surprised me was that the software even recorded when I shook my mouse around while deciding what to click on. It felt like observing digital body language. FullStory even has a feature that tracks what it calls &ldquo;rage clicks.&rdquo; This is when a user gets frustrated with a site and starts angrily clicking over and over.<br />\nBeyond the replay, FullStory and services like it provide sites with analytics reports on aggregate user behavior and heat maps that show where users have clicked.<br />\n<br />\nReplay services offer tools to selectively exclude or hide information from the third parties they partner with, such as content entered into boxes for passwords or credit card information.

After you restarted Tor Browser or pressed New Identity, forbidding any zero-day vulnerabilities, all opened tabs will be closed, and you should have a new Tor Circuit and with all browsing history, cookies and other user configurations removed. &ldquo;New Tor Circuit for this Site&rdquo; will not remove cookies or change your identity as observed by the website. This is useful if some websites geo-blocked the country wherein the exit node resided.<br />\n<br />\nEven if you connect to two different sites that use the same third-party tracking service / CDN (Content Delivery Network (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network#Security_and_privacy\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FContent_delivery_network%23Security_and_privacy&d=J1zZABjvT6n5gtW5jiJIhlA4V8ywhhxRXFDRWvztIyc%3D&h=adde1363\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network#Security_and_privacy</a>), Tor Browser will force the content to be served over two different Tor circuits, so the tracker will not know that both connections originate from your browser.<br />\n<br />\nOn the other hand, all connections to a single website address will be made over the same Tor circuit, meaning you can browse different pages of a single website in separate tabs or windows without getting logged out.<br />\n<br />\nTor建議用家不要更改任何Tor Browser裏的設定，除了Security Settings。Increasing Tor Browser's security level will stop some web pages from functioning properly, so you should weigh your security needs against the degree of usability you require.<br />\n<br />\nSafer disables website features like JavaScript on all non-HTTPS sites (which you should not be browsing anyway, if you must view HTTP sites, please go to https://web[.]<a href=\"http://archive.org/save/[put\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Farchive.org%2Fsave%2F%5Bput&d=J1zZABjvT6n5gtW5jiJIhlA4V8ywhhxRXFDRWvztIyc%3D&h=f243ed44\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">archive.org/save/[put</a> HTTP link here]); some fonts and math symbols are disabled; audio and video (HTML5 media) are click-to-play.<br />\n<br />\nSafest disables JavaScript by default on all sites; some fonts, icons, math symbols, and images are disabled; audio and video (HTML5 media) are click-to-play.

Potentially dangerous things such as the JIT compiler and SVG images are disabled.<br />\n<br />\n我建議您把它更改到Safer。Tor Browser裏的安全設定Safest 在所有網站都不允許JavaScript，因此如果您不是一個資深用家的話會使很多網站無法使用。不過以您嘅聰明才智，我諗您只需要試下用Safest mode，慢慢就會識用NoScript來whitelist網站。<br />\n<br />\n通常如果您去https[://]example[.]site, 如果那個網站無法載入，把first-party domain ([&hellip;].example[.]site) 更改成Temp Trusted應該就可以了。在Tor Browser裏面, 每一次重新啟動都會清除NoScript的whitelist，所以Trusted跟 Temp Trusted沒有分別。<br />\n每當這些字: &quot;ad&quot;, &quot;syndication&quot;, &quot;tag&quot;, &ldquo;analytics&rdquo;, &ldquo;doubleclick[.]com&rdquo;, &ldquo;facebook[.]net&rdquo;, 在NoScript出現，那些通常都是沒有用的trackers而setting them to UNTRUSTED通常不會有負面影響。<br />\n<br />\n請記住即使您使用了Tor而且不允許JavaScript，瀏覽器的視窗大小, 滑鼠/trackpad的動作，打字/手寫的patterns仍然可以用來辨析您的身份。安裝add-ons會破壞您的匿名性，因為那會改變您的browser fingerprint，一些add-ons甚至能繞過proxy 設定，因而完全繞過Tor。 所以 Tor Project 建議您不要加任何add-ons或變更任何設定，包括視窗大小。預設嘅視窗大小是1000x1000 pixels。但當不能做到時，它會變成最近的100x100倍數。放大或縮小、變更瀏覽器的視窗大小 、zoom-in 會改變瀏覽器的視窗大小，as determined by CSS. 最恐怖嘅係，CSS alone就足夠泄漏您的視窗大小，JavaScript 都唔使。所以即使您將 security settings 設至 Safest，如果您的視窗大小夠獨特，您也有可能會被deanonymized。  (<a href=\"https://matt.traudt.xyz/p/YF4ciVY6.html;\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmatt.traudt.xyz%2Fp%2FYF4ciVY6.html%3B&d=J1zZABjvT6n5gtW5jiJIhlA4V8ywhhxRXFDRWvztIyc%3D&h=16be3360\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://matt.traudt.xyz/p/YF4ciVY6.html;</a> <a href=\"https://demos.traudt.xyz/css/media/index.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdemos.traudt.xyz%2Fcss%2Fmedia%2Findex.html&d=J1zZABjvT6n5gtW5jiJIhlA4V8ywhhxRXFDRWvztIyc%3D&h=4fce952e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://demos.traudt.xyz/css/media/index.html</a>)"},{"pid":"c86c3cdacd94b4d43bb94929fb5923f5c281ed7f","tid":1952448,"uid":346260,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-31T15:17:33.000Z","msg":"How the Tor Network works:<br />\nIn addition to the aforementioned fingerprinting protection, the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB, or just Tor Browser) directs your browsing activities to 3個隨機選擇的nodes, which are operated by volunteers with the technical knowhow from across the globe. There are 7000 nodes at the time of writing (Feb 14, 2020). <br />\n<br />\nTor Browser forms a new Tor Circuit for every website you are browsing to protect your identity (however, do note that https[://]example[.]site shares the same Tor circuit as https[://]hi[.]example[.]site). Your browsing activities are symmetrically encrypted thrice as they reach the first of the 3 Tor nodes, called a Guard node or an Entry node, which will be responsible for serving your request. This Entry node 會「剝」開一層加密，透露your request的下個目的地。The second node knows nothing about you or what website you are browsing, 因為每一個node都只知道 the origin and destination of the browsing activities. Therefore 沒有一個 entity 可以同時知道您是誰 and 您瀏覽嘅網站。當最後一層加密被解密後，your request will exit the Tor network and will be sent to the website (hopefully HTTPS).

Even if you are not subjected to these sinister scenarios, VPNs do not offer first-party isolation (i.e. all your network requests are sent through the same server(s)), do not offer any fingerprinting protection, knows who you are and what websites you are browsing at the same time, and is only secure if you trust that they and the servers that they rent, and the companies administering the servers do not log and sell customer data. 好多 VPN 公司都係空殼公司，私底下在另一個有寬鬆私隱條例的國家運作; 一些公司聲稱他們的伺服器runs on RAM (such that沒有資料是被儲存多於幾秒), but they are unable to prove that 所有伺服器在所有時間都是咁樣運作的。最耐人尋味的是, 支国共慘党的 GFW能夠阻擋大部分 Tor 的 pluggable transports such as meek-azure (which are specially designed to prevent anyone monitoring the network to detect Tor traffic),  但支国共慘党竟然允許一些 single-point-of-failure 的VPN 不停運作，縱然它們能夠輕易被阻擋？ 班磚家仲要係二十四小時工作的。我非常有信心那些能在大劣淪陷區用到的 VPN 是 ʕᴥʔ曱維尼所設下嘅「冚鄭」, 係個陽謀, 遲下 (如果咁都唔支爆) 曱維尼就會將啲「密唐」一網打盡 。Please see this video for more information about VPNs: <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=6ohvf03NiIA\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6ohvf03NiIA&d=J1zZABjvT6n5gtW5jiJIhlA4V8ywhhxRXFDRWvztIyc%3D&h=66f79b59\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://youtube.com/watch?v=6ohvf03NiIA</a><br />\n<br />\n由個純理論嘅角度講 (attack個 protocol)，同時控制第一個 node和第三個 node (and/or controls/watches the website you visit, but if that is the case then you would be tracked 100% of the time if not using Tor) 是唯一可以聯繫到 Tor 用戶的互聯網活動的方法; 第一個 node 會幾個月不變，because if Tor selected new entry and exit relays each time you used the Tor network, the attacker will be able to correlate all traffic you send with probability around (c/n)^2. But profiling is, for most users, as bad as being traced all the time: they want to do something often without an attacker noticing, and the attacker noticing once is as bad as the attacker noticing more often. Thus, choosing many random entries and exits gives the user no chance of escaping profiling by this kind of attacker. With &quot;entry guards&quot;, each Tor client selects a few relays at random to use as entry points, and uses only those relays for her first hop. If those relays are not controlled or observed, the attacker will be unable to correlate users.

Thus, the user has some chance, on the order of (n-c)/n, of avoiding profiling, whereas she had none before."},{"pid":"b6c762bbe6cbc34fc4304e6867edefb865352538","tid":1952448,"uid":346260,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-31T15:18:01.000Z","msg":"Please see: <br />\n<a href=\"https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2F2019.www.torproject.org%2Fdocs%2Ffaq.html.en&d=J1zZABjvT6n5gtW5jiJIhlA4V8ywhhxRXFDRWvztIyc%3D&h=1bc8256a\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://robertheaton.com/2019/04/06/how-does-tor-work/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Frobertheaton.com%2F2019%2F04%2F06%2Fhow-does-tor-work%2F&d=J1zZABjvT6n5gtW5jiJIhlA4V8ywhhxRXFDRWvztIyc%3D&h=98838e2a\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://robertheaton.com/2019/04/06/how-does-tor-work/</a> (Note that this guide is not entirely correct.

Wherever possible, I recommend you avoid apps that only offer marginal convenience gains such as weather apps and the YouTube app. A simple Startpage search (basically uses Google searches but without any manipulation / censorship of search data based on what Google wants you to see / anticipates you would like to see, accessible at <a href=\"https://startpage.com\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstartpage.com&d=J1zZABjvT6n5gtW5jiJIhlA4V8ywhhxRXFDRWvztIyc%3D&h=66d0f7c2\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://startpage.com</a>) would yield you the weather forecast anyway, and YouTube as accessed through the Tor Browser prevents Google from tracking you, and has the added benefit of avoiding Google from putting you in an echo chamber.<br />\n<br />\n iii.

Do bear in mind that it will be using your IP address instead of that of the Tor exit node&rsquo;s regardless of what settings you made outside of Work Profile; using Work Profile is beneficial as you will not have to turn off Block connections without VPN, which would also enable internet access for all apps (Those that remain unticked in Tor-Enabled Apps could then transmit data that is not through Tor).<br />\n <br />\nAlternatively, if you have a phone that runs Android 10, I recommend you disable Internet for individual apps that do not need connection at all times and are not banking apps in the phone Settings, but include them in Tor-Enabled Apps.
