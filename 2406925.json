It is easy to imagine the backlash should disgruntled migrants arrive in already-stretched communities.  <br />\n<br />\nMigration from Eastern Europe undoubtedly impacted British politics, contributing to the growth of Euroscepticism and the subsequent vote to leave the European Union.<br />\n<br />\nWhile the benefits of the migration of Hong Kongers  to the UK are extraordinary, experience clearly demonstrates the risks should we fail to learn from the recent past."},{"pid":"f8fb3456e3bb823b9736cb43b09507cbb43b9ac2","tid":2406925,"uid":48083,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-13T14:56:17.000Z","msg":"A cross-departmental Task Force should be established, charged with overseeing preparations.<br />\n<br />\nChaired and overseen by a responsible Minister, this taskforce should include representatives of devolved and local government.
