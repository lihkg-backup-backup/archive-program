We have marched and rallied. Some of us have risked our safety and future to storm into the Hong Kong Legislative Council.  Some of us have even lost our lives willingly just in hope of waking up those in power. But all of these fell to deaf ears.

We therefore sincerely urge the government to stop leading us astray and bring us back to the path of building a united, democratic, free and just society."},{"pid":"6d6b6ae57a7bb41c1b00e4b87ad52cdd71261694","tid":1336577,"uid":14997,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-21T04:31:52.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"a4f22293d7e52311d2850ec98389769bf3efa483","tid":1336577,"uid":14997,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-21T04:32:02.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c45bda755ff3eaf9ac4db470857e20e06a224cf0","tid":1336577,"uid":14997,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-21T04:32:47.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"36de8d0107f1db7f8de6efe581716c6cbde32647","tid":1336577,"uid":14997,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-21T04:32:58.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8e0a61d43d7f02bad9df11b1cb3200a333cff5a0","tid":1336577,"uid":14997,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-21T04:34:51.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"ad9e44a9d587addce732ea9155c5e71d678a9239","tid":1336577,"uid":14997,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-21T04:35:01.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"29de600dffce9a03b05be653140f9137865403e9","tid":1336577,"uid":14997,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-21T04:35:52.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"2af92a10a730321762534735a6c64c842b635f0e","tid":1336577,"uid":14997,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-21T04:37:42.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"c6725c857db5eb7e5863d59ea5ce0915c923f69d","tid":1336577,"uid":266079,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"fc198a674f0ad8d544d30beb828bbd911209826d","tid":1336577,"uid":14997,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-21T04:31:39.000Z","msg":"Dear Hongkongers and friends of Hong Kong around the world:<br />\n<br />\nWe are a group of Hongkongers who love our city dearly.
