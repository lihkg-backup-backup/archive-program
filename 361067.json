If it does &mdash; and it looks likely &mdash; the event will be a watershed in Hong Kong&rsquo;s modern history and should set off further alarms about China&rsquo;s intentions for the territory.<br />\n<br />\nJoshua Wong, one of the three young men bracing for this verdict, has been a hero of his hometown&rsquo;s democracy movement since he was 14 years old. He&rsquo;s still too young to buy a beer in the United States. The pinnacle of Mr. Wong&rsquo;s activism came during 2014, when he and a group of students led hundreds of thousands of their neighbors in an extraordinary 79-day demonstration defending Hong Kong&rsquo;s autonomy from Beijing&rsquo;s increasing encroachment. The protest, known as the Umbrella Movement, named for its protection against the elements and police pepper spray, was one of the largest in the city&rsquo;s history.<br />\n<br />\nThree years later, Mr. Wong and his colleagues, including Nathan Law and Alex Chow, are still being punished for their courage. Several are under threat of bankruptcy thanks to onerous legal fees, and others are being stymied in their chosen fields because of their criticism of the Communist Party. But what is by far most troubling is the prospect that Mr. Wong, Mr. Law and Mr. Chow might be thrown in prison this week on charges for which they have already served sentences.<br />\n<br />\nLast year, the three were found guilty of &ldquo;unlawful assembly&rdquo; for entering a fenced-off area outside the city&rsquo;s government headquarters during the Umbrella Movement protests. Mr. Wong and Mr. Law were sentenced to community service; Mr. Chow was given a three-week suspended sentence. The charge &mdash; not to mention the verdict &mdash; was yet another sign that Beijing had little intention to honor its commitment to free speech and peaceful assembly.<br />\n<br />\nNow Hong Kong&rsquo;s Department of Justice has reopened the case on the specious grounds that their punishment was too lenient. If they are sentenced to more than three months &mdash; their lawyers say that&rsquo;s highly plausible &mdash; they would be barred from running for political office for five years.<br />\n<br />\nThis episode is of a piece with the increasingly brazen crackdown against anyone in the city who challenges Beijing&rsquo;s control. Last week Howard Lam, a liberal member of the city&rsquo;s Democratic Party, says he was snatched off the street by two men. He said they asked whether he was a Christian, then one said, I&rsquo;ll &ldquo;give you some crosses.&rdquo; Mr. Lam later showed journalists rows of tiny crosses that had been stapled into his thighs. In July, four pro-democracy lawmakers, including Mr. Law, were dismissed from Hong Kong&rsquo;s Legislative Council on the bogus ground that their oaths were improper.<br />\n<br />\nWhen Britain handed authority for Hong Kong back to Beijing 20 years ago, there was hope that the Western-style freedoms of this former colony would gradually influence the authoritarian mainland. But the opposite is proving true. Hong Kong&rsquo;s courts, once celebrated for their independence, are under pressure to become tools of the Chinese Communist Party. The promise of &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; is giving way to the reality of one country, one system."},{"pid":"932bb61d6219a7f07a780996fca0eb5fd6548d7c","tid":361067,"uid":47714,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-15T19:59:43.000Z","msg":"When Britain handed authority for Hong Kong back to Beijing 20 years ago, there was hope that the Western-style freedoms of this former colony would gradually influence the authoritarian mainland.

The promise of &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; is giving way to the reality of one country, one system.<br />\n<br />\nOn a visit to New York this month with his longtime colleague Derek Lam, Mr. Wong was asked if he was scared about the likelihood of going to prison.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;My parents named me after Joshua because they hoped I would be like Joshua in the Bible,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;To lead people to make change and to ask for social justice.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;As a person in the global spotlight,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I bear more responsibility to let the world know that Hong Kong people will still keep fighting.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nWe don&rsquo;t doubt they will. The question is whether the United States, Britain and other nations will back up these young democrats who insist that their hometown maintain its commitments to the rule of law and political freedom."},{"pid":"3bf2b2902d23f8ea31120ba48c4eee795d9a583e","tid":361067,"uid":94835,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-15T20:05:23.000Z","msg":"I go to school by bus"},{"pid":"a0468501ea8eb23142a36afcb08b6685fda910a2","tid":361067,"uid":25558,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-16T02:09:06.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/fire.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c62d00c9e7eee2b2ce39012b6ee2bdb0a793be2e","tid":361067,"uid":79563,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-16T02:54:56.000Z","msg":"等睇人又吹奏返黃之峰"},{"pid":"df46813137bbf4282c68edb77d96c1cf93e9b96c","tid":361067,"uid":22858,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-16T03:04:45.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>等睇人又吹奏返黃之峰</blockquote><br />\n如果一坐監即上神枱 <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/photo.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0a535a566bd6564958b0823f2ffde59376267d10","tid":361067,"uid":44358,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-16T03:15:10.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>等睇人又吹奏返黃之峰</blockquote><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">柒小陣，咪咁多私怨，攪到自己成隻熱狗啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> </span></strong></span>"},{"pid":"f3127b6cf461213542546849f5cd1dc4b69a5489","tid":361067,"uid":34872,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-16T03:19:55.000Z","msg":"仲玩偶像崇拜"},{"pid":"c3fc2f3b42854518bd8acf73a56d216a29529344","tid":361067,"uid":25558,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-18T02:56:07.000Z","msg":"留名"},{"pid":"4aa1eff8962deae616ec37d9141e8356f3ea52a2","tid":361067,"uid":25558,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-18T05:54:45.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"29e3809826d23f7a93259fc5ba3fc6cfa0ce3a37","tid":361067,"uid":59898,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-18T05:55:05.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c1b3e58e96a54bbf26e3abb8507d2ad0eb91da07","tid":361067,"uid":53254,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-18T05:55:36.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><blockquote>等睇人又吹奏返黃之峰</blockquote><br />\n如果一坐監即上神枱 <img src=\"/assets/faces/big/photo.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n呢樣真"},{"pid":"2256ad902308a193d25421dcea97e299f4768472","tid":361067,"uid":25558,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-18T09:56:14.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
