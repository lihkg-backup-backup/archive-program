Many front-line workers curtailed interactions with 387 their families and friends for fear of transmitting the disease [22]. Others were treated as pariahs. Front-line workers were required to manage a level of critical illness that they might not usually have managed [23,24]. Infection control measures were burdensome and difficult to bear. Despair and depression became common [23,24]</blockquote><br />\n的確係咁嘅環境底下返工不單止要付出大量體力，心智上亦都因為multitasking, self-blaming而有所挫折。病人係人，同時間醫護都係人，佢地身邊亦都係人。<br />\n<br />\n同時間，出得黎行就要宣誓<br />\n<blockquote>&hellip;<br />\nTo hold him who taught me this art equally dear to me as my parents, to be a partner in life with him, and to fulfill his needs when required; to look upon his offspring as equals to my own siblings, and to teach them this art, if they shall wish to learn it, without fee or contract; and that by the set rules, lectures, and every other mode of instruction, I will impart a knowledge of the art to my own sons, and those of my teachers, and to students bound by this contract and having sworn this Oath to the law of medicine, but to no others.<br />\n&hellip;<br />\nInto whatever homes I go, I will enter them for the benefit of the sick, avoiding any voluntary act of impropriety or corruption, including the seduction of women or men, whether they are free men or slaves.</blockquote><br />\n- The Hippocratic Oath<br />\n最後加埋Bioethics 根本唔會容許你唔返工<br />\ne.g. 冇人監住班病人，走甩咗成個社區就真係能得利橡皮糖。<br />\n係啊，never treat a patient as a means，不過講到人，點為之係人？呢個社會上好多four-limbs-connected-to-one-body嘅野存在。呢個問題，係某年梁醫生喺open day briefing 問在座嘅學生。<br />\n<br />\n比多個scenario。如果要去救一個炒咗車，標緊血嘅愛滋病人，呢樣唔會係問題，如果你有足夠嘅醫學知識，事後食返PErP中招個機會好低。只但係今次CoV同上次一樣，唔夠資訊又唔夠溝通，資源又亂咁調配。加埋，沙士爆果陣點爆，點停，點醫好都仲有好多未confirm 嘅theories。仲推前線救人，即係推人去死。自己屎忽都抹唔乾淨就咪話要照顧人啦。<br />\n<br />\n另外，罷工同時亦都有其他唔同原因而要入廠嘅病人（e.g. 炒車，MI ... etc）<br />\n如果你罷工，邊個去醫呢班人？你攬抄唔單止用你份工，你條命黎同政府攬抄，而屬於你嘅病人都會同你一齊攬炒。你可能冇咗份工，人地可能冇咗條命。炒埋Bioethics同埋個oath。<br />\n<br />\n咁好啦，dialectically 去解決個問題，罷工不罷醫。咁A&amp;E病人點搵醫生？<br />\n<br />\n講埋deontological ethics，我諗我都唔駛瞓。<br />\n<br />\n最後講個笑話啦<br />\n今日老細問我駛唔駛訂定多ＤTamiflu。<br />\n我同佢講「你咪訂囉，到時你同我死咗佢都未過期。」<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1269424/pdf/cc3041.pdf\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC1269424%2Fpdf%2Fcc3041.pdf&d=rcEdfnhTqGmqsB%2B6X%2FYCGZHrfcRVF4fwerrMnmH2A0w%3D&h=8ef1c5bc\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1269424/pdf/cc3041.pdf</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_oath.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nlm.nih.gov%2Fhmd%2Fgreek%2Fgreek_oath.html&d=rcEdfnhTqGmqsB%2B6X%2FYCGZHrfcRVF4fwerrMnmH2A0w%3D&h=01fbb28b\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_oath.html</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n呃like<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Nusinersen194326\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FNusinersen194326&d=rcEdfnhTqGmqsB%2B6X%2FYCGZHrfcRVF4fwerrMnmH2A0w%3D&h=272e38a9\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/Nusinersen194326</a>"},{"pid":"371e0c34940b45aba51307b9079c96fa1d0f8247","tid":1848208,"uid":194326,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-28T22:00:19.000Z","msg":"支持罷工班友自己會唔會罷工？"},{"pid":"cc5103ecfbdb250f31d82a2ca9a5b031577f55d7","tid":1848208,"uid":194326,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-29T00:52:39.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/clown2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5e9a0b9c756c89b8e6d8cba5582ff1603d874bad","tid":1848208,"uid":194326,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-29T09:14:01.000Z","msg":"正經post冇人理"},{"pid":"6ee51a125b313befe92d7e0a2467aae2db283e44","tid":1848208,"uid":194326,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-30T02:10:17.000Z","msg":"最後罷工都係護士佔大多數<br />\n究竟行動之前有諗過幾耐？<br />\n袁國勇都出埋黎講ethics ，你班友就拋個波俾醫護"},{"pid":"b8c456d5009ea2bb9719a86fb1e19d35e0e3c485","tid":1848208,"uid":194326,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T12:20:15.000Z","msg":"結果唔駛一個星期罷緊班友就開始concern返病人<img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n好想知支持「用罷工去抗衡政府」班KOL點兜"}]}
