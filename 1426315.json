Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone.

As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.<br />\n<br />\n天佑香港<br />\n整核彈都唔割<br />\n真心希望前線諗清楚方向，be water，不被捕 不流血<br />\n我星期一罷工，之後睇到新聞心情好沈重，第二日睇到中國記招我灰左。我地要做咩野先可以令個政府聽民意？<br />\n大陸嘅朋友話好灰，因為共黨幾黑暗幾仆街⋯但係我地依度係香港，大家抗爭嘅就係唔想香港被依啲仆街野污染我地嘅香港"}]}
