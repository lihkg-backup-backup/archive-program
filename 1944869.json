They suffered from something the others cannot understand. Normal people cannot take. You guys blame them, it is just because you don't understand them. If you experienced similar things, you will choose to call G too.<br />\n<br />\nImagine, if you were bullied by the girls since primary school, they laugh at you, and judge your outlook as well as lifestyle frequently; if you were betrayed by a girl you love for about 4 years, and she secretly has sex or different kind of relationship with different man, even the people you know, the school teachers, your friends. Will you trust women anymore? Will you have confidence in building a long-term relationship with a woman? <br />\n<br />\n&quot;Call G&quot; is a kind of method to promote social justice, especially for those who have experienced unfair treatment from the women."},{"pid":"34aee7153edda909846ca1541ba496df66694efc","tid":1944869,"uid":189179,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-26T16:30:36.000Z","msg":"&quot;叫雞正義&quot;是用來回應女性&quot;身體自主&quot;的社會觀念"}]}
