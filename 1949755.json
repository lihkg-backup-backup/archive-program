In both situations, a hidden iframe is employed to load and execute malicious code.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The URLs used led to a malicious website created by the attacker, which in turn contained three iframes that pointed to different sites,&quot; Trend Micro researchers said. &quot;The only visible iframe leads to a legitimate news site, which makes people believe they are visiting the said site. One invisible iframe was used for website analytics; the other led to a site hosting the main script of the iOS exploits.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/gBXQaeU.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FgBXQaeU.jpg&h=d72fcdc0&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"5494f09d185bd46dd9ea3a4f8426b98aa66656c3","tid":1949755,"uid":7580,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:27:50.000Z","msg":"The malware in question exploits a &quot;silently patched&quot; Safari vulnerability, which when rendered on the browser leads to the exploitation of a use after free memory flaw (tracked as CVE-2019-8605) that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges &mdash; in this case, install the proprietary LightSpy backdoor. The bug has since been resolved with the release of iOS 12.3, macOS Mojave 10.14.5, tvOS 12.3, and watchOS 5.2.1.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\">The spyware is not just capable of remotely executing shell commands and taking full control of the device.

an Android variant of the same malware that was distributed last year through open Telegram channels under the guise of Hong Kong protest calendar apps among others.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;dmsSpy's download and command-and-control servers used the same domain name (hkrevolution[.]club) as one of the watering holes used by the iOS component of Poisoned News,&quot; the researchers observed.<br />\n<br />\nOnce installed, these rogue Android apps harvested and exfiltrated contacts, text messages, the user's location, and the names of stored files.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;This particular framework and infrastructure is an interesting example of an agile approach to developing and deploying surveillance framework in Southeast Asia,&quot; Kaspersky researchers concluded.<br />\n<br />\nTrend Micro, for its part, suggested the design and functionality of the campaign aim to compromise as many mobile devices as possible to enable device backdooring and surveillance.<br />\n<br />\nTo mitigate such threats, it's essential that users keep their devices up-to-date and avoid sideloading apps on Android from unauthorized sources.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSource: <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/03/iphone-iOS-spyware.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthehackernews.com%2F2020%2F03%2Fiphone-iOS-spyware.html&d=UCtUugLpQcFJMmY1nWpYqwZ9jGrNtOn8RK6k%2FrDhOJo%3D&h=08afb2bf\" target=\"_blank\">https://thehackernews.com/2020/03/iphone-iOS-spyware.html</a>"},{"pid":"8fa708fc3f8b084e52e6edbbfeb7d92c7822c100","tid":1949755,"uid":106336,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:29:34.000Z","msg":"有無tldr 咁長<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5b82fa6e5505a0ad5fd30890bb24a801178652ad","tid":1949755,"uid":2419,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:29:35.000Z","msg":"連登都可能有賤種會貼 小心"},{"pid":"4347c685c837dcbefd5bde840bb88dd3d9b63c41","tid":1949755,"uid":7580,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:29:45.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"dfc8b76f13069c9db4962e0db8f45c4c0e73d85e","tid":1949755,"uid":7580,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:31:19.000Z","msg":"推俾多啲人睇到"},{"pid":"154eacb0c8fcddc6241e51fc858dc1b3b2d3762d","tid":1949755,"uid":219747,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:35:04.000Z","msg":"個CVE都18/19年 好大機會更新左冇事"},{"pid":"8f4f6eb0451ea17f287b647371b1e5c63e6ab093","tid":1949755,"uid":7580,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"8fa708fc3f8b084e52e6edbbfeb7d92c7822c100","tid":1949755,"uid":106336,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:29:34.000Z","msg":"有無tldr 咁長<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:35:09.000Z","msg":"所以我特登highlight咗啲紅色字出嚟俾啲懶人睇 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1645c0925e2a8da78829e7ef043e3579ba14b184","tid":1949755,"uid":106336,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"8f4f6eb0451ea17f287b647371b1e5c63e6ab093","tid":1949755,"uid":7580,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"8fa708fc3f8b084e52e6edbbfeb7d92c7822c100","tid":1949755,"uid":106336,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:29:34.000Z","msg":"有無tldr 咁長<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:35:09.000Z","msg":"所以我特登highlight咗啲紅色字出嚟俾啲懶人睇 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:35:32.000Z","msg":"好 我睇吓先<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"cf4b4ce24f4bf7f1ccc00c0902ad5b4c510bdc74","tid":1949755,"uid":7580,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T01:46:47.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"511f1da3ef3dc176881946a7d379028b32996751","tid":1949755,"uid":131078,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T03:36:50.000Z","msg":"求下大家落patch 啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"57ea576432de0d2aeda4acb3dfc8ceb258dc829d","tid":1949755,"uid":71092,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T03:40:35.000Z","msg":"下"},{"pid":"65280af9a890296732aa7c6f5072b502c9907b9a","tid":1949755,"uid":56115,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T04:19:12.000Z","msg":"班舊機+ios10.x寧願刪左tg都唔會理你啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5fa56646c46a56105624e762d6347a05821b65c7","tid":1949755,"uid":79355,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-30T04:35:57.000Z","msg":"iPhone都會中毒架咩<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/scare.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
