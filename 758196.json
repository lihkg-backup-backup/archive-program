Jeremy Hunt will participate in the UK-China Strategic Dialogue in Beijing on 30 July.<br />\n<br />\nThe letter underlines the importance of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and expresses concerns that &ldquo;pressure on human rights and basic freedoms in Hong Kong has increased and intensified&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nSir Malcolm Rifkind and Lord Ashdown are joined as signatories to the letter by Labour MP Catherine West, crossbench peer Lord Alton of Liverpool, and leading international barrister Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, who was chief prosecutor in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic.<br />\n<br />\nIn the letter, the five signatories said: &ldquo;The United Kingdom has a unique relationship with Hong Kong due to the Sino-British Joint Declaration. This agreement underpins the special trading relationship that the United Kingdom has with Hong Kong because &lsquo;one-country, two-systems&rsquo; ensures that it has the robust rule of law, freedom of information, labour rights, intellectual property rights, and transparency which our businesses need. It is also an important example in the region of a city where basic human rights are upheld to the benefit of all.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe five signatories are patrons of Hong Kong Watch. They outlined concerns that freedom of expression was under threat and the judiciary under pressure.   <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;<span style=\"color: gold;\">Freedom of expression is facing threats from multiple fronts, with the abduction of booksellers, the removal of academics from their posts, the imprisonment of pro-democracy protesters, the disqualification of pro-democracy legislators and candidates for the legislature,</span> and last week, the threat that a <span style=\"color: red;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">political party faced being banned on the grounds that it was a &lsquo;national security threat&rsquo;,&rdquo;</span></span> they said.<br />\n<br />\nThey continued: &ldquo;The judiciary is also under pressure. The former Court of Final Appeal Judge, Kemal Bokhary, has warned that Hong Kong&rsquo;s courts are facing a &lsquo;storm of unprecedented ferocity&rsquo; while other judges have said that the increasing use of interpretative powers by Beijing could compromise Hong Kong&rsquo;s rule of law. Britain&rsquo;s businesses pick Hong Kong because it has a robust, independent judiciary. It is vital that the mainland government understand the importance of non-interference in Hong Kong&rsquo;s courts, so that Hong Kong continues to maintain its status as &lsquo;Asia&rsquo;s World City&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nOn other issues, the letter welcomed Mr Hunt&rsquo;s attempt to strengthen the United Kingdom&rsquo;s relationship with China in economic, security and environmental matters, saying that &ldquo;collaboration is vital if we are to confront the international threats posed by terrorism and climate change. China&rsquo;s resources and expertise will be essential if we are to tackle the grave threat posed by rising sea levels and air pollution around the world.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"96f32704d9c7f128ac4f49c3919ef605cd9896d0","tid":758196,"uid":47359,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-27T12:37:23.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7df51344e4a77fba5a36fdd34b8dcf2905cf6589","tid":758196,"uid":123456,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-27T12:45:02.000Z","msg":"ok"},{"pid":"c46d827be8db36a9a6b22a63097e5cd1e47e3699","tid":758196,"uid":19126,"like":1,"dislike":2,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-27T12:50:20.000Z","msg":"關心就行動啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1804c6f7fc5225849d98d9967ebf55bfb51c2696","tid":758196,"uid":81113,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-27T12:57:11.000Z","msg":"出手啦"},{"pid":"2e215b6ae799b2486a6fe9224da36021041f9a95","tid":758196,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"7df51344e4a77fba5a36fdd34b8dcf2905cf6589","tid":758196,"uid":123456,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-27T12:45:02.000Z","msg":"ok"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-27T13:53:07.000Z","msg":"五毛求銀祈<img src=\"https://img.eservice-hk.net/upload/2018/07/27/215305_ea3dc39ca0b2f6b5f17abddec1f0e9a4.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.eservice-hk.net%2Fupload%2F2018%2F07%2F27%2F215305_ea3dc39ca0b2f6b5f17abddec1f0e9a4.png&h=2a47f71f&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"36f7654c1ea08fbca7166cf88143b58c337b01fa","tid":758196,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-27T14:07:13.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"2f4a54f4e4f27d60725a4f51df0c7febfafddf79","tid":758196,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-27T14:36:59.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1811e55a59339ec6ae5e690476c1c2344da4923c","tid":758196,"uid":190928,"like":1,"dislike":2,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-27T14:37:50.000Z","msg":"hong kong watch 咩嚟"},{"pid":"a9f30354b4112832f2ad32fa9814d947fb307705","tid":758196,"uid":120678,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"1811e55a59339ec6ae5e690476c1c2344da4923c","tid":758196,"uid":190928,"like":1,"dislike":2,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-27T14:37:50.000Z","msg":"hong kong watch 咩嚟"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-27T14:47:55.000Z","msg":"一個英國既非官方團體，負責觀察香港政治局勢變化<br />\n好似話肥彭都響裡面"},{"pid":"4503543dc91b4b48921773d585edf891d3810bca","tid":758196,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-28T04:15:18.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b64c35405f92fe8eae353c75959a06cda87dfbf0","tid":758196,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-28T06:06:50.000Z","msg":"會員#蔣介石(翻生)再度公開本土派人士及其女朋友樣貌<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://lih.kg/brOCkS\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://lih.kg/brOCkS</a><br />\n<br />\nLIHKG @ Android"},{"pid":"42073d2f1f23a600b95bcf70218b80b2e5bef1cf","tid":758196,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-28T11:57:57.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"25e135355ba582ca379d6b03d32cbe7ae0bbe411","tid":758196,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-30T02:49:10.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7f5510d85dfd02f2d2ba4d156e2215e201037e50","tid":758196,"uid":179938,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-30T04:04:18.000Z","msg":"關心<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
