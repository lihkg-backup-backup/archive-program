By Chapman Chen, HKBNews<br />\nSummary: The so-called &quot;Anti-Extradition Law&quot; movement has become a revolution since June without a name. Let me suggest that it be called &quot;Hong Kong Time Revolution香港時代革命&quot;. HK Chief Executive Carrie Lam herself said in English on Aug. 5 that the &quot;ulterior motives&quot; of some of the &quot;violent protesters...are to...risk the one country, two systems...and...to proceed with what they call revolution.&quot; Indeed, &quot;Reclaim Hong Kong; Time Revolution光復香港，時代革命!&quot; is the most commonly chanted slogan of the activists. Their aim has escalated beyond the withdrawal of the Extradition Bill to universal suffrage and full autonomy, or freedom from China colonization, just like the 1776 American Revolution against British colonization. 3 million Hongkongers have come out in mass rallies.  People of all ages, ethnicities, classes, from all walks of life, have joined in the fight in their own ways.
