Some would say that was wrong, but I thought it was appropriate because the truth and integrity of the picture were maintained.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/09.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"176ec66b18e916c6bb6cafeb1bc0703e5b90e1ba","tid":709787,"uid":163554,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-20T09:58:56.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"9802f67e1c52249806ea437b660f1613f8803944","tid":709787,"uid":38218,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-20T11:24:58.000Z","msg":"首先我認同photoshop其實唔係啲咩大問題 <br />\n 如果只係為咗令張相嘅顏色更加突出<br />\n或者睇落去更加visually pleasing<br />\n梗係冇問題<br />\n但如果係將相片本身嘅內容修變<br />\n咁就係令一回事<br />\n<br />\n陳生, 我覺得你應該將原先嘅報導嘅link放返出嚟會好啲<br />\n如果冇估錯，<br />\n呢一段說話應該係黎自Time嘅一篇報導<br />\nTitle: Steve McCurry: I'm a <span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Visual Storyteller</span></strong></span> Not a Photojournalist<br />\n大約兩年前，<br />\nSteve McCurry畀人踢爆<br />\n以前有部份相係執走咗相入面本身嘅人，<br />\n或者加多個人落去<br />\n佢之後都笠水或自己只係一個visual teller<br />\n而唔係一個photojournalist<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com.hk/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4351725/steve-mccurry-not-photojournalist\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com.hk%2Famp%2Famp.timeinc.net%2Ftime%2F4351725%2Fsteve-mccurry-not-photojournalist&d=f1ak%2FKx76gFv0bJ44sDKYBFQyUQXuyYblCT5RSyYNoQ%3D&h=1a929d8f\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.google.com.hk/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4351725/steve-mccurry-not-photojournalist</a>"}]}
