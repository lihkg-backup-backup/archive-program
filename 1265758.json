The Shandong House Church Christians traveled to Xinjiang in the name of tourism. After learning about the living conditions of local Christian, they know the fact that: The Chinese government could take away the Christians for no reason, the people live in fear.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the &quot;Winter&quot; magazine, which has long been concerned about human rights and religious freedom in China, the Christians in Shandong revealed that they felt that the local atmosphere was terrible as soon as they arrived in Xinjiang. The police were everywhere armed with patrols, and every place was covered with monitors. There is a checkpoint on the road without a few meters.<br />\n<br />\nShandong Christians pointed out that he was only taking pictures at the sights. The police came over and forced him to delete the photos. If a group of people spoke on the street, they would be driven by the police. In addition, when they mentioned the topic of religion, the children in Xinjiang next to them quickly reminded them to stop talking.<br />\n<br />\nOn Sunday, when the Shandong church members passed the church, they saw a number of police officers standing at the door. Those who wanted to go in must take out their identity cards for inspection. Xinjiang Christians also revealed to them, &quot;The government can arrest Christians for no reason. Some people are arrested and have no news.&quot; Even the church pastor have been arrested for &quot;re-education camps&quot;. I don't know when they released.<br />\n<br />\nUnder such circumstances, Shandong Christian members did not even dare to call the local church members because the phone had been monitored. The locals only said &quot;God&quot; on the phone, the call would be cut off immediately. They have to use another way to communicate to each other. For example, when you come out to meet, you have to say &quot;go out to eat lamb.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nIn fact, Christians in Xinjiang are now difficult to meet, because there are monitors in every place, and electronic cards are required to go in and out. The comers are closely monitored by community members. So the Christians had to get up early to their mountain meeting at 5 o'clock every morning, because the supervisors had not yet gone to work. Such community members are also responsible for home visit. As long as they are registered as Christians, they must learn patriotic knowledge and national policies once a week."},{"pid":"84fca3e614679ee065ea4a37df4a5afdfdd30275","tid":1265758,"uid":76310,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T10:42:49.000Z","msg":"我英文唔太好, 英文好既人, 可以幫我改一改文法, 然後幫上推上rebbit, 等西方社會知道強国如何照顧基督徒<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ad797c9f1518d661c03613081115a4a2e622017d","tid":1265758,"uid":76310,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T10:46:49.000Z","msg":"幫手post<br />\n文宣<br />\n我已經譯埋, 只係希望有人幫手post<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c758c57dc494f0da200ac2d40bbecd228ce7c776","tid":1265758,"uid":259675,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T10:48:12.000Z","msg":"pish"},{"pid":"e33d47e6499a7e3184d3c68f863d1e191cc0a730","tid":1265758,"uid":76310,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T10:53:32.000Z","msg":"幫手post咋喎<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"fcb62426146001e7902b99c0cffff82bd4ad2262","tid":1265758,"uid":76310,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T10:56:55.000Z","msg":"幫手<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"00b1b46c862caac0c0a42128f23f662175bf30e5","tid":1265758,"uid":138233,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T11:14:12.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bouncer.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bouncer.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bouncer.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bouncer.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bouncer.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"47868f55392b26e078f57fc11e463dd40c9b902c","tid":1265758,"uid":76310,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T11:42:28.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e51a1c5931333ad744c4ffcf840cdbed81135ab1","tid":1265758,"uid":258770,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T11:44:48.000Z","msg":"無圖無source 唔係話單新聞假但係比較難有人肯睇 <br />\n要等到有知名度高既外媒去新疆採訪先有機會"},{"pid":"dd156d79010dbc64e31d6c805061a7a3ef40c4a9","tid":1265758,"uid":76310,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"e51a1c5931333ad744c4ffcf840cdbed81135ab1","tid":1265758,"uid":258770,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T11:44:48.000Z","msg":"無圖無source 唔係話單新聞假但係比較難有人肯睇 <br />\n要等到有知名度高既外媒去新疆採訪先有機會"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T11:50:26.000Z","msg":"有條link<br />\n唔係我作<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"096091f3aef770f03597453cc31c7abcdb926fc9","tid":1265758,"uid":223428,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"ad797c9f1518d661c03613081115a4a2e622017d","tid":1265758,"uid":76310,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T10:46:49.000Z","msg":"幫手post<br />\n文宣<br />\n我已經譯埋, 只係希望有人幫手post<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T11:54:35.000Z","msg":"已post"},{"pid":"1e44e424076ab0bdae6246f8a026c7e15097f640","tid":1265758,"uid":211566,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-29T11:54:58.000Z","msg":"Rebbit<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
