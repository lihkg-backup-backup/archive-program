We anticipate interviewing applicants only in exceptional circumstances. </em></strong>However, if there are to be any interviews this year, they will likely take place in the weeks of either [5 or 12 August 2019](after our receipt of applicants&rsquo; final results by the transcript deadline earlier in August). In view of the tight timing, applicants will be invited for interview at very short notice. If at all possible, therefore, we would ask applicants who have still not heard from us by then to keep those weeks free, in case they are invited for interview.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Question 19:<br />\n<br />\nOnly students with a 2:1 or equivalent will be admitted to the HKU PCLL?<br />\n<br />\nAnswer:<br />\n<br />\nThe legal profession has set a benchmark for admission to the PCLL of a &quot;high 2.2&quot; degree and all three law schools have been following that benchmark. Our focus in admissions is on academic merit and in this regard, we look primarily at an applicant's All Law Average (the average mark of all Law subjects studied over the entirety of an applicant's qualifying law degree) in light of relevant grading practice rather than just by the class of his or her degree. This means that applicants are treated equally, with their marks compared, as much as practicable, on a like-for-like basis. In past years, applicants with a 2.2 degree have been offered a place on the PCLL if their marks are sufficiently competitive. <strong><em>We also hold a limited number of interviews for the last 10-15 places on the part-time programme for those applicants whose marks are not sufficiently competitive but who are able to demonstrate genuine legal working experience.</em></strong> Such legal working experience must be of at least 2 years in total duration, involve the use of legal skills such as research, drafting and advising clients and does not include internships or mini-pupillages.&quot; <br />\n<br />\n估計HKU每年interview既人數應該少於20人，而何謂exceptional case真係好難講，但肯肯定既就係師兄份application同其他applicants有明顯分別。可能師兄成績係marginal case（係唔係無2:1？）？係咪出黎做過幾年野？係咪有咩殘疾而試過defer？如果第一同第二個問題及答案都係【係】，我自己認為師兄應該prep下自己過去幾年係legal field做過咩，有咩contribution，有無處理過大case或者幫過法官做野（court clerk），你既工作經驗如何係未來既1年到2年既PCLL course入邊幫到你。或者唸定點解釋自己成績唔夠既情況下如何勝任PCLL等等（當然如果你係solid 2:1就唔洗prep呢條啦，但問心我唔覺得hku會interview有solid 2:1既applicant）。當然，你一定要prep埋個D基本野，例如personal statement個400字講過咩做過咩，點解想做律師，人生有無D咩決定性時刻係令你覺得你係destine to become a lawyer之類。之前唔知係邊到睇過hku pcll interview係2揀1，1/2機會，希望你入到。<br />\n<br />\n香港人，加油。"},{"pid":"b6c3f94b86ec4377ea18f8749861a56a9470071c","tid":1439776,"uid":7177,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:18:29.000Z","msg":"介唔介意share咩u同gpa ?"},{"pid":"72309520b103ad20ebb5f5730c3e167b78b6901f","tid":1439776,"uid":258956,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-20T11:39:53.000Z","msg":"今日啱啱收到email 收咗啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/biggrin.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n一路都無消息，interview 都無，肴到我<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n利申：hku FT"},{"pid":"a8309fad7d7c1f5efe0a1dc231a5272ce4f24af8","tid":1439776,"uid":229019,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"72309520b103ad20ebb5f5730c3e167b78b6901f","tid":1439776,"uid":258956,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-20T11:39:53.000Z","msg":"今日啱啱收到email 收咗啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/biggrin.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n一路都無消息，interview 都無，肴到我<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n利申：hku FT"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-20T18:39:57.000Z","msg":"介唔介意share咩u同gpa ?"}]}
