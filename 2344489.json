We analyzed T cell and neutralizing antibody responses in 136 healthcare workers (HCW) 16-18 weeks after United Kingdom lockdown, 76 of whom had mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection captured by serial sampling. Neutralizing antibodies (nAb) were present in 89% of previously infected HCW. T cell responses tended to be lower following asymptomatic infection than in those reporting case-definition symptoms of COVID-19, while nAb titers were maintained irrespective of symptoms. T cell and antibody responses were sometimes discordant. Eleven percent lacked nAb and had undetectable T cell responses to spike protein but had T cells reactive with other SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Our findings suggest that the majority of individuals with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection carry nAb complemented by multispecific T cell responses at 16-18 weeks after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/immunology/5/54/eabf3698.full.pdf\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimmunology.sciencemag.org%2Fcontent%2Fimmunology%2F5%2F54%2Feabf3698.full.pdf&d=vFDcqKLMx6N8Vlwxc9Uzx7yOm5tzSGwlZJ%2FCF8Wpw90%3D&h=6dc9c461\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/immunology/5/54/eabf3698.full.pdf</a>"}]}
