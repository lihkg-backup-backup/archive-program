First, the government should consider adopting legislation which will ensure that there are consequences if the Hong Kong government continues to trample on people&rsquo;s freedoms. <span style=\"color: red;\">Magnitsky sanctions, targeted at the individual violators of human rights, could be applied to officials who are deemed to be responsible for breaches of the Joint Declaration.</span><br />\n<br />\nSecond, post-Brexit,<span style=\"color: red;\"> any trade agreement with Hong Kong or China must include a Hong Kong human rights clause.</span> Trade law is more strongly enforceable than other types of international law, and so it is critical that we do not betray our commitment to Hong Kong in any future negotiations.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, many parliamentarians have signalled their support for various campaigns which would provide an insurance policy by extending the rights applicable to holders of British National (Overseas) passports. <br />\n<br />\nUnlike in other British colonies, Hong Kong citizens were not allowed to maintain their British citizenship after the handover. Instead they were fobbed off with second tier &ldquo;BNO&rdquo; passports which the late-Lord Ashdown claimed were a scandal rivalling Windrush. Even soldiers who had served in the British army were not given the right to retain their British citizenship. <br />\n<br />\nIt would be easy for the government to <span style=\"color: red;\">expand the rights held by BNO passports, and the Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Tugendhat has argued that this would provide many Hong Kongers with the &ldquo;confidence to stay in Hong Kong&rdquo;, knowing that they have a possible way out.</span><br />\n<br />\nDuring the handover negotiations, prime minister John Major declared that &ldquo;Hong Kong will never walk alone&rdquo;. At this pivotal hour in Hong Kong&rsquo;s history, we must not forget our unique ties to the people of Hong Kong. We must stand with them in their fight for freedom. They must not walk alone."},{"pid":"3fc4b02fcfbe446d6f911b8301232605cde019ef","tid":1616587,"uid":3149,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T13:21:41.000Z","msg":"Push <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"9680c29edb4007bc13625770690e852bf7223261","tid":1616587,"uid":194325,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T13:22:09.000Z","msg":"香港人俾政府恰到上心口！<br />\n「反蒙面法」有機會聽日立埋<br />\n如果你連三罷公投都唔表態<br />\n你 註定輸一世！<br />\n<br />\n公投截止日期：10月11日中午12點<br />\n<br />\nThe Government treat all HongKongers as nothing and they also want to pass the anti-mask law to tackle protesters.<br />\nIt is time for us to speak up!
