After 2 months of continuous protests, Hong Kong government still not respond to any of citizens five demands. Instead, they start to use excessive violence and wish to end all of it by an irrational way.  It has been more than 2 months until now, Hong Kong&rsquo;s people still not receive any response from their government but they got the attention and support from the global.    Protest will not been end itself. It will only be end until &ldquo;Carrie Lam - the Chief Executive of HKSAR&rdquo; respond to citizens FIVE DEMANDS and those must be fulfill.   &ldquo;United we stand, together we hope.&rdquo;  Hong Kong people you will never be alone.
