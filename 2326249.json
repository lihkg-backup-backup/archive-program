That conduct is excused,&rsquo; Khandelwal said, according to KOMO .</span></span></strong><br />\n<br />\nThe proposal, however, excludes misdemeanors related to domestic violence and impaired

of criminal behavior in our city&rsquo;.<br />\n<br />\nHe argues that the new defense would be made at the expense of local store owners and others impacted by misdemeanor crimes.<br />\n<br />\n&lsquo;It leans on the scales heavily in favor of certain individuals based on status, and it says to others, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo;, adding the legislation would come as a defense attorney&rsquo;s &lsquo;dream&rsquo;.<br />\n<br />\nSeattle City Attorney Pete Holmes, meanwhile, said he welcomes the upcoming discussion but said the changes aren&rsquo;t strictly necessary as his office already avoids prosecuting &lsquo;survival&rsquo;
