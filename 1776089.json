With your tremendous support, the parents of Tsz-Lok have managed to stay strong during this very difficult time. <br />\n<br />\nIn response to the kind thoughts of fellow students, alumni, faculty and staff of HKUST to pay the last respect to Tsz-Lok, the family will hold a memorial service at Tai Wai Po Fook Memorial Hall (大圍寶福紀念館) on 12 December 2019 (Thursday) between 5pm to 8pm.  HKUST members departing from campus can take the university coach at the Sundial roundabout at 6:15pm.  Depending on traffic conditions, the return ride may leave the memorial hall at around 7:30pm, with two drop-off stops at Tai Wai East Rail Station &amp; Diamond Hill MTR station. If you prefer to go by yourselves, please take the free shuttle bus from Tai Wai East Rail Station (Exit D, F or G).<br />\n<br />\nThose who cannot make it to the memorial service in person and would like to show support by giving condolence money can make a deposit to one of the following bank accounts* by 16 Dec 2019 (Monday). The University will help collect the condolence money and hand over to Chow&rsquo;s family.

May Tsz-Lok&rsquo;s soul rest in eternal peace.<br />\n<br />\nBest regards,<br />\nTim K.T.
