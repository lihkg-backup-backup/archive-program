As an academic, it's imperative to question all the news until there is solid evidence, hence I had been cynical to such reports. Naturally, I also sincerely hope that no one innocent has been killed and wanted to dismiss it as fake news.<br />\n<br />\n這懷疑，昨天一掃而空。有學術界的朋友把最近「自殺」的個案做了一個整合，看到了之後，令人不寒而慄。雖然沒有實質證據指證警察，但數據實在太巧合，令人很難懷疑警察沒有殺人，然後故意毀滅證據。<br />\n<br />\nThis skepticism has been swept away completely since yesterday. A friend from academic circles have together all the data of all the recent &quot;suicide&quot; cases, and a chill ran down my spine upon reading it. Although there is not concrete evidence against the police, the data presented is simply too coincidental to ignore. The chances of the police killing the protestors and then ridding of the evidence is rather high.<br />\n<br />\n朋友找到了從 6 月 12 日到 9 月 10 日的 109 個自殺個案報導（圖一）。裡面當然包含了義士在太古廣場外面墮樓的自殺個案。<br />\n<br />\nThe academic looked up on all the reported cases of suicide from the 12th of June till the 10th of September (Figure 1). There were a total of 109 cases, and it definitely included the martyr who fell to his death at Pacific Place.<br />\n<br />\n首先，雖然每個月其實都有自殺個案，但朋友發覺，從 6 月 12 號，每十天，自殺個案都維持在大約 10 人左右（最多也只是 6 月 21 到 30 號，有 12 人）（圖二）。<br />\n<br />\nThe first discovery was that despite there've been cases of suicide every month, the numbers stayed roughly around 10 cases over each ten day period since the 12th of June. The highest figure was 12 cases which occurred between the 21st of June till the 30th of June (figure 2).<br />\n<br />\n而令人驚訝的是，8 月 21 到 31 日，自殺個案突然飆升至 18 人（當時是新屋嶺事件剛剛曝光，有 6 位太平紳士，及超過 200 位律師要求入內但不被允許）。而 9 月 1 號到 10 號的時段，個案更上升至28個！而這時段是剛剛是 831 事件過後，警察在太子站亂打無辜市民的時候。<br />\n<br />\nThe shocking revelation was that there have been 18 cases of suicide between the 21st of August till the 31st of August. (This was around the time when the allegations of Sun Uk Ling Holding Centre had come to light. Six justices of the peace and over 200 lawyers seeked permission to visit the detention centre but were all denied entry.) From the 1st of September till the 10th of September, the reported cases of suicide shot up to 28!

In June and July, there's been zero cases of suicide from people who are younger than 20 years old. However, there've been 4 of such cases in August alone; there has also been an increase for those who are between 20 - 30 years old, with 9 such cases in August.

It's baffling to say the least."},{"pid":"009b16965ff0d5240f79b806ef467fd1c2e052bb","tid":1576629,"uid":153647,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-19T16:54:20.000Z","msg":"第三點是（亦都是讓我覺得最奇怪的一點）發現屍體的時間（圖四）。整合資料之後，發覺大部分發現屍體時間都是早上 5 時到 7 時（以每個小時計算，每個時段發現屍體的數目平均是 4 至 5 個，凌晨時段更是只是 2 至 3 個，但早上 5 時到 6 時有 12 具屍體被發現，而 6 時都 7 時也是有 12具屍體發現。為什麼屍體會集中在早上 5 時到 7 時呢？那些時候除了晨運的公公婆婆和報紙攤檔員工，真的沒有什麼人會在街上閒逛然後發現屍體。<br />\n<br />\nThirdly, (and also the part which I find the most mysterious) the time in which the bodies were discovered should be of interest (figure 4). After gathering all the information, it's obvious that most of the bodies were discovered between 5 - 7 a.m. (At an hourly rate, most hours have an average of 4 - 5 discoveries, and around 2 - 3 over midnight. But from 5 - 6 a.m., there've been 12 discoveries, and the same can be said for the period between 6 - 7 a.m. Why were there an increase in such reports between 5 - 7 in the morning? During these hours, only the elderly who go about their morning exercise routines and those in charge of the newspaper stands are on the streets, otherwise, there shouldn't be many wanderers to discover so many dead bodies.)<br />\n<br />\n雖然這些數據因為數目關係，很難做統計找 p-value，但為什麼 8 月底 9 月頭自殺數字突然飆升？很難不懷疑個案裡頭有「被自殺」事件；為什麼這麼多屍體在早上 5 至 6 時發現？很難不讓人懷疑是不是有人在凌晨時段運送屍體都現場「被發現」；為什麼 20 到 30 歲的年齡層多了？除了有自殺以明志的個案以外，有沒有其他特別個案？<br />\n<br />\nAlthough it's difficult to find the statistical p-value because of the limited amount of data available, it's hard not to question the spike in suicide cases towards the end of August till the beginning of September. It's natural to suspect at least some of the cases had been staged, and to question why is a significant portion of these bodies being discovered between 5 - 7 in the morning. Perhaps someone transferred the dead bodies to the scenes for &quot;discovery&quot; around midnight? How about the rise in suicide rate for those in their 20s? Apart from some well documented cases of suicide to express their political concerns, has there been other special cases?<br />\n<br />\n數據以外，有一些個案亦很耐人尋味，8 月 15 日，元朗裕景坊早上 7 時發現有 19 歲的男子跳樓自殺，警方說死者是擔心學業，但當時無論是校內或公開試成績已經一早出爐，為什麼到 15 號才突然想不開？ 而同月 31 號屯門卓爾居有一 17 歲男子吊頸自殺， 69 歲的父親發現屍體，但要等消防處出現才解開屍體繩子？報道說「警方於現場沒有檢獲遺書，事件沒有可疑」，17 歲的男孩沒有遺書突然吊頸自殺，實在令人更覺可疑。<br />\n<br />\nRaw data aside, some of the cases also appear rather dubious. On the 15th of August, a 19 year old man was found dead from suicide at Yu King Square in Yuen Long. The police said the deceased was under severe academic pressure, yet the results of both internal school exams and public exams have long been released, so why did he wait till the 15th to end his life? On the 31st of the same month, a 17 year old boy living in Chelsea Heights in Tuen Mun  hung himself and was discovered by his 69 year old father. The strangest part of this incident was only when the firemen showed up did they untied the ropes. According to reports, &quot;the police didn't find any death notes at the scene, and the case is categorised as not suspicious&quot;. Surely a 17 year old boy who suddenly decided to hang himself without leaving a suicide note is very suspicious.<br />\n<br />\n我當然不是指控所有自殺個案都是警察所為，但綜觀數據及看過某些特定個案以後，很難令人不懷疑這些個案當中，有否混雜了太子站打死人的個案？或混雜了新屋嶺打死人的個案？雖然我很不願意相信警察真的會把人打至死亡，但聽到關於防暴警察的訓練及心理質素，以及警隊把示威者非人化，實在很有可能相信那些不受控的防暴警察，打得瘋狂，錯手殺死無辜市民，然後整個警隊把這些個案以各種方式蒙蔽真相。<br />\n<br />\nI am definitely not accusing the police of being behind all of the suicide cases, but looking at all the data and some particular cases, it's almost impossible to not at least suspect some of the suicides had some of the dead people from Prince Edward MTR station or the Sun Uk Ling Holding Centre mixed in. Despite my unwillingness to believe that the police would actually beat someone to death,  I've also heard of how the riot police train and their mental capacity, not to mention them referring to protestors as &ldquo;cockroaches&rdquo;. It is very much within the realm of possibility that some riot police have committed manslaughter during the heat of the moment when beating up those innocent citizens, then the whole police force have to use these cases to cover up the truth via various means."},{"pid":"72a40f82ceaa7d777dfb7f35f03c3a15da900489","tid":1576629,"uid":153647,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-19T16:54:31.000Z","msg":"打這篇數據展示及分析的時候，我心其實都在顫抖，一邊為警察邪惡的所作所為感到無比驚訝，亦為無辜死者感到極度難過。願有日真相大白，還這些無辜死者一個公道，讓其靈魂得以安息。<br />\n<br />\nMy heart is actually trembling in fear as I am typing out this data presentation and analysis.
