I think it's a terrible thing to do, but I wouldn't lock a person up for doing it. I would point out how ridiculous it seems to me to do such an act.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nIn 1989, before Ginsburg joined the court, the Supreme Court held that the conviction of a man named Gregory Lee Johnson for burning the flag was inconsistent with the First Amendment.<br />\n<br />\nOf the athletes, Ginsburg said, &quot;if they want to be stupid, there's no law that should be preventive. If they want to be arrogant, there's no law that prevents them from that. What I would do is strongly take issue with the point of view that they are expressing when they do that.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nGinsburg's words were similar to the comments that the late Justice Antonin Scalia made when he was asked about his vote in favor of Johnson in the flag burning case.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;If I were King,&quot; Scalia told CNN's Piers Morgan in 2012, &quot;I would not allow people to go about burning the American flag. However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/10/10/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-colin-kaepernick/index.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Famp.cnn.com%2Fcnn%2F2016%2F10%2F10%2Fpolitics%2Fruth-bader-ginsburg-colin-kaepernick%2Findex.html&d=oKnYn5PLwsF01pzJS7XelhQiWlS3rEx2Iifn9b7K3wo%3D&h=21654c7c\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Famp.cnn.com%2Fcnn%2F2016%2F10%2F10%2Fpolitics%2Fruth-bader-ginsburg-colin-kaepernick%2Findex.html&h=96b50f53\" target=\"_blank\">https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/10/10/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-colin-kaepernick/index.html</a></span>"},{"pid":"d0ffe79ed870e4ac040368b7810a522a64b738c5","tid":2057736,"uid":153151,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-09T15:21:49.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/9Xz0C0n.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2F9Xz0C0n.jpg&h=7b7d0741&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n誠懇呼籲唔好再舉美國旗，你唔係美國人又搞佢哋支旗，美國人會好反感<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/djateT\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/djateT</a><br />\n#1 回覆 - 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"}]}
