I come from East Berlin and partizipated in the uprising that ended the communist regime here. It was a nonviolent revolution, noone was killed despite all the guns on regimes side and we all have been very surprised when the regime suddenly collapsed, we expected to get shot. <br />\nI can really understand your situation and i feel with all the victims of the horrible police brutality.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Please allow me some suggestions.</span><br />\n<br />\n- loose fleeing crowds are easy prey for the raptors to single out protestors and beat them up, stay together and build chains, first rows hold together and shield and the rows behind can colorbomb and constructionfoam attacking raptors<br />\n<br />\n- you can not outgun the police, dont try to beat and hurt the policemen, dont use petrolbombs , a burned police will give them every excuse they want, you will loose support of the people and sympathie of the west<br />\n<br />\n- go for the gear, throw colorbombs at them, use oil color, use CONSTRUCTION FOAM! It will ruin their gear and blinding them, smearing their visors and shields, make their guns useless and not hurt them physically. A colorbombed or foamed policeman is out of business, he will have to retreat and change gear and ruin their cars on the way, this will make every police action extra expensive and he is out of the battle. You can reduce their numbers very effectively.<br />\nA colorbombed water cannon is blind.<br />\n<br />\nBe water<br />\n<br />\n可能未必個個認同<br />\n兄弟爬山 各自努力💪🏻"},{"pid":"c8321009bd4f3e35778d75ad371c07ed6bee1d4f","tid":1626466,"uid":261478,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-05T14:14:04.000Z","msg":"聽曰港島記住係和平遊行<br />\n盡量吸多D和理非出黎<br />\n和理非唔好怕無不反對通知書<br />\n香港已經唔講法律<br />\n有不反對通知書都照拉鳩你架啦<br />\n所以聽日為香港全世界出黎港島<br />\n勇和一家目標300萬人和平遊行<br />\n畀人知道香港人係和平嘅<br />\n暴力嘅係政府<br />\n要吸多D國際支持<br />\n<br />\n同時我唔反對衝衝子去衝<br />\n但記住要散水返左屋企先<br />\n避免畀狗圍無路走唔到<br />\n返左屋企之後再係屋企步行範圍內快閃游擊<br />\n拆鐵拆政府建築幫中資國企裝修<br />\n裝修到星期二開唔到門就變相三罷<br />\n唔好等有狗出現就要散水轉場<br />\n記住我地優勢係人多機動性高<br />\n攰同餓就返屋企食飯休息回滿升先再第日出過<br />\n有唔對路就返屋企訓覺唔好送頭<br />\n<br />\n幫手推POST<br />\n<a href=\"https://lihkg.com/thread/1626523/page/1\" target=\"_blank\">https://lihkg.com/thread/1626523/page/1</a>"}]}
