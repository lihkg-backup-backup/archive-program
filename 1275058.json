We did not want to embark on this path of resisting tyranny with our bare bodies, and using the occupation of the Hong Kong Legislative Council as our leverage; but for too long has our Government lied and deceived, and refused to respond to the demands of the people despite the numerous mass demonstrations of the past month. In face of this oppressive regime, we can only harness our sense of justice, our moral consciences, and our deep love for Hong Kong and its people.<br />\n<br />\nSince the establishment of the Hong Kong Government 22 years ago, political and economic conditions of the city have only grown worse. After Carrie Lam became Chief Executive, the situation has deteriorated drastically, and in blatant indifference to the will of millions, she has pushed the notorious &ldquo;Extradition Bill&rdquo;. Since early June, the people of Hong Kong have exhausted all other means&mdash;from peaceful protests to withstanding police violence&mdash;with the sole aim of demanding the Government to fully withdraw the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Ordinance. Yet the Government sees but does not respond; hears but does not care; the Government has chosen to set the people up as its enemy.<br />\n<br />\nThe current SAR government no longer acts in the interest of the people of Hong Kong. To compel the government to listen to its people, we as citizens have no choice but to carry out occupations, non-cooperative campaigns, and today, the occupation of the Legislative Council. Perhaps there are some who criticize our actions today; and yet, we ask, what is the root cause of our predicament? Why has society become so deeply divided? Why has public discontent only grown by the day? Why have the people of Hong Kong been forced to this point? We do not have arms, we are not violent; all we have are hearts that yearn for justice, and a fearless, courageous determination to go on. We hope that the Hong Kong government returns to the right path.<br />\n<br />\nWe, the protestors, demand the Government to meet the following:<br />\n1) Fully withdraw the Proposed Amendments<br />\n2) Rescind the characterization of the movement as a &ldquo;Riot&rdquo;<br />\n3) Drop all charges against anti-extradition protestors<br />\n4) Fully investigate and hold accountable abuses of power in the Hong Kong Police Force<br />\n5) Dissolve the Legislative Council, and implement Universal Suffrage<br />\nSince the beginning of the anti-extradition movement, three young citizens have already died. We remain in grief and rage, and yet we do not want to see more martyrs in Hong Kong&rsquo;s long struggle for democracy, freedom, and justice. We hope that society remains united, and join us in resisting the unjust bill, the oppressive government, and together, protect Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\n出處 Facebook: Shuk-ying Chan"},{"pid":"e7901406141a13fa25510e15251a9377198b82e9","tid":1275058,"uid":252193,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:03:01.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"556676ce7e35f8d7431ac3409f9f534402586f39","tid":1275058,"uid":262737,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:03:45.000Z","msg":"《香港宣言》中文版<br />\n<br />\n各位親愛的香港市民：<br />\n<br />\n我們是一群來自民間的示威者。今天，我們捨身成仁，決定進佔香港特區政府立法會。<br />\n<br />\n市民於6月起進行多次示威活動，當中更包括二百萬遊行，懇求希望政府撤回修例，而政府置若岡聞，不諳民情，竟置香港大眾、民意於不顧，甚至以民為敵。<br />\n<br />\n現任特區政府已非港人所願，所承認，立法會選舉制度更無法表達民意，尤以功能組別為甚，純淪為政治工具，所以我們不得不進行各種佔領，不合作、乃至今日進佔立法會行動。<br />\n<br />\n我們佔領者，現在政府立法會，正式宣讀五大訴求：<br />\n<br />\n一、徹底撤回修例<br />\n二、收回暴動定義<br />\n三、撤銷對今後及之前為所有反送中抗爭者控罪<br />\n四、徹底追究警隊濫權情況，設立獨立調查委員會<br />\n<br />\n最後我們覺得問題的根源，是香港人仍然沒有立法會及行政長官的全面普選，所以我們要求<br />\n<br />\n五、2020年立法會全面普選<br />\n<br />\n「反送中運動」發展至今，有三位年輕市民殉道。我們心繫家園，付出身軀只是想守護我家。我等未忘憂憤，然心存善念，不願香港再有為民主、為自由、為公義再添亡魂。希望社會大眾團結一致，對抗惡法，對抗暴政，共同守護香港。"},{"pid":"edf0b3b3a7cf734316cd2b54e11bd9352986bb4c","tid":1275058,"uid":28068,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:04:10.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"096f73f843deb04671e930156ce6e3fd9a0550de","tid":1275058,"uid":262737,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:07:38.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"db09c5c90ab605b36306f84c90ddcbc772459b2e","tid":1275058,"uid":259675,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:09:47.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f9de4feb54af7a3ec50801061eb93e3403852410","tid":1275058,"uid":260035,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:11:24.000Z","msg":"推比文宣組"},{"pid":"3ed48113464f913c013918050a1ef04b0a43ebcc","tid":1275058,"uid":260035,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:11:34.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a90dcec710e5bb68dde3c48a180e13e215dbf426","tid":1275058,"uid":66324,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:18:31.000Z","msg":"中英唔同喎 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"193dfefdfb24bb7bb8760eb372418709d0099f05","tid":1275058,"uid":262737,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a90dcec710e5bb68dde3c48a180e13e215dbf426","tid":1275058,"uid":66324,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:18:31.000Z","msg":"中英唔同喎 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:20:13.000Z","msg":"我懷疑我post錯中文版<br />\n係咪我果份中文版唔update？<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a9c71a67ea4e3fb7eaaf8b5803dfbf140e1e2fb8","tid":1275058,"uid":261773,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:21:36.000Z","msg":"Pish"},{"pid":"44de74acea3df962256139d866f01f227382db04","tid":1275058,"uid":267718,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T18:45:31.000Z","msg":"呢堆垃圾冇料到。Princeton 咁教你做 presentation 嘅咩。<br />\n<br />\n兩個版本都冇乜事實。一堆意見。你話 extradition bill 係 notorious 就係架啦。你要解釋點解唔好。因為將香港法律同大陸法律連埋。香港法庭又冇能力把關。所以係 notorious。但係你解咗就唔使講呢條法律係 notorious。係人都知渠 notorious 架啦。你同林鄭一樣。當人白癡。不斷畀人意見。冇啲事實。點說服人呀。<br />\n<br />\n另外你呢封信係畀邊個睇先。香港人就唔使你講咁多野。又唔一定要有英文版。如果係畀外國人睇。咁又解釋得唔夠。同埋你目的係乜先。你想個讀者有乜反應。最後。你係咪應該唔好寫港式英文呢。<br />\n<br />\n奉勸你最好聽下肥彭喺 youtube 啲發言。又精簡又一針見血。而且講事實講道理。冇句煽情。搞好你個腦先學人出黎講野啦。"}]}
