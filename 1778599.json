While we assessed that meaningful progress had been made in data collection and analysis, we ultimately concluded that a crucial shortfall was evident in the powers, capacity and independent investigative capability of IPCC. Given the scale and complexity of events subject to its Thematic Study, we determined that addressing at least the capacity and investigative capability shortfalls, would be necessary in order for the IPCC to begin to meet the standards citizens of Hong Kong would be likely to require of a police watchdog operating in a society that values freedoms and rights. Since then, dialogue with the IPCC has not led to any agreed process through which the IEP would be able to effectively support the Thematic Study any further at this stage. As a result, the IEP has taken the decision to formally stand aside from its role. As a group we remain committed to supporting and engaging with the IPCC, if and when it develops the necessary capabilities and provides its draft interim report on the protests, confrontations and policing of events between June and September 2019."},{"pid":"2f40ed30943c51a101b222c2e0ba3f41e55db56e","tid":1778599,"uid":278765,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-11T05:38:17.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/foreign-panel-steps-down-from-probe-of-hong-kong-police-11576018800\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fforeign-panel-steps-down-from-probe-of-hong-kong-police-11576018800&d=doP1hY1jTMShcZ7HAjrDwm%2FWCCUevL1oElw8znUqpaw%3D&h=92a00425\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/foreign-panel-steps-down-from-probe-of-hong-kong-police-11576018800</a><br />\n<br />\nForeign Panel Steps Down From Probe of Hong Kong Police<br />\n<br />\nGroup says city&rsquo;s watchdog lacks powers to properly investigate use of force against protesters<br />\n<br />\nHONG KONG&mdash;A panel of foreign experts recruited to ensure the objectivity of an investigation into allegations of excessive force by Hong Kong police during recent protests said it was stepping down after their concerns about the probe went unresolved, a step likely to fuel criticism of the review.<br />\nThe panel said the body tasked with the probe lacks the powers and investigative capabilities &ldquo;necessary&hellip;to begin to meet the standards citizens of Hong Kong would likely require of a police watchdog operating in a society that values freedoms and rights.&rdquo;<br />\nThe foremost demand of protesters in Hong Kong has been the establishment of a judge-led commission to investigate&nbsp;how police have handled the demonstrations&nbsp;that have&nbsp;gripped the city&nbsp;for half a year. Hong Kong&rsquo;s government has said that the city&rsquo;s police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council, must complete its own review first.<br />\nThe IPCC has said it would produce a report in early 2020 that will enable the Hong Kong police and government &ldquo;to take the next steps necessary to bring Hong Kong forward into an era of enduring peace and harmony under our constitutional system.&rdquo;<br />\nWhile the IPCC is responsible for oversight of the Commissioner of Police&rsquo;s handling and investigation of reportable complaints against the force, it can&rsquo;t summon witnesses or compel police to provide evidence. Public complaints must be filed with the police before they are then passed on to the IPCC.<br />\nThe panel of foreign experts was invited by the council to ensure the objectivity of the council&rsquo;s investigation, the IPCC said in August.&nbsp;A statement by the panel released in November&nbsp;questioned the IPCC&rsquo;s ability to conduct independent investigations into policing practices, given the scale of events in Hong Kong and the council&rsquo;s restrictions on collecting and validating evidence.<br />\n<br />\nThe IPCC said at the time that it was disappointed in the publication of the statement on Twitter, as it had wanted its members to see the document first. It said it would give full consideration to the matters addressed in the document.<br />\nEarly Wednesday in Hong Kong, the panel said it decided to formally stand aside after discussions with the IPCC failed to establish a process in which it could effectively support the study. Anthony Neoh, a barrister and former chairman of the city&rsquo;s Securities and Futures Commission&mdash;who heads the IPCC&mdash;said in a statement that the council has noted it doesn&rsquo;t have the investigative power under the current circumstances, which is why it solicited support from the city&rsquo;s leader and the police commissioner for the study.<br />\n<br />\nNevertheless [the IPCC has to progress this initiative within the present IPCC Ordinance with a view to offer improvement recommendations to the police and assist the examination of related complaint cases,&rdquo; he said.<br />\nThe IPCC said it would liaise with the panel of experts after publishing its first interim report.<br />\nPanel member Clifford Stott, a social-psychology professor at Britain&rsquo;s Keele University researching public-order policing, said he believes the IPCC can play a role in resolving the current situation only if it is given the powers the panel recommends as basic requirements, such as significantly improving its ability to identify and secure evidence from witnesses both inside and outside the police force.<br />\nThe study &ldquo;must have credibility to the citizens of Hong Kong, since it is unclear if the Chinese or Hong Kong governments would support the formation of a more powerful Commission of Inquiry,&rdquo; Mr. Stott said.<br />\nA strengthened IPCC could be the closest the Hong Kong government can get to the kind of independent inquiry that many people in Hong Kong demand, he said."},{"pid":"abf69b3b37dddf31e816bc96293f724f50d6e75b","tid":1778599,"uid":35456,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-11T05:40:18.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"359d3af2d8ff881bef2990172be8177581e39c45","tid":1778599,"uid":278765,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-11T05:45:04.000Z","msg":"真係要讚呀吳志森，今次出得好快！！！<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/c8PD1Xdd-aU\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fc8PD1Xdd-aU&d=doP1hY1jTMShcZ7HAjrDwm%2FWCCUevL1oElw8znUqpaw%3D&h=f626f987\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/c8PD1Xdd-aU</a>"},{"pid":"7aa7321c769f70f5776d4e96dc5ee56a13ddd0ca","tid":1778599,"uid":175659,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-11T05:49:02.000Z","msg":"死雞撐飯蓋"},{"pid":"6bb66a4ce7be9304ec1ef2d6e0114eb59d241146","tid":1778599,"uid":249263,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-11T05:49:36.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"color: red;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">美加議員講對華政策，<br />\n響task2 急要人</span></span><br />\n適逢人權日，世界上人權被打壓嘅國家或地區唔少，當然其中一個亮點係打壓緊香港同新疆嘅中國！<br />\n<br />\n多國政要發推文關注中國打壓人權嘅情況，精選推文遍布task 1 &amp;
