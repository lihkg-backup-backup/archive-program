Television, radio, and film are the most productive forms of communication among all different combinations. This essay will, regarding their effectiveness, discuss both advantages &amp; disadvantages of these media.<br />\n<br />\nTelevision is one of the must-have home appliances. The widely broadcast content, deliver with motion picture and sounds, are the most comprehensive and primary resources of information for every family. The only weakness is that the audience must have to sit tight in front of the screen in order to receive the full context. The viewer will get lost to a TV drama by hearing the dialogue without watching the scene when you are away from the television, say, kitchen.<br />\n<br />\nRadio has a unique attribute which allows the audience to receive the messages by only hearing. It is the most popular media for workers who can keep doing their task while listening to the radio programmes. On the downsides, the absence of the body and visual language leads to inaccurate delivery of the content and relies on the imagination of the listener.<br />\n<br />\nFilm condenses long story which cost lesser time for the audience to read the plot. With the help of cinematography and audio design, the messages are present in a higher dimension compared to the other media. However, film has its limitation as a unilateral communication media. There is no interaction between the audiences and the storytellers hence no further details could be asked or clarified.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough these three media have different disadvantages, the advantages are overall better than the rest in transmitting messages. And I believe that television, radio, and film will still among the highest efficiency of the communication media in the future.<br />\n<br />\n求狠批！<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/ass.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n另求網站推介，想睇下d 文章點寫世界大小事（非政經）"},{"pid":"9964d263ccf5edd4a7adbeb74b209523aaa417a6","tid":805386,"uid":201761,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-03T18:42:13.000Z","msg":"[quote]偷左隔離 post 條題（因為未見過呢個類型）<br />\n寫左差唔多成個鐘 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n今次用d 簡單字，冇跟出面d template<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Compare the advantages and disadvantages of three of the following as media for communicating information.

answer 都好似冇 ...<br />\n<br />\nModel Answer 1:<br />\nIn our daily life, we communicate information through lots of different media like the internet, televisions, radios, books, cell phones, films etc. We are living in such a time when information is one of the most important issues and the information technologies as well as the communication media greatly influence our lives. The rapid-growing websites and TV channels are many of few little examples how media are spreading to make information easily accessible. All the media for information interchange have advantages and disadvantages and not all can attract all types of audiences. Comics, books, radios, televisions, film and theatre are all very powerful media for communicating information. In my opinion books, televisions and film among those aforementioned six media are most effective.<br />\n<br />\nBooks are the witness of history and the main source from which we gain knowledge. From a very ancient period till now, books have been working as the light-house for our society. In our childhood, we gather most of our knowledge and skills from books. It opens new horizons in front of us. The writer writes down their experiences, imaginations, knowledge, explanation etc. about each and every issue of our lives. Books are the long-lasting protocol to make a bridge among writers and readers.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, all are not happy to read books. They expect something easier and more vivid. Music, radios, films etc. are more appealing to them. Television is another powerful media. Watching television is a part of our daily lives. Most of the people who have a TV set, watch programs, news etc. with apt attention. It is a strong medium for Government and other organisations to send their messages to the mass population. Program representatives also broadcast the people's view and opinions about different controversial issues in TV programs. However, this medium has lots of demerits and bad impacts. Government and politically biased organisations often send negative and misleading news. Again young people watch different satellite channels and try to adopt the alien culture which is really harmful for the culture and tradition of a country.<br />\n<br />\nFilms are an audio-visual representation and can catch the attention of people from different geographical locations, races and cultures. A good film can shape someone's morality and doctrine and the film-makers with their huge amount of money, are so careful to make their films realistic and eye-absorbing. Every film has a direct or potential message or moral. On the contrary, some films also bring a wrong message to us. For example, protagonists are always smoking in the films and it seems that smoking is a good and smart habit. It causes many younger people imitate them smoking.<br />\n<br />\nIn conclusion, I would like to state that books, televisions and films are the most powerful and effective medias for communicating information."},{"pid":"17d08ac4da7f556a0ef039c165a3422c8724d87b","tid":805386,"uid":199016,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-04T04:45:25.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"8ba842a8b5ce87363bd612847e8094d576823713","tid":805386,"uid":194415,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-04T04:45:42.000Z","msg":"Model Answer 2:<br />\nCommunication media plays a vital role in today&rsquo;s world.

Other channels, such as Star movies, telecast movies throughout the day.<br />\n<br />\nA radio is an electronic device that uses microwave communication to send and receive information.
