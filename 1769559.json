Lee suffered from heart disease and was scheduled to have an angioplasty surgery. <br />\nThe last message Lee left on Nov 24, before he was admitted to the hospital: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having difficulty breathing after breathing in tear gas. The worst thing is that I can&rsquo;t sleep. I&rsquo;ve already seen my family doctor and been taking antibiotics for several days. However, the medication doesn&rsquo;t work. I had mung beans syrup and chrysanthemum tea today and yesterday night. I feel a little bit better now. Could you guys recommend more home remedies to me? CUHK&rsquo;s vice chancellor Rocky Tuan stayed in the hospital for 6 days. It might be caused by toxicities of tear gas!&rdquo; //  <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Sources from Real Hong Kong News Facebook account<br />\n</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLee&rsquo;s last message quoted by his friend: <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/100034948083687/posts/188161682358767?d=n&amp;sfns=mo\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F100034948083687%2Fposts%2F188161682358767%3Fd%3Dn%26sfns%3Dmo&d=nBH2CsHB%2BCaOzcOtxJw1e%2BPMooGStKW6IyA4tNg2jBs%3D&h=64a3542e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/100034948083687/posts/188161682358767?d=n&amp;sfns=mo</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDuring the past six months of political movements in Hong Kong, there have been about 10000 canisters of teargas have been fired by &ldquo;popo&rdquo; across almost every districts.<br />\n<br />\nUntil now, the government has claimed that there is no evidence to show any harm to major public health and environmental safety.
