The launch had a one-second window because of the precision needed for the satellite insertion, according to company spokesperson John Insprucker said during the broadcast. The launch went smoothly, despite the fact that fog obscured the view of the rocket until after lift-off.<br />\n<br />\nSpaceX hoped to complete two separate marine tasks in addition to the launch itself: landing the first stage of the rocket on the droneship &quot;Just Read the Instructions&quot; and catching the rocket's fairing with a second boat, which to date, no launch launch has accomplished. The company knew both boat maneuvers would be tricky today. &quot;The weather in the Pacific is bad,&quot; Insprucker said. &quot;We have choppy seas.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;[The conditions are] the worst that we've ever had for trying to get a first stage on the droneship,&quot; he continued later in the broadcast. Nevertheless, the company soon confirmed in a tweet that the rocket successfully landed on the droneship &mdash; despite some initial confusion due to a lack of lighting on the landing platform.<br />\n<br />\nSpectators had hoped the company would attempt to catch the rocket's fairing with &quot;Mr Steven,&quot; its boat equipped with a giant net. Earlier in July, the company tweeted photos of the boat with an upgraded net four times larger than the previous version and stated that it was targeting another recovery attempt for later in the month, and today's launch was the company's last of the month.<br />\n<br />\nSpaceX was not able to specify at launch when it would know whether Mr. Steven was successful, but a later update confirmed the weather was too harsh for the maneuver. &quot;They did see the payload fairing coming down, but they were not able to catch it in the net,&quot; Insprucker announced shortly after 8:30 a.m. EDT. <br />\n<br />\nThe Iridium satellites were scheduled to deploy about an hour after launch and were on target for a smooth deployment after the cruise phase of the launch. They will bring the constellation up to 75 satellites, which with ten additional units meant to launch later this year will run tracking procedures on devices connected to the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).<br />\n<br />\nToday's launch followed a launch from the opposite coast on Sunday and will be followed by a third launch currently scheduled for Aug. 2."},{"pid":"0a3aff1bfcd75d61e444f71503f94ab69bdcb991","tid":755806,"uid":2102,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T13:18:04.000Z","msg":"Block 5<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/09.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/06.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"9ccc4958e3abbab2a76c3838f523ab033a62c2fb","tid":755806,"uid":66943,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T13:19:27.000Z","msg":"fuck<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e934fa48cd855d8baa4ae0c4a6662417f0aa5ee4","tid":755806,"uid":83623,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T13:38:13.000Z","msg":"好大frog<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e48d43d3416852b236ea8d91e6c4b7472148e3e0","tid":755806,"uid":3068,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-26T05:04:32.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://img.eservice-hk.net/upload/2018/07/26/130421_180fb4064fecc115f92e97d926ac780a.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.eservice-hk.net%2Fupload%2F2018%2F07%2F26%2F130421_180fb4064fecc115f92e97d926ac780a.png&h=f41211c1&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7ec1c2b11dd7a287d1949b2c9d1fab3a5d888cfe","tid":755806,"uid":38973,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-26T05:30:18.000Z","msg":"加大四倍唔得，就加大8倍<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/06.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"86153472f54ae52ee13b7c211fe4a2431c630862","tid":755806,"uid":120678,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"e48d43d3416852b236ea8d91e6c4b7472148e3e0","tid":755806,"uid":3068,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-26T05:04:32.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://img.eservice-hk.net/upload/2018/07/26/130421_180fb4064fecc115f92e97d926ac780a.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.eservice-hk.net%2Fupload%2F2018%2F07%2F26%2F130421_180fb4064fecc115f92e97d926ac780a.png&h=f41211c1&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-26T07:53:34.000Z","msg":"咩網來的？<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7475bffe74d190ece9f84a3315d8bf9c86adfb7e","tid":755806,"uid":41818,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-26T08:13:46.000Z","msg":"聽講係最重？"}]}
