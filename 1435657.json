I believe that your company is well aware of the unrest that is currently predominating the society. In recent months, the tear gas bullet (Model No. MP-6M5-CS-HKP) and tear gas canister (together, the &quot;TG&quot;), fired by the Hong Kong Police towards protestors, was found to have expired, as far back as in 2016. <br />\n<br />\nI have noticed, from the photos of TG available online that they were manufactured by your company.<br />\n<br />\nThe use of TG has becoming a routine in Hong Kong and residents of various district were exposed to the hazardous gas, while sitting at home (i.e., some were at the age of 2 or below). <br />\n<br />\nWhile I understand that CS gas originally may cause damage to liver and heart, I am deeply concerned about whether there may be changes in the chemical components of CS when it was expired, leading to a more disastrous and irreversible effect on human body. <br />\n<br />\nAs the manufacturer, I trust that you have the most knowledge and understanding over your own products and therefore is well equipped to answer the above questions. <br />\n<br />\nAccordingly, I would be appreciated if your company can revert and clarify the below:<br />\n<br />\n1. Potential side effect/effect of expired TG on the environment and more importantly, the human body;<br />\n2. The instruction and regulation overseeing the use and handling of TG; <br />\n3. Manual of the above if possible; and<br />\n4. any other information you believe should be shared to all citizen of Hong Kong, shall they, in the future, be exposed to the gas, passively. <br />\n<br />\nplease also find attached photos of the TG recovered on the internet for your ease reference.<br />\n<br />\nI would be appreciate if you could revert or maybe issue a statement shortly.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nYours faithfully,<br />\n<br />\nA deeply concern citizen of Hong Kong<br />\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br />\n<br />\n坐係屋企都可能會死既現在，自己條命自己救<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a15520f3b9d9eead6538062c768d16c7e0333d59","tid":1435657,"uid":38381,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-09T06:07:41.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/whip_special.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f683301493e10807b3a36c1f1513df08ae569e54","tid":1435657,"uid":15897,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-09T11:48:38.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"ddab25b2adf4be746edd645c1a4cd93e1d5eac80","tid":1435657,"uid":231480,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-09T11:49:56.000Z","msg":"仲有英法德等歐洲國家<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
