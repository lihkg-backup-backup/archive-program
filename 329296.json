Traffic Congestion among the three road harbour crossing is a case of it. Critics have long been arguing the overspend on HKZMB pose a tremendous threat to public fund with tiny benefits gained by the community. Before we examine the construction of HKZMB a bless or a curse , it is of paramount importance for us to investigate what the government have already been doing in a bid to eradicate the current cramped road and overwhelmed traffic..<br />\n  To commence with, the government has put forward an array of recommendation on the Highway construction and expansion works such as Hiram's highway improvement work, widening of the Fanning highway and Island East Corridor Link. These huge infrastructural works has greatly received by the community. Upon commissioning of these construction, it can reduce the travel time in rush hours ,alleviate the proliferating traffic flow and also provide a better delivery of a comprehensive traffic road net. It can also bring significant impact to the boost of job opportunity during the construction period and pose a great advantage to logistics and tourism upon completion.<br />\n  Furthermore, as regards traffic distribution among the three road harbour crossing, the current-term government has already commenced a feasibility study on traffic distribution to formulate toll adjustment mechanism in harbour crossing road. Also, a territory-wide consultation and review on the electronic road pricing scheme are in progress."},{"pid":"00abe4e4272fbc4a54d13aca27beccca0d9e2499","tid":329296,"uid":71061,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-20T09:34:57.000Z","msg":"Section fares instead of
