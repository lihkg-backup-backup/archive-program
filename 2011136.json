Since the Warring States period, the Qin Kingdom Shangyang Reform has been particularly strict with the people. Since the household registration system is still in use, the CCP has reached its peak. So called &quot;leader of the neighborhood&quot;, high-definition lens recognition, and social credit system.  The national portrait lives under the spotlight, everything is visible, all dissatisfied with the social elements, especially the pro-democracy activists, are suppressed and punished.<br />\n          Now that the Chinese Communist Party is running out of foreign currency, it is preparing to launch a digital currency. The people's wallets are immediately exposed. The gold and silver jewelry hidden by the corrupt officials in the dungeons can never be used for cash.  The government knows what food, clothes, even books and magazines the people have bought, and any gatherings. The people&rsquo;s emotions and dissatisfaction with the society will be targeted by government officials.  With such strict monitoring, can the regime last forever?  After the reunification of the six countries, strong Qin can only last for 15 years. The Wuhan pneumonia, which the CCP has committed itself, is a global scourge. The CCP is trapped in isolation and siege, its resources have dried up, and inflation has intensified.
