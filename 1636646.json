The police has called for people to leave public gathering immediately. <br />\n</blockquote>"},{"pid":"0ac4bfd60bb20b72d290108ad2d7d120dbdcb8d4","tid":1636646,"uid":23170,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-07T20:42:50.000Z","msg":"I really need to sleep before I turn into a zombie tomorrow, please take over anyone who may accidentally read this post.

Po Lam, Hang Hau, Tseung Kwan O, and Tiu Keng Leng. The distance between each station is not too far, each station is within ten minutes walk away from one another. If brothers are taking on the MTR stations they could go straight to one after one. <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />(Even though all the stations have been done with already<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />)<br />\n<br />\nSecondly, Tseung Kwan O brothers would know about this, the whole Tseung Kwan O is filled with shopping centres, 3 in Po Lam, 5 in Hang Hau, around 4 in Tseung Kwan O but I am uncertain with that, 3 in Tiu Keng Leng. <br />\nWhat is the characteristic in this? <span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\">All the shopping centres amongst the stations are connected！</span></span>All of them lead back to housing estates!

Those small local stores would not be as highly affected.<br />\n<br />\nFifthly, If Popo does not have enough people and needed for back ups, there is only one way into Tseung Kwan O, which is the Tseung Kwan O Tunnel (only if the popo is insane to the point they would take hiking path) And do you know what is next to Tseung Kwan O tunnel? Yes, they are again housing estates, the Tsui Lam Estate. Tsui Lam Estate's brothers would see popo cars coming in from Tseung Kwan O tunnel and report immediately!

He was exactly visiting the anti-terrorism training facility, and mentioned that it was worth learning from after returning to Hong Kong (ref. 4). Just before the sentence was finished, in January, 2019 Kong Nga Po has a new Xinjiang Ling anti-terrorism base planning being put onto Legco for funds. <br />\n<br />\nOur researchers have even found that as early as in July, 2016 (ref.5), Hong Kong police has already had a 4 days long in-depth exchange and learning program with the Xinjiang authority. Especially on &ldquo;Emergency responsive strategy in order to improve the quality of prison management&ldquo;, they have proudly uploaded photos onto Facebook. <br />\n<br />\nAt the end, we would leave to you to think whether they are relocating the experience in Xinjiang into New Territory or not. <br />\n<br />\n--Why no one knows about this?--<br />\n<br />\nIt is not without reason that this plan has now been known by many. Because the government is good at playing with procedures, the entire project has been stuffed into the HKD 33.5 billion North-east New Territory funding, causing the media to focus onto forceful removal of villages and Real Estate tycoon disputes, where this Xinjiang Ling anti-terrorism base has been largely neglected.<br />\n<br />\nThe government has also learnt to put the description of anti-terrorism base in footnotes, making the font size hardly noticeable, when everyone is focusing on Anti-ELAB movement this May, they have easily took the fund of 1.9 billion to flatten the field. The bidding documents indicate that this November the developers would start working. (ref. 6)<br />\n<br />\nNow, only just the land flattening in pre-development phase cost 1.9 billion, we are talking about an anti-terrorism standard of police facility, the estimate cost could be more than 10 billions at the end with no surprise. Till now, the cost for anti-terrorism base facility has no specific estimation, they are expecting after the land is flattened they could force into having the development fund for facility as well. <br />\n<br />\n--Rejecting the Xingjiang Ling--<br />\n<br />\nRight now, police force is using citizens on street around 18 districts as their shooting target training, playing vehicle drifting on crossroad, all sort of gun weapons have been trained already, there is definitely no need for a training base like this. Only thing is that killing weapons like the water cannon vehicles, sound wave blast cannon vehicles, if a remote area has been designated for them to practice insanely, their lethal force would not just be the level we see today. Therefore this tens of billion dollars anti-terrorist facility that will be used to abusecitizens must be opposed.<br />\n<br />\nIf the anti-terrorism base has no need and the land has been flattened already, the most practical resolution is to move the 18 Hectares Wong Chuk Hang police training school into there. Emptying an urban area for other land use, it is estimated that it could contain 1.3 (sic) residential unit to solve housing problem (ref. 7) The area in Hung Lung Hang should be reserved for Special Tactical Squad, otherwise they should not let them to develop anything there. <br />\n<br />\nto be continued again <br />\n</blockquote>"},{"pid":"57ea31906b22b4eb349074e3d7ee8f503d8ace50","tid":1636646,"uid":23170,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"7895206ffc0bc06e9050ccb9b1df5a64a8b6838d","tid":1636646,"uid":23170,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"f439279c940f644ddf7f31f7ed242533ccb562d0","tid":1636646,"uid":23170,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T04:12:54.000Z","msg":"【新屋嶺已停用 但隔離「新疆嶺」即將啟用!】<br />\n<a href=\"https://lihkg.com/thread/1637196/page/1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lihkg.com/thread/1637196/page/1</a><br />\n<br />\nTopic: [San UK Ling has already been out of use, but the next up &ldquo; Xinjiang Ling&ldquo; will come in play soon]<br />\nXinjiang Ling 新疆嶺 is a Cantonese word play on San Uk Ling 新屋嶺<br />\nSan Uk Ling, a holding centre in remote area that has been reported to have many inhumane acts imposed by police on arrested protesters. <br />\n<br />\n<blockquote> [San UK Ling has already been out of use, but the next up &ldquo; Xinjiang Ling&ldquo; will come in play soon]<br />\n<br />\nIt has come to very few attention, the government has taken 1.9 billion HKD fund at the beginning of anti-ELAB movement on a new facility that is 10 - 15 times bigger than San Uk Ling which focuses on anti-terrorism.

Would the facility within this be oriented like the &ldquo;re-education camp&ldquo; in Xinjiang? OR another New Territory version of &ldquo;Guantanamo Bay detention camp&ldquo;, an isolated extrajudicial ground? <br />\n<br />\n*****to be continued<br />\n</blockquote>"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T04:45:36.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><br />\n--New territory into Xinjiang?--<br />\n(again, there is a small word play in this)<br />\n<br />\nBring back to December, 2018 when the Secretary for Security, John Lee, was visiting the Xinjiang anti-terrorism facility for field study. He was exactly visiting the anti-terrorism training facility, and mentioned that it was worth learning from after returning to Hong Kong (ref. 4). Just before the sentence was finished, in January, 2019 Kong Nga Po has a new Xinjiang Ling anti-terrorism base planning being put onto Legco for funds. <br />\n<br />\nOur researchers have even found that as early as in July, 2016 (ref.5), Hong Kong police has already had a 4 days long in-depth exchange and learning program with the Xinjiang authority. Especially on &ldquo;Emergency responsive strategy in order to improve the quality of prison management&ldquo;, they have proudly uploaded photos onto Facebook. <br />\n<br />\nAt the end, we would leave to you to think whether they are relocating the experience in Xinjiang into New Territory or not. <br />\n<br />\n--Why no one knows about this?--<br />\n<br />\nIt is not without reason that this plan has now been known by many. Because the government is good at playing with procedures, the entire project has been stuffed into the HKD 33.5 billion North-east New Territory funding, causing the media to focus onto forceful removal of villages and Real Estate tycoon disputes, where this Xinjiang Ling anti-terrorism base has been largely neglected.<br />\n<br />\nThe government has also learnt to put the description of anti-terrorism base in footnotes, making the font size hardly noticeable, when everyone is focusing on Anti-ELAB movement this May, they have easily took the fund of 1.9 billion to flatten the field. The bidding documents indicate that this November the developers would start working. (ref. 6)<br />\n<br />\nNow, only just the land flattening in pre-development phase cost 1.9 billion, we are talking about an anti-terrorism standard of police facility, the estimate cost could be more than 10 billions at the end with no surprise. Till now, the cost for anti-terrorism base facility has no specific estimation, they are expecting after the land is flattened they could force into having the development fund for facility as well. <br />\n<br />\n--Rejecting the Xingjiang Ling--<br />\n<br />\nRight now, police force is using citizens on street around 18 districts as their shooting target training, playing vehicle drifting on crossroad, all sort of gun weapons have been trained already, there is definitely no need for a training base like this. Only thing is that killing weapons like the water cannon vehicles, sound wave blast cannon vehicles, if a remote area has been designated for them to practice insanely, their lethal force would not just be the level we see today. Therefore this tens of billion dollars anti-terrorist facility that will be used to abusecitizens must be opposed.<br />\n<br />\nIf the anti-terrorism base has no need and the land has been flattened already, the most practical resolution is to move the 18 Hectares Wong Chuk Hang police training school into there. Emptying an urban area for other land use, it is estimated that it could contain 1.3 (sic) residential unit to solve housing problem (ref. 7) The area in Hung Lung Hang should be reserved for Special Tactical Squad, otherwise they should not let them to develop anything there. <br />\n<br />\nto be continued again <br />\n</blockquote>"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-08T04:49:21.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><br />\nIn reality, Xinjiang has fallen to its current state with concentration camp, it is all according to the White Paper for Xinjiang issued by the State Council of the People's Republic of China (ref. 8).

Therefore to prevent Hong Kong from taking to this step of &ldquo;preventive measures for anti-terrorism&ldquo;, is to prevent the government from intruding Hong Kong using the name of anti-terrorism. <br />\n<br />\nIf to stop the violent abuses of the police force, then the anti-terrorism base project must be opposed, to give it an effective strike.
