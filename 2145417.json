It should be obvious to and resented by many people, locally and around the world, that the US acts are displaying double standards and hypocrisy, let alone blatantly breaching international laws and basic norms governing international relations. <br />\n      <br />\n     &quot;Hong Kong is an inalienable part of the PRC. Upholding and implementing the principle of 'One Country, Two Systems' meets the interests of Hong Kong people and represents the shared aspiration of all Chinese people. <br />\n      <br />\n     &quot;We have reminded the US ad nauseam of relevant provisions in the Basic Law, particularly Article 12 which stipulates that the HKSAR is a local administrative region of the PRC, which shall enjoy a high degree of autonomy and come directly under the Central People's Government; that the Constitution of the PRC and the Basic Law of the HKSAR form the constitutional basis of the HKSAR. Unfortunately, all these have fallen on deaf ears.<br />\n<br />\n     &quot;The US Government's claim that the imposition of the so-called 'sanctions' was in response to the enactment of the National Security Law in Hong Kong is a lame excuse that could hardly stand up to challenge."},{"pid":"0cf15a81584f76e675e17cdc40ecd0ffc57e34fd","tid":2145417,"uid":89517,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-08T04:49:50.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8d1e3bb5cd310596c005ee78aed42607fe52b905","tid":2145417,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-08T04:50:05.000Z","msg":"&quot;National security is a matter of utmost importance to any state, including the US. Laws governing national security are matters for the central government, regardless of whether it is a unitary or federal system of government. Enforcement of national security is likewise under the purview of the central authorities. The National Security Law enacted on June 30, 2020 by the National People's Congress Standing Committee fulfils all these general features and in recognition of the HKSAR's special status, authorises the HKSAR Government to be the main enforcement party. Article 4 of the National Security Law specifies that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR and the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents under the Basic Law as well as the provisions in international covenants as applied to Hong Kong shall be protected in accordance with the law.<br />\n      <br />\n     &quot;These legal provisions, coupled with the rule of law and an independent judiciary in the HKSAR, are clearly ignored by relevant US officials who have chosen to make unsubstantiated and sweeping comments to serve their own interest.&quot;<br />\n       <br />\n     The spokesman said that the escalating violence, anarchy and social chaos last June obviously required Police to fulfill their statutory duty to take lawful measures to maintain public order and public safety. This is no different to the solemn duty and responsibility of any Police Force in the world to protect life and property.  <br />\n     <br />\n    <strong><span class=\"red\"> The spokesman severely condemned the US Government for deliberately making public the personal information of Government officials.<br />\n      <br />\n     &quot;Such a deplorable move is no less than state-sanctioned doxxing that is a serious breach of privacy and personal safety. We reserve the right to take any necessary legal action,&quot; the spokesman said.<br />\n      <br />\n     &quot;We will fully support the Central Government to adopt counter-measures.</span></strong><br />\n      <br />\n     &quot;In an article published yesterday (August 7), Mr Yang Jiechi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, urged the US side to bear in mind the fundamental interests of the Chinese and American people and the whole world, and strengthen engagement, dialogue and communication.<br />\n      <br />\n     &quot;The HKSAR Government much regrets that the US Government's latest move on the so-called 'sanctions' against our senior officials is an utterly disrespectful attempt which will undermine Hong Kong-US relations at various levels. <br />\n      <br />\n    <strong><span class=\"red\"> &quot;Speaking on behalf of her senior colleagues who are being targeted, the Chief Executive Mrs Carrie Lam said that we are discharging an honourable duty to safeguard national security, protecting the life and interests of not only the 7.5 million Hong Kong people but also the 1.4 billion Mainlanders.
