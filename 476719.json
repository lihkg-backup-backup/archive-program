Today, VTM News reported that the ruling is in, and the answer is yes.<br />\nThe Google translation is a little sloppy, as usual, but the message is clear enough. &quot;The mixing of money and addiction is gambling,&quot; the Gaming Commission declared. Belgium's Minister of Justice Koen Geens also weighed in, saying, &quot;Mixing gambling and gaming, especially at a young age, is dangerous for the mental health of the child.&quot; <br />\n<br />\nGeens, according to the report, wants to ban in-game purchases outright (correction: if you don't know exactly what you're purchasing), and not just in Belgium: He said the process will take time, &quot;because we have to go to Europe. We will certainly try to ban it.&quot; <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/belgium-says-loot-boxes-are-gambling-wants-them-banned-in-europe/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcgamer.com%2Fbelgium-says-loot-boxes-are-gambling-wants-them-banned-in-europe%2F&d=zHqKsc4XsIYGQJODhmHhQ1zEg0sy7MJ6GkP0ogsbSqo%3D&h=44508e77\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pcgamer.com/belgium-says-loot-boxes-are-gambling-wants-them-banned-in-europe/</a>"},{"pid":"8d6c9cdca1b8df54a63351777f5d24f11d02c31b","tid":476719,"uid":46323,"like":1,"dislike":2,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-22T09:08:17.000Z","msg":"支持EA"},{"pid":"baf54fa523322b87314e2567b245c134ac73020a","tid":476719,"uid":46323,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-22T09:11:35.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"fcb470b0f298c8d215fa0e0ab1e6b6ef2c2c18de","tid":476719,"uid":46323,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-22T09:16:06.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/chicken.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b188507ca8a67c7c6d3c472992cf2c4007750b0f","tid":476719,"uid":46323,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-22T09:39:56.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6ac3e41927d6d7a26e5efbe65dee1aa1ba78a96a","tid":476719,"uid":46323,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-22T09:55:44.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/chicken.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
