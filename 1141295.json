United States, mere disagreement with speech is never enough to condemn it: political majorities should be content to put their faith in the marketplace of ideas, that their ideas will win out in the end, and if they don't, that they didn't deserve to in the first place.[1] Thus, the marketplace of ideas confronts &quot;bad speech&quot; by offering the remedy of &quot;good speech&quot; and competition to cure it.[2]<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo; The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution. It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment. Every year if not every day we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge. While that experiment is part of our system I think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country.[3] &rdquo;<br />\nOf course, the marketplace cannot be expected to cure all bad speech. Where speech constitutes an incitement to a breach of the peace, for example, the government should feel free to step in.[4]<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.conservapedia.com/Marketplace_of_ideas\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.conservapedia.com%2FMarketplace_of_ideas&d=9OMcXw0STyGFZrzowU4xHtfEBUFsnbtb5M0%2Bd5EIgxU%3D&h=8f6f9f5e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.conservapedia.com/Marketplace_of_ideas</a>"},{"pid":"9f5ed320a42fac823b4a0d3af06ea15cad610a77","tid":1141295,"uid":251026,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-05-06T18:21:27.000Z","msg":"Since 2009, the Obama administration has prosecuted more people as whistleblowers under the 1917 Espionage Act than all former presidents combined, a fact often rehashed in journalistic circles. In some of those cases, officials seized journalists&rsquo; phone and email records to use in their investigation. James Goodale, who was The New York Times&rsquo; chief counsel during Pentagon Papers coverage, has told CJR that Obama&rsquo;s aggressive crackdown on whistleblowers is &ldquo;antediluvian, conservative, backwards.
