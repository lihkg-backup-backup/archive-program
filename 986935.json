At that point, Microsoft ended feature development entirely, shipping only security updates and bug fixes. That's going to come to an end on Patch Tuesday this coming December.<br />\n<br />\nCertain online services will continue to operate beyond that date; device backups for settings and applications will work for three months, to March 10, 2020, and photo uploads and restoring devices from backups will work for 12 months beyond the end of support.<br />\n<br />\nMicrosoft's guidance for customers is to &quot;move to a supported Android or iOS device&quot; and use the range of Microsoft applications on one of those platforms instead. From the sole perspective of running Microsoft's applications, Android is the better choice; the operating system is more flexible, enabling deeper integration and richer functionality. iOS, however, remains the better choice for long-term operating system support and updates."}]}
