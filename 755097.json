He has since apologized for the posts and said they do not represent who he is now. <br />\n<br />\nDisney's decision to fire Gunn from the third installment of the Marvel franchise infuriated a number of people in the business, including the stars of the superhero films. <br />\n<br />\nMichael Rooker, who played Yondu, said he was leaving Twitter over &quot;the ongoing BULLS&mdash;T.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;This account will be inactive after today,&rdquo; Rooker wrote. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very tired &amp; upset over the ongoing BULLS&ndash;T&hellip; neither I nor my rep will use Twitter again. Twitter sucks and I want nothing to do with it. Thank you to all who gave kind words &amp; support. See you on Instagram.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nDave Bautista, who plays Drax, also sent a number of tweets in which he defended Gunn while expressing his anger over the termination. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;I will have more to say but for right now all I will say is this..@JamesGunn is one of the most loving,caring,good natured people I have ever met. He&rsquo;s gentle and kind and cares deeply for people and animals. He&rsquo;s made mistakes. We all have. Im NOT ok with what&rsquo;s happening to him,&quot; the actor wrote. <br />\n<br />\nChris Pratt, who plays Star-Lord, posted a tweet referring to the situation. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;'Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters. Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.' JAMES 1:19,&quot; Pratt tweeted.<br />\n<br />\nZoe Saldana, who plays Gamora, wrote, &quot;It&rsquo;s been a challenging weekend I&rsquo;m not gonna lie. I&rsquo;m pausing myself to take everything in before I speak out of term. I just want everyone to know I love ALL members of my GOTG family. Always will.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nPom Klementieff, who plays Mantis, shared a video of a note she wrote, which reads, &quot;We are Groot. We are a family. We stand together.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nFinally, Gunn's brother and Guardians actor, Sean Gunn, wrote a lengthy post about the situation on Instagram. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;It goes without saying that I love and support my brother James and I&rsquo;m quite proud of how kind, generous, and compassionate he is with all the people in his life,&quot; he wrote in part. <br />\n<br />\nThe Hollywood Reporter reached out to reps for Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel for comment."},{"pid":"2330367da49a298d588b5d980b9b5206029fa33a","tid":755097,"uid":106950,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T02:37:34.000Z","msg":"佢套戲係好睇嘅 但係俾人搵到咁多孌童tweet仲有得兜咩..."},{"pid":"b5472f4a7c1e9bbe64f0c54f5307bd7bbc626440","tid":755097,"uid":105567,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T02:43:25.000Z","msg":"DC又贏"},{"pid":"f775754f699dad9990c2b3a7ab05e7dab9c75ef5","tid":755097,"uid":134071,"like":1,"dislike":11,"score":-10,"quote":{"pid":"b5472f4a7c1e9bbe64f0c54f5307bd7bbc626440","tid":755097,"uid":105567,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T02:43:25.000Z","msg":"DC又贏"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T02:49:09.000Z","msg":"Zack Snyder既戲好過Marvel.  <br />\n<br />\n起碼Zack Snyder係右派 (仲將會改篇經典右派小說The Fountainhead) , Marvel就左膠泛濫...."},{"pid":"0375a4dbf5f8cd4baa96b4a65ef47785af5f1946","tid":755097,"uid":104035,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T02:58:21.000Z","msg":"而家最快速洗底方法係咪反trump同撐同性戀?"},{"pid":"868dc6f99f891bd4b83908e76943b301c9008926","tid":755097,"uid":134071,"like":4,"dislike":1,"score":3,"quote":{"pid":"0375a4dbf5f8cd4baa96b4a65ef47785af5f1946","tid":755097,"uid":104035,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T02:58:21.000Z","msg":"而家最快速洗底方法係咪反trump同撐同性戀?"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-25T03:01:30.000Z","msg":"係影壇洗底: 反trump同撐同性戀<br />\n<br />\n係政壇洗底: 撐trump同反同性戀"}]}
