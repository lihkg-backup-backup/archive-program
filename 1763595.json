I has always thought that many other countries were better than hong kong but after I went on holiday in these countries I realised that in terms of city life, nightlife, food and shopping, Hong kong really is the best. In europe shops close at five on weekdays and don't open at all at weekends except for big cities like London where shops close at six on weekdays and four at weekends. Their main sets of entertainment are pubs and clubs. Las vegas has spectacular night views but it was primarily built for tourism. It's famous for gambling, unique hotel design and shows like boxing events. However in terms of scenery Scandinavia and Tibet are the most ravishing I would say. Tibet is famous for its breathtaking scenery at high altitude. Xinjiang is also a place of outstanding scenic beauty. If you think you might have altitude sickness such as dizziness, headaches and trouble sleeping,  I suggest bringing some medicine along with you. In fact my friend who's just been to the Mount Everest base camp showed me her photos taken there by which I was awestruck. It's definitely a glamorous holiday destination. A tour of the base camp would indeed be a once in a lifetime experience. Tibet is also the best place for stargazing I would say since it's much closer to the heavens than any other places on earth. It has some of the highest lakes in the world which are rich with fish and other marine life and the countryside is inhabited by flocks of yellow ducks as well as wild horses and donkeys. The lakes in there such as Lake Paiku which is four thousand five hundred and ninety two metres above sea level reflect the beauty of the stars giving a double view of the sky at night. You can even set up a tent and camp there to get the best view of the stars and the milky way galaxy."}]}
