Had been live tweeting the discovery of the Chinese cop since it first happened. <br />\nAfter about an hour of him being quizzed, they tried to move him. It seemed that they would exit him via a human passageway. I was right at the front of the passageway ready to film it. It quickly became apparent that it wasn&rsquo;t a passage way out but a gauntlet for a mass beating. The guy was already beaten up. Now the crowd began to punch and kick him. <br />\nOther media looked on and filmed. But I&rsquo;m just not this kind of person, and I had to protect him, with my own body for nearly 40 mins. <br />\nPretty intense. <br />\nNow...<br />\nI support escalation. I vividly understand how angry Hong Kongers are. I know I shouldn&rsquo;t get actively involved. I also know that he was a Chinese cop, dressed as a protester, caught with sticks, and so had evil intentions towards HK. <br />\nBut on a human level I could not stand by, or even walk away from a man being beaten to a pulp. <br />\nSo yeah it was a rough ride. <br />\nThe angry protesters respected what I was doing, and never intentionally hit me, not once. But, I got a few accidental knocks. <br />\n-<br />\nI&rsquo;m sorry this happened. <br />\nI dunno what the outcome should&rsquo;ve been. I don&rsquo;t even know if my protecting him with my own body was the right thing to do. <br />\n-<br />\nThis isn&rsquo;t a war. It&rsquo;s a revolution, we&rsquo;re fighting a system, not individuals. <br />\nI think many protesters acted really badly tonight.<br />\nBut, I also blame the HK police too. Their actions on Sunday, when they dressed up as protesters and then started beating and arresting people changed everything. Everyone is on a hair trigger now and riddled with paranoia and anger. <br />\nI said on Sunday, after this despicable tactic, any cop or agent provocateur caught by the protesters would be in life threatening danger. Well, I was proven right tonight, and also got a proxy beating for it. 🤣<br />\nAnyway, I&rsquo;m all fine. A few scratches and bruises over my body and face. <br />\nHK is very much broken. Only the government can stop this. <br />\nIn the meantime, get out and protest whenever you can. Every little will help in the long run.<br />\nFootnote:I don&rsquo;t believe the people trying to hurt the cop were other cops or agent provocateurs. I believe they were really angry protesters. Why do I think this? Bcus I would&rsquo;ve been beaten more if that was the case. The protesters never deliberately hit me, no matter how much I tried to stop them.//<br />\n<br />\n最後想引用劉曉波先生:<br />\n「因為，仇恨會腐蝕一個人的智慧和良知，敵人意識將毒化一個民族的精神，煽動起你死我活的殘酷鬥爭，毀掉一個社會的寬容和人性，阻礙一個國家走向自由民主的進程。<br />\n所以，我希望自己能夠超越個人的遭遇來看待國家的發展和社會的變化，以最大的善意對待政權的敵意，以愛化解恨。」"},{"pid":"c4b152d80c2786342ae4f2ffa53a4906a97c5cfd","tid":1467697,"uid":4138,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:34:03.000Z","msg":"要跨岀呢一步唔係咁易<br />\nRespect"},{"pid":"27560d5a491de7a540a5b6a0dbe1a875488531da","tid":1467697,"uid":45556,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-26T03:09:43.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">Richard Scotford 再次發出消息<br />\n原文<br />\nWARNING: I have this from extremely reliable source that from 27th September until October 1st, Hong Kong will become a quasi police state, with the police being hyper aggressive to any gatherings of people, for whatever reason .
