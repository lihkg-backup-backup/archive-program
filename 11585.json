to national heroes -- has been cut tragically short, leaving the country mourning the loss of one its most endearing sports teams.<br />\n<br />\nOn Tuesday, the airplane carrying the Brazilian team to the biggest game in the club's history crashed in Rionegro, Colombia, killing 75 people. Six people survived the crash and were taken to local hospitals, according to authorities.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The dream is over,&quot; Plinio David de Nes Filho, chairman of the club's board told TV Globo. &quot;Yesterday morning I was saying goodbye to them, they told me they were going in search of the dream, to make this dream a reality.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;And we, very excitedly, shared this dream with them. But the dream was over this morning.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nChapecoense was supposed to play the first leg of its Copa Sudamericana final on Wednesday against Colombian side Atletico Nacional from Medellin before its plane came down.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Chapecoense was one of the most lovely fairy tales,&quot; Argentine sports journalist Martin Mazur told CNN. &quot;Unlike what happens with the big Brazilian clubs, Chapecoense's humble story and its magnificent run in the Copa Sudamericana was naturally embraced by Brazilian football fans in general, becoming a fans' favorite.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It was South America's Cinderella -- nobody could have predicted this macabre ending.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe Copa Sudamericana, the second biggest intercontinental club competition in South America and the equivalent to Europe's Europa League, had provided the backdrop to Chapecoense's remarkable story.<br />\n<br />\nThe club, from Chapeco in the state of Santa Catarina in the south of Brazil was only formed in the 1970s and was playing in the country's fourth tier as recently as 2007.<br />\n<br />\nA team with few big names, apart from Cleber Santana, who once played for Atletico Madrid and Mallorca in Spain, it went toe-to-toe with the big boys of Brazilian football.<br />\n<br />\nFull of grit, team spirit and determination, not to mention quality, Chapecoense was a relatively unfashionable team hoping to tread a path laid out by English champions Leicester City.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/29/football/brazil-chapecoense-plane-crash/index.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fedition.cnn.com%2F2016%2F11%2F29%2Ffootball%2Fbrazil-chapecoense-plane-crash%2Findex.html&d=2bx9SR3QHfMC8bM4fPAEX38C1RzHckko4WZAlj2iIrY%3D&h=af7e2954\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=http%3A%2F%2Fedition.cnn.com%2F2016%2F11%2F29%2Ffootball%2Fbrazil-chapecoense-plane-crash%2Findex.html&h=4af1adae\" target=\"_blank\">http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/29/football/brazil-chapecoense-plane-crash/index.html</a>"},{"pid":"e2ffc45d1a6d307bb6b203495b37d8b05435cba2","tid":11585,"uid":22675,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-11-29T15:30:14.000Z","msg":"貼得link點解唔順便貼埋文字啊<br />\n<br />\n一架由玻利維亞起飛、載有72名乘客及9名機組人員的拉米亞航空（LAMIA airlines）包機，在哥倫比亞第二大城市麥德林（Medellin）附近墜毀，機上僅5人生還。獲救的空姐稱，客機墜毀懷疑與燃油不足有關；不過麥德林機場當局就指，飛機出事是與電子系統出問題有關。<br />\n報道指，機上載有巴西的職業足球員，他們是效力巴甲球隊查比高恩斯，原定周三參加南美球會盃的決賽首回合，對手是哥倫比亞勁旅國民體育會。<br />\n肇事客機是由玻利維亞起飛，正前往麥德林國際機場，客機據稱是在當地時間下午10時許墜毀。<br />\n路透社／美聯社／德新社／今日俄羅斯"},{"pid":"182b9a38ec8c91eca72e7a0bef8e8cb190574996","tid":11585,"uid":37475,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-11-29T23:39:23.000Z","msg":"RIP<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
