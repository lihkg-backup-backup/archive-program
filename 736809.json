And I sometimes wonder  that has everything actually been destined . <br />\n<br />\nCan we create our own fate , or has our fate been created since we&rsquo;re here , since a very long time ago , since the moment we were born , the moment we were still sitting quietly and peacefully in our mother&rsquo;s ...<br />\n<br />\nThe world is interesting , almost everything is . You missed a plane caused by an accident , probably your dog ate up your carpet , but not for a long time the news reported an accident of plane-crash that you could have been on , is this just luck , or is it because in your fate there never existed in your scene , your pre-determined scene . <br />\n<br />\nOn the other hand , someone could have taken the later flight but instead they picked the earlier one for some reasons and they suffered  . <br />\n<br />\nWhat explains this? Just being unlucky , or is it the word fate again ? <br />\n<br />\nSo , the question today is , can we change our fate , our destiny , or are we  simply destined . If the latter is true , what&rsquo;s the point of doing anything now ? <br />\n<br />\nIs this world similar to sim city ? Instead of this time we are not the one who&rsquo;s controlling . Instead we are controlled by someone , something , could be God ,or he has sett us some limitation and let us control ourself but only within the range. <br />\n<br />\nSorry for the poor English , cause typing Chinese would causes a lot more trouble ."},{"pid":"ce5dbf113dcb61d56796c9fdca85056173ca3e74","tid":736809,"uid":15850,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-10T13:34:13.000Z","msg":"Diu no Chinese"},{"pid":"c1df2b5bfbeb6ddba0b398cf2d4215c5aec7c87c","tid":736809,"uid":17479,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"ce5dbf113dcb61d56796c9fdca85056173ca3e74","tid":736809,"uid":15850,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-10T13:34:13.000Z","msg":"Diu no Chinese"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-10T13:49:37.000Z","msg":"好撚煩 唔想打字"}]}
