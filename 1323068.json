Chanting &ldquo;Democracy for Hong Kong,&rdquo; &ldquo;Carrie Lam resign,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love your country, come protest,&rdquo; they moved through the streets in unison, using hand signals to motion to the back of the crowd when it was time to stop for a red light and when it was OK to cross an intersection.
