His father, who has subsequently been released, was being held for ransom and being threatened with death, the midfielder told David Hytner of the Guardian on Tuesday:<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I played while my father was in the hands of bandits. I had to suppress the trauma. I took a call four hours before kick-off to tell me what had happened. I was emotionally distraught and I had to make the decision about whether I was mentally ready to play. I was confused. I did not know what to do but, in the end, I knew that I could not let 180 million Nigerians down. I had to shut it out of my head and go and represent my country first. I could not even inform the coaches or NFF staff and only a very tight circle of my friends knew.<br />\n<br />\nI was told that they would shoot my dad instantly if I reported to the authorities or told anybody. I also did not want to discuss it with the coach [Gernot Rohr] because I did not want my issue to become a distraction to him or the rest of the team on the day of such an important game. As much as I wanted to discuss it with the coach, I could not.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Thankfully, my father was safely released on Monday afternoon. I thank the police authorities for their rescue efforts and the support I&rsquo;ve received from friends and family members. Unfortunately, my dad is now in hospital receiving emergency treatment as a result of the torture he received during his capture.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n為左出線可以去到幾盡<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dislike.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
