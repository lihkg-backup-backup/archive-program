They are both romanisation of the word &quot;推&quot; in Chinese, meaning &quot;Push&quot;, with the latter being the Cantonese one. We said &quot;push&quot; when we wanna push the post up the feed to gather attention.  Could be annoying sometimes but when most of us &quot;push&quot; the post, chances are that the post is urgent and requires serious attention or investigation. <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/itdog1.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n10-combo, 十連, refers to the behaviour of replying consecutively for 10 times without being disturbed by any other comments.
