They will then discuss the case as a group before issuing a final decision on whether the content should be allowed to stay up or not.<br />\n<br />\n⋯⋯The members are a globally diverse group with lawyers, journalists, human rights advocates and other academics. Between them, they are said to have expertise in areas like digital rights, religious freedom, conflicts between rights, content moderation, internet censorship and civil rights.<br />\n<br />\nNotable members include Alan Rusbridger, former editor in chief of The Guardian newspaper, and Andr&aacute;s Saj&oacute;, a former judge and VP of the European Court of Human Rights.<br />\n<br />\nHelle Thorning-Schmidt, the former Prime Minister of Denmark, is one of the board's four co-chairs. &quot;Up until now some of the most difficult decisions about content have been made by Facebook and you could say Mark Zuckerberg,&quot; she said on a call with the press Wednesday. &quot;Facebook has decided to change that.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/facebook-names-first-members-of-oversight-board-for-content-moderation.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2020%2F05%2F06%2Ffacebook-names-first-members-of-oversight-board-for-content-moderation.html&d=HVlUx73Us%2FxglV2o%2BMpWBYMLxsd%2B2XAbZoZSjzCx9%2B0%3D&h=bbb2e4f6\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/facebook-names-first-members-of-oversight-board-for-content-moderation.html</a>"},{"pid":"99bc1cb306859b6dcf1f5ab7f85a4c5ddb9322da","tid":2004907,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-06T18:07:56.000Z","msg":"完整名單<br />\n<br />\nAfia Asantewaa Asare-Kyei, human rights advocate at the Open Society Initiative for West Africa<br />\nEvelyn Aswad, University of Oklahoma College of Law professor who formerly served as a senior U.S. State Department lawyer<br />\nEndy Bayuni, journalist who twice served as the editor-in-chief of the Jakarta Post<br />\nCatalina Botero-Marino, Facebook Oversight Board co-chair, Dean of the Universidad de los Andes Faculty of Law<br />\nKatherine Chen, communications scholar at the National Chengchi University and former national communications regulator in Taiwan<br />\nNighat Dad, digital rights advocate who received the Human Rights Tulip Award<br />\nJamal Greene, Facebook Oversight Board co-chair, Columbia Law professor<br />\nPamela Karlan, Stanford Law professor and United States Supreme Court advocate<br />\nTawakkol Karman, Nobel Peace Prize laureate named as one of &quot;History's Most Rebellious Women&quot;
