While the withdrawal of the Extradition Bill is very much still on the agenda, much of the public ire has shifted to the Hong Kong Police Force. The HKPF has joined Carrie Lam, the embattled Chief Executive, as public enemy #1 by using violent and at times inhumane, tactics in dispersing the protests, by selectively making and not making arrests, and by failing at its job altogether.<br />\n<br />\nIn an attempt to restore some measure of order, Lam has so far been happy to hide behind the door, and to use the police force as well as the force of the police as their sole weapon of choice. That approached has only fueled public anger with every each additional arrest and casualty &ndash; one young woman has had her eye taken by a police bullet on Sunday. Ugly scenes between the protesting crowds and the &ldquo;police dogs&rdquo; are on repeat several times a week.<br />\n<br />\nMany now realize peaceful demonstrations are ineffective while radical behaviors only pile up the injuried and arrested. The latest resort is to hit where it hurts the most &ndash; the economy. A strike was held on August 5 to mixed effect. While it was wide in terms of scale, participation was largely confined to smaller businesses whose temporary shutdown was of an inconvenience to some; larger corporations tend to have great ties with the Mainland; some didn&rsquo;t buy into that particular method of protesting (working class in Hong Kong are known for its loyalty to their jobs that borders the ridiculous); some were simply against the protest itself (there is still a sizable camp in Hong Kong who firmly believe these protests are US-funded movements attepting to destablize China). Then there is the unsustainability &ndash; most working men and women are not prepared to risk losing their jobs to participate in prolonged strikes.<br />\n<br />\nAnd that took us to The Airport."},{"pid":"708870610c963e28598f07120274ffead1f3a6a2","tid":1470079,"uid":47226,"like":13,"dislike":0,"score":13,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-14T04:08:45.000Z","msg":"Sit-ins at the Hong Kong International Airport on Monday and Tuesday were largely viewed as the trump card to put the government&rsquo;s mettle to the most serious test yet. Monday&rsquo;s gathering forced hundreds of flight cancellations, stranded travellers by tens of thousands, and is said to have cost $13billion in lost air cargo revenue. Day 2 was more mild in respect of the disruptions caused, but it did not fail to make international headlines. Violence erupted in the evening once the police decided to intervene. Police actions, however, were relatively mild compared to Sunday, seeminly wary to the presence of visitors and shops inside the airport.  <br />\n<br />\nTalks of deploying the Chinese People&rsquo;s Liberation Army have circulated in the last few weeks. Those speculations were fueled by President Trump&rsquo;s tweet Tuesday afternoon. Most still view that scenario unlikely as that comes at a high cost. Deployment of the garrison puts the final nail on the &ldquo;One-Country-Two Systems&rdquo; coffin. A series of chain reactions would follow - foreign assets and investments would leave the region if Hong Kong is to lose its &ldquo;Special Administrative Region&rdquo; status; international sanctions could await China, not least from the US whom they are in a trade war with. It also gives ammunitions to president Tsai-Eng-Wen&rsquo;s re-election efforts in Taiwan, potentially adding to a long list of problems that President Xi is facing. There are huge economic and intangible costs that China are not prepared to pay. <br />\n<br />\nAs for the protesting crowd, some vowed to fight on. Others, while still fighting, actually welcome prospect of troops coming south of the border. &ldquo;If we burn, you burn with us&rdquo;, one of the most widely seen banners around protests. As Carrie Lam recently labelled the protesting youth as &ldquo;individuals with no stakes in the society&rdquo;, they challenge China to push the nuclear button on Hong Kong and let the dust settle.<br />\n<br />\nBut for now, the fight goes on. Another demonstration is set to take place this weekend, and for many involved on either side, another Saturday comes a new battle. There is no end insight"},{"pid":"5e3c7cb722004db31eb4e09ee9db04eb64f16de5","tid":1470079,"uid":82938,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-14T15:10:08.000Z","msg":"<img
