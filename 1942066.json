When I returned from my trip around Central Europe I isolated myself (in a borrowed apartment away from my mother and sister) since the number of cases of COVID-19 (in Germany for instance) were similar to Italy in the beginning. Around ten days ago I started feeling some symptoms, exactly the same time as my father - who traveled with me from Brussels. I was feeling tired, had shivers, a sore throat and coughed. My dad experienced the same symptoms, but much more intense and with a fever.<br />\nIn Sweden you can not test yourself for COVID-19 unless you&rsquo;re in need of emergent medical treatment. Everyone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate themselves.<br />\nI have therefore not been tested for COVID-19, but it&rsquo;s extremely likely that I&rsquo;ve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances.<br />\n<br />\nNow I&rsquo;ve basically recovered, but - AND THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE: I almost didn&rsquo;t feel ill. My last cold was much worse than this! Had it not been for someone else having the virus simultainously I might not even have suspected anything. Then I would just have thought I was feeling unusually tired with a bit of a cough.<br />\nAnd this it what makes it so much more dangerous. Many (especially young people) might not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they don&rsquo;t know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups.<br />\nWe who don&rsquo;t belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others.<br />\n<br />\nPlease keep that in mind, follow the advice from experts and your local authorities and #StayAtHome to slow the spread of the virus. And remember to always take care of each other and help those in need.<br />\n#COVID #flattenthecurve"},{"pid":"34c58d13f08e75b81af573827c1dc4c5b13015c3","tid":1942066,"uid":25858,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T23:17:05.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e23d221aa1795d0690e3edc4f627e2dd0529b24b","tid":1942066,"uid":169116,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T23:18:53.000Z","msg":"咁抵死"},{"pid":"c790adf0289acc6459a0a3dc29ca627802c4fc50","tid":1942066,"uid":135503,"like":3,"dislike":1,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T23:22:45.000Z","msg":"對住歐美how dare you<br />\n對住支那就死晒狗<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"01e6a73cd9872ee0c11c4904522abe67b25fa120","tid":1942066,"uid":312363,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T23:23:38.000Z","msg":"垃圾"},{"pid":"eda8bae7f82513b147126781c2dff851c130732b","tid":1942066,"uid":121146,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T23:23:59.000Z","msg":"一定要有事"},{"pid":"57409ec4fb931ec3838c88442c49d7cc1272e5cb","tid":1942066,"uid":41423,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T23:30:29.000Z","msg":"how dare virus<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a1739fa9c403487812c39fbb1fdc4899b9d666f1","tid":1942066,"uid":171849,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T23:34:01.000Z","msg":"佢都算係咁啦<br />\n叫人stay at home"},{"pid":"e60ff80edc5f7867b197e7b2ca4fc76d53b38cff","tid":1942066,"uid":221265,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a1739fa9c403487812c39fbb1fdc4899b9d666f1","tid":1942066,"uid":171849,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T23:34:01.000Z","msg":"佢都算係咁啦<br />\n叫人stay at home"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T23:34:28.000Z","msg":"都係嘅"}]}
