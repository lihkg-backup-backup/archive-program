By studying in Hong Kong, I&rsquo;ll be able to connect with another people and culture at a new level,&rdquo; he said. <br />\n<br />\nGottfried&rsquo;s intrigue in international affairs has a family connection. From a young age, he experienced diverse cultures at home, which were enhanced by his educational experiences as he grew older.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;My mother, an immigrant from China, exposed me daily to Chinese culture, while my father&rsquo;s vocation as a pastor for international students brought multicultural visitors frequently to our home. These experiences generated a curiosity in me about anything international,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In high school, I became obsessed with competitive debate. One year the debate topic was the Middle East, which sparked a personal fascination with the meeting ground of the international and the political &ndash; international politics.&rdquo;"}]}
