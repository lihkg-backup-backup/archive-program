Or so musicians like to claim. &ldquo;With music,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;you can communicate across cultural and linguistic boundaries in ways that you can&rsquo;t with ordinary languages like English or French.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nEvery human culture has music, just as each has language. So it&rsquo;s true that music is a universal feature of the human experience. At the same time, both music and linguistic systems vary widely from culture to culture. In fact, unfamiliar musical systems may not even sound like music. I&rsquo;ve overheard Western-trained music scholars dismiss Javanese gamelan as &ldquo;clanging pots&rdquo; and traditional Chinese opera as &ldquo;cackling hens.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nIs music a kind of language? We have to define our terms. In everyday life, we often use &ldquo;language&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;communication system.&rdquo; Biologists talk about the &ldquo;language of bees,&rdquo; which is a way to tell hive mates about the location of a new source of nectar.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBy definition, language is a communication system consisting of (1) a set of meaningful symbols (words) and (2) a set of rules for combining those symbols (syntax) into larger meaningful units (sentences). While many species have communication systems, none of these count as a language because they lack one or the other component.<br />\n<br />\nLike language, music has syntax&mdash;rules for ordering elements&mdash;such as notes, chords, and intervals&mdash;into complex structures. Yet none of these elements has meaning on its own. Rather, it&rsquo;s the larger structure&mdash;the melody&mdash;that conveys emotional meaning. And it does that by mimicking the prosody of speech.<br />\n<br />\nSince music and language share features in common, it&rsquo;s not surprising that many of the brain areas that process language also process music. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that music is language. Part of the misunderstanding comes from the way we tend to think about specific areas of the brain as having specific functions. Any complex behavior, whether language or music or driving a car, will recruit contributions from many different brain areas.<br />\n<br />\nMusic certainly isn&rsquo;t a universal language in the sense that you could use it to express any thought to any person on the planet. But music does have the power to evoke deep primal feelings at the core of the shared human experience. It not only crosses cultures, it also reaches deep into our evolutionary past. And it that sense, music truly is a universal language.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>David Ludden is the author of </em></strong><strong><em><ins>The Psychology of Language: An Integrated Approach.</ins></em></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>References</strong><br />\nPatel, A.
