His arrest in January took place despite repeated assurances by the Chinese authorities that Mr Gui was free at that time. China's actions are in breach of international rules on consular support and raise serious questions about China's application of the rule of law, including the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The EU fully supports the efforts of the Swedish government in this case. We expect the Chinese authorities to allow Mr Gui to meet Swedish diplomatic and medical staff, and to release him so that he can be reunited with his daughter and family.​<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/39919/statement-high-representativevice-president-federica-mogherini-continued-detention-gui-minhai_en\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Feeas.europa.eu%2Fheadquarters%2Fheadquarters-homepage%2F39919%2Fstatement-high-representativevice-president-federica-mogherini-continued-detention-gui-minhai_en&d=y8Uj6sQNro%2FuKFV%2B%2B0MCuJzN29kXmk9bB7xBuKM86BA%3D&h=2778e7c0\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/39919/statement-high-representativevice-president-federica-mogherini-continued-detention-gui-minhai_en</a>"}]}
