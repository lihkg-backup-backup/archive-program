I am writing to express my anger and disappointment regarding how the university handle the memorial service for Mr Chow Tsz-lok.<br />\n<br />\nIt is ridiculous that a top university doesn&rsquo;t even allow its Student Union to organize a memorial service for its past student. It&rsquo;s terrifying to see how the University and its management treat its own student. This also shows how cold blooded you are, as the head of the University. You couldn&rsquo;t protect your students when they are alive and you don&rsquo;t allow your student to be mourned when they are dead. I feel ashamed to be the alumnus of such an university. And the only thing I feel fortunate about is that my diploma wasn&rsquo;t signed by you.<br />\n<br />\nFrom a Furious Alumnus of HKUST"},{"pid":"c4fea6b936260d5cfba261375d68780b11e0e72a","tid":2007655,"uid":203497,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-05-08T12:33:50.000Z","msg":"屎維唔識中文架？"},{"pid":"dcd0bf68288aa1029fe5b6c23b7ab8d0163fafc6","tid":2007655,"uid":70085,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"c4fea6b936260d5cfba261375d68780b11e0e72a","tid":2007655,"uid":203497,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-05-08T12:33:50.000Z","msg":"屎維唔識中文架？"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-08T12:35:11.000Z","msg":"唔知佢，不過我中文仲渣"}]}
