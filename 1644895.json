Male Police Entering Delivery Suite�<br />\nNormally, a pregnant woman is sent to the Delivery Suite first for routine gynaecological examination, and then transferred to the Antenatal Ward. As the police said at the press conference, they did not enter the Antenatal Ward. However, what they did not reveal is that they actually entered the Delivery Suite, instead of the Antenatal Ward. The pregnant woman arrested was suspected of leaking amniotic fluid, awaiting examination in the delivery Suite. She had to take off all of her clothings and put on the surgical gown. She was then sent to the Delivery Suite and laid on bed, opened the legs and let the physician collect the fluid from vagina for examination. At that moment, the male police claimed that he has to take a statement from the patient so that he entered the delivery room.<br />\n2. Ward In-Charge Infringing Patients&rsquo; Privacy�<br />\nThere were one male and one female police at the site. When the police on duty claimed that they have to take a statement from the patient, the IN-CHARGE personally allowed the male police to enter the delivery room, while leaving the female police outside. And more importantly, there were other pregnant women inside the delivery room apart from the suspect.<br />\n3. Police Lied in the Press Conference�<br />\nThe arrested pregnant woman was sent to hospital in the midnight. In the press conference, the police claimed that there were other male relatives in the ward, which was not the truth. The fact is that no relative is allowed to enter the ward area except during visiting hours: from 12 noon to 1pm and from 5:30pm to 8:30pm.<br />\nThe police force is clearly violating the human rights and insulting the female, especially the pregnant women.
