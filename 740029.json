The U.S., the European Union, Japan and others will disagree and are expected to criticize China&rsquo;s failure to embrace market-based principles and reform its intellectual property and subsidy regimes, said the people, who asked not to be named because the meeting hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.<br />\n<br />\nThe gathering, which starts on Wednesday and finishes on July 13, comes amid a worldwide escalation in trade tensions, with Trump hitting China with tariffs on $34 billion of its products and regions including the European Union, India and Switzerland starting complaints at the WTO against the two superpowers. In Geneva, the organization&rsquo;s members will review China&rsquo;s trade policies and assess its performance in upholding multilateral rules.<br />\n<br />\nThe Trump administration previously said it &ldquo;erred&rdquo; in supporting China&rsquo;s membership of the WTO because it has &ldquo;proven to be ineffective in securing China&rsquo;s embrace of an open, market-oriented trade regime,&rdquo; according to a U.S. Trade Representative report released in January. The U.S. delegation will be represented by Acting Assistant USTR for China Affairs Terry McCartin and U.S. Permanent Representative to the WTO Dennis Shea.<br />\n<br />\nWTO Commitments<br />\nChina will reiterate details from a recent government paper, defending the country&rsquo;s efforts to integrate itself into the global trading system, the people said.<br />\n<br />\nChina &ldquo;comprehensively fulfilled its commitments to the WTO, substantially opened its market to the world, and delivered mutually beneficial and win-win outcomes on a wider scale,&rdquo; according to the June 28 report. China &ldquo;firmly observes and upholds the WTO rules, and supports the multilateral trading system that is open, transparent, inclusive and non-discriminatory,&rdquo; according to the white paper.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe U.S. and others will press China to address its role in creating the overcapacity in steel and aluminum markets that has depressed global prices and shuttered mills across the globe. Trump has embraced a hard-line approach to China&rsquo;s overcapacity problems and launched 25 percent tariffs on steel products that the administration said is necessary to defend America&rsquo;s national-security interests.<br />\n<br />\nTrump&rsquo;s moves have also pushed the EU to impose provisional safeguard restrictions on steel imports in order to help curb cheap foreign steel from entering the European market.<br />\n<br />\nIP Theft<br />\nWTO members are also expected to criticize Chinese technology transfer policies that they say are discriminatory and result in the theft of intellectual property and technology secrets. The Trump administration escalated its fight on June 6 when it imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods and threatened duties on as much as $500 billion worth of products.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, both the U.S. and the EU have filed WTO dispute complaints that allege various Chinese laws and regulations violate the WTO&rsquo;s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights."},{"pid":"46019d8bf80becdd66e7602ee282b84c108fd789","tid":740029,"uid":63669,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T14:04:55.000Z","msg":"中國或成宇宙第一嬴家"},{"pid":"445270e0d1b306e11e8fed9f3ac93baa8ddc0ae4","tid":740029,"uid":141151,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T14:05:26.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> China may be the biggest winner"},{"pid":"65167832f87d0bc3c462baa188b446775acd7b63","tid":740029,"uid":6604,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T14:07:52.000Z","msg":"支那係國際毒撚<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"01aca50fc23eefa857563ae8930c004830785996","tid":740029,"uid":55913,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T14:16:52.000Z","msg":"五毛呢"},{"pid":"4b0e42215c32ec22b44e1b645774fdc5ec12a61c","tid":740029,"uid":42751,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T14:21:18.000Z","msg":"英國要撐中國，怪唔得脫歐"},{"pid":"905c25e3facac316f3214c703fdd3a79169e8e61","tid":740029,"uid":41245,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"4b0e42215c32ec22b44e1b645774fdc5ec12a61c","tid":740029,"uid":42751,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T14:21:18.000Z","msg":"英國要撐中國，怪唔得脫歐"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T15:31:29.000Z","msg":"鳩噏唔洗本"},{"pid":"aca4aa97ffc1021e27c48d86bd22d361d7ca1c17","tid":740029,"uid":511,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T15:54:40.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6db34d2fc6056f233acf62a24585df05dda6faeb","tid":740029,"uid":104699,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T16:02:11.000Z","msg":"求仁得仁，可以挑戰歐美<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"55c5cfa4f85e09990be5f67bb15cca67f511e15c","tid":740029,"uid":44105,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T16:41:49.000Z","msg":"China<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b771cbce46af2657b6a6923b2e1d16fd3f78c4a5","tid":740029,"uid":36454,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T17:04:35.000Z","msg":"有冇ching 可以講解下出局既後果<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n係冇得交易定要收重税"},{"pid":"bde61f3656ec7166d9d6dc18cf9b8b22b5df4004","tid":740029,"uid":7632,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-13T03:03:36.000Z","msg":"刁大話：<br />\n<br />\n我有十四億市場<br />\n又有中国制造2025<br />\n又有全球最大內聯網<br />\n又係自古以來以農立國<br />\n又有假一賠十船堅炮利遼寧號<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n舍你班洋鬼子<br />\n<br />\n侵侵，你管好班黨員先講啦"},{"pid":"e69a0dea392ef2228a4b95478ab9b4effcf2a462","tid":740029,"uid":90735,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"445270e0d1b306e11e8fed9f3ac93baa8ddc0ae4","tid":740029,"uid":141151,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T14:05:26.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> China may be the biggest winner"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-13T03:26:09.000Z","msg":"If this is true<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f19ea75bb5b8816ad9ff4149c8e3000637b79b66","tid":740029,"uid":41245,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"b771cbce46af2657b6a6923b2e1d16fd3f78c4a5","tid":740029,"uid":36454,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T17:04:35.000Z","msg":"有冇ching 可以講解下出局既後果<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n係冇得交易定要收重税"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-13T03:27:17.000Z","msg":"其實冇咩特別<br />\nWTO都四不像咯<br />\n根本冇咩國家想咩free trade<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/banghead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0d1e067e12f7f1355ba82dfc2e38f4f696446ba5","tid":740029,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-13T12:41:33.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/no.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
