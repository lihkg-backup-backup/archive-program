Our friendship started almost two centuries ago, but time is not what binds us. Instead, we are united through the actual ongoing struggles for Liberty and Justice for all.<br />\n<br />\nLife, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness&mdash;these natural and unalienable rights are not granted by the Basic Law, nor by the Chinese government. Unfortunately, these ideas are now under siege. The Hong Kong government has not only failed to secure these rights but has also become destructive of these ends. It no longer derives its power from the consent of the people. This, in turn, has led to violence. The institutions have failed the people over and over again, and bloodshed will persist if peaceful revolutions are continuously made impossible. If the current establishment remains unaltered, lives will be lost again in the future when the government introduces another bill with wicked intentions. <br />\n<br />\nDespite the appalling images that you see on the news, Hong Kong people are assertive yet kind, valiant yet graceful, resolute yet like water. In the Hong Kong that I love, people can take punches but not injustice. In the Hong Kong that I love, people still seek to resolve differences and put others before themselves. In the Hong Kong that I love, the Spirit of Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women.<br />\n<br />\nBut we cannot win this fight alone.<br />\n<br />\nSo, if you do hold these truths to be self-evident, please stand up for your brothers and sisters in Hong Kong and support the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The fate of democracy is at stake.<br />\n<br />\nBe the America that Hong Kong thinks you are. <br />\n<br />\nYours Sincerely,<br />\nA Hong Kongese"},{"pid":"de77baf0383bfdbbe6cd7ea058ab6eb490b67fe7","tid":1548216,"uid":278698,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T03:15:25.000Z","msg":"send to who?"},{"pid":"0bcc87e223439bf891d94c83d4da8ee5ac603f02","tid":1548216,"uid":146390,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T03:24:05.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"a6eb53523e13951f8f36d63987fb364c44e09895","tid":1548216,"uid":318799,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"de77baf0383bfdbbe6cd7ea058ab6eb490b67fe7","tid":1548216,"uid":278698,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T03:15:25.000Z","msg":"send to who?"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T10:32:27.000Z","msg":"House Representatives (Foreign Affairs Committee)+Senators"}]}
