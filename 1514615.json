Legislator XXX,<br />\n<br />\nWe are a group of Hongkongers who are passionate about and enjoy the human rights of our homeland. For more than two months, Hong Kong has faced an unprecedented political pressure from the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) government. The conflict evolved from a one-million-people peaceful protest to protracted conflicts between protesters and police across multiple districts. Although the focus has drifted from the extradition law to brutal police and government enforcement, the root of the civil disobedience resides on the lack of universal suffrage for both the Chief Executive Officer and Legislative Council.<br />\n<br />\nLegislator, a democratic representative in the establishment, is obliged to voice out for the people. As Senators in the Congressional-Executive Commission on China unite with Hong Kong and propose the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, the connection between Hong Kong Legislators and U.S. Senators frequent.<br />\n<br />\nAmid this critical moment, rumours [1-5] begin to stir as your stand in the Act still remains unclear. The Civic Party has just announced its support in the Act [6]. However, we have not known any clear public declaration on your support or denial on the Act and specifically its/other proposed actions. Special emphasis is on ensuring/proposing the following enforcement or amendment to its original statement:<br />\n1. Identify persons responsible for suppressing basic freedoms in Hong Kong. Freeze their U.S.-based assets and deny their entry into the U.S.<br />\n2. Ensure that Hong Kong VISA applicants, starting from 2019 June, shall not be denied on the basis of the applicant's arrest, detention or other government enforcement, motivated or biased by governmental political suppression as a result of participation in protest activities related to the current crisis.<br />\n3. Certify Hong Kong's autonomy before enacting any law or agreements differentiating Hong Kong from PRC. Reconsider to terminate the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act in 1992 if universal suffrage is still not installed by the beginning of 2020.<br />\n<br />\nWe also want to have your clarification on:<br />\n1. The list of Hong Kong/PRC government officials to be sanctioned.<br />\n2. Your sympathy and commitment on Hong Kong protestors participating in beyond-peaceful activities, such as storming the Legislative Council. To ensure that they shall not be denied from entry to the U.S. for their fight for democracy and exercising human rights.<br />\n3. A timetable for necessarily canceling the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy to enforce and facilitate universal suffrage.<br />\n4. Your participation to persuading and urging U.S. Senators in passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, aparting from reporting the recent scenario in Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nWe appreciate an unequivocal and succinct answer.<br />\n<br />\nWith faith in our homerland,<br />\nA group of Hong Kongers<br />\n<br />\n[1] <a
