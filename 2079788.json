And this has sparked the interest of at least 250,000 Twitter users to create new Parler accounts this week.  <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://thepostmillennial.com/conservatives-are-exploring-the-free-speech-platform-parler-as-an-alternative-to-twitter\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthepostmillennial.com%2Fconservatives-are-exploring-the-free-speech-platform-parler-as-an-alternative-to-twitter&d=b6PV2mHT5tDC6%2Fq4CXK2SiJMs%2BH1ZGqELk%2BE%2F7wpkaY%3D&h=768c5193\" target=\"_blank\">https://thepostmillennial.com/conservatives-are-exploring-the-free-speech-platform-parler-as-an-alternative-to-twitter</a>"},{"pid":"d78f91c29780ffac3dac1c26f15d80f0124b6390","tid":2079788,"uid":289191,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-27T01:22:14.000Z","msg":"要開"}]}
