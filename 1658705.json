V小隊流血革命攻略！Chapman Chen, HKBNews, reports<br />\nSummary: An self-proclaimed armed revolution group, Team V, announces its plan to escalate its militant action to a gory level before the November District Council Election &amp; publicizes its military strategy in a long online Chinese article. &quot;Our biggest problem is not the enemy learning our strategy but no one on the frontline knowing what they are doing.&quot; It argues that organization is needed to turn human &amp; material resources into combat power, that less is more. &quot;Don't get infatuated with number of people. The proper way to grow strong is to pragmatically organize comrades into small teams of 3 to 5 members. Battalions will be formed bottom-up from teams, and gradually divisions will be formed.&quot; <br />\n<br />\nIn terms of tactics, Team V suggests decisive engagement in localities, while in terms of strategy, it supports long-term urban defensive guerilla warfare. &quot;The demerit of urban guerilla warfare lies in the lack of depth and the profusion of surveillance.&quot; The merits include topographical complexity, vulnerability of the city, easiness to ambush police, and impossibility to use high-impact weapons. <br />\n<br />\nRegarding the use of physical force, it emphasizes precision. &quot;You may not be able to destroy a whole team of dogs, but you can get rid of them one by one, right?&quot; Concerning resources, it advocates feeding on the enemy's blood. &quot;An outstanding attack will earn not only police chase but also donations by a number of people plus valiant volunteers.&quot; As for public support, &quot;we got to show that we are a people's army able to protect the people.&quot; <br />\n<br />\nAs mentioned in our previous article about Team V's revolution theory, the group claims responsibility for the early October vandalism of pro-CCP enterprises and Molotov cocktail attacks. Concerning why an armed revolution is needed, it says Hongkongers have always waited in vain. &quot;In 1997 we waited for China to become democratized. In 2014 we waited for the CCP to give us alms. Today we wait for the US military to help us.&quot; It warns that if Hongkongers fail to take up their arms and fight valiantly now, the younger generation will be wiped out soon. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFul text: FB link:  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/793399724431127?__tn__=-R\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhongkongbilingualnews%2Fposts%2F793399724431127%3F__tn__%3D-R&d=Wg3pkMW64ksxbb%2FAt9Sry4yfatP4vaZW2FmQrzE7DSA%3D&h=4d31a33e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/793399724431127?__tn__=-R</a>  <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSource: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mbLVzr4vHZGtA8uuvQiolPtsVufbl7EhAFkW5dclkRk/edit?fbclid=IwAR2XcfViSTYL1lATh7n9U310iZ2XkTYvnLIb-zN1nNNlYpmIc3vNqu_G_OQ\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1mbLVzr4vHZGtA8uuvQiolPtsVufbl7EhAFkW5dclkRk%2Fedit%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2XcfViSTYL1lATh7n9U310iZ2XkTYvnLIb-zN1nNNlYpmIc3vNqu_G_OQ&d=Wg3pkMW64ksxbb%2FAt9Sry4yfatP4vaZW2FmQrzE7DSA%3D&h=58844923\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mbLVzr4vHZGtA8uuvQiolPtsVufbl7EhAFkW5dclkRk/edit?fbclid=IwAR2XcfViSTYL1lATh7n9U310iZ2XkTYvnLIb-zN1nNNlYpmIc3vNqu_G_OQ</a><br />\n<br />\nArticle on Team V's Theory: FB link: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/792721224498977?__tn__=-R\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhongkongbilingualnews%2Fposts%2F792721224498977%3F__tn__%3D-R&d=Wg3pkMW64ksxbb%2FAt9Sry4yfatP4vaZW2FmQrzE7DSA%3D&h=99d0f2d5\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/792721224498977?__tn__=-R</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n#freehongkong #extraditionlaw #hongkonghumanrightsanddemocracyact #umbrellamovement #edwardleung #donaldtrump #americanrevolution #chapmanchen #HKBNews"},{"pid":"4c51894f6bac9e72f58c8a1db1d6843cce3416c5","tid":1658705,"uid":154257,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-16T14:52:54.000Z","msg":"10月13日荃灣被捕義士post要幫手推post<br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/enFqgS\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/enFqgS</a>"},{"pid":"389aa530391aee7ee6404467eff6fd4c4d973709","tid":1658705,"uid":321050,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-16T15:03:37.000Z","msg":"Push"}]}
