In the early hours Donald Trump seems to be having an excellent night. Counting the votes cast at polling places, Trump is winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.<br />\n<br />\nThose states don&rsquo;t even begin processing mail-in ballots until Election Day, yet Trump quickly declares victory. So do many other Republican candidates. The media complains that it&rsquo;s premature, but Trumpworld is ecstatic.<br />\n<br />\nDemocrats know that as many as 40 percent of the ballots are mail-in and still being counted, and those votes are likely to be overwhelmingly for Joe Biden, but they can&rsquo;t control the emotions of that night. It&rsquo;s a gut punch.<br />\n<br />\nAs the mail-in ballots are tallied, the Trump leads erode. But the situation is genuinely unclear. Trump is on the warpath, raging about fraud.<br />\n<br />\nWithin weeks there are lawsuits and challenges everywhere. It&rsquo;s like Florida in 2000, but the chaos is happening in many states at once. Ballots are getting tossed because of problems with signatures, or not getting tossed, amid national frenzy.<br />\n<br />\nTrump says he won&rsquo;t let Democrats steal the election and declares himself re-elected. It&rsquo;s an outrage, but as when he used the White House for a campaign prop during his convention, who&rsquo;s going to stop him?<br />\n<br />\n。。。。。。。。。。<br />\n<br />\nIf Trump claims a victory that is not rightly his, a few marches in the streets will not be an adequate response. <span class=\"red\">There may have to be a sustained campaign of civic action, as in Hong Kong and Belarus, to rally the majority that wants to preserve democracy, that isolates those who would undo it.</span><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/point1.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
