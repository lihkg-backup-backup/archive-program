source<br />\nAFP 15 mins ago<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong has decided against using a jury for the first trial under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing, a legal source with direct knowledge of the case told AFP on Monday.<br />\n<br />\nSecretary for Justice Teresa Cheng informed the defendant's legal team in early February, citing &quot;the personal safety of jurors and their family members&quot;, the source said.<br />\n<br />\nInstead the trial will be heard by three judges who have been appointed to try national security cases.<br />\n<br />\nA Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment when asked by AFP because proceedings were ongoing.<br />\n<br />\nThe spokesperson for the judiciary also declined to comment &quot;on individual cases&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nTrial by jury has been used by Hong Kong's common law legal system for 176 years and is described by the city's own justice department as one of the judiciary's &quot;most important features&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nBut the new national security law -- which was imposed by fiat last June -- allows for trials to be heard by dedicated national security judges in some circumstances.<br />\n<br />\nThe first person to face trial is Tong Ying-kit, a 23-year old man arrested the day after the law came in to effect for allegedly driving his motorbike into a crowd of police officers while flying a protest flag.<br />\n<br />\nCurrently on remand, he is charged with terrorism and inciting secession -- two new national security crimes -- and faces up to life in prison if convicted.<br />\n<br />\nHis case is being handled by the High Court's Court of First Instance, where trials are usually heard by a judge alongside seven to nine jurors.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the legal source, the Secretary for Justice invoked Article 46 of the national security law, which states three instances where juries can be scrapped for national security crimes. <br />\n<br />\nThey are protecting state secrets, cases involving foreign forces and protecting the personal safety of jurors and their families.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong's Bar Association had previously raised concerns about that provision. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;The right to trial by jury can be taken away by the Secretary for Justice on certain grounds without any residual discretion in this regard being left with the courts,&quot; the association said shortly after the law was published.<br />\n<br />\nThe legal source said Tong's defence team were considering their next step.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The only possible way to fight is via judicial review,&quot; the source said.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong's internationally respected legal system has come under sustained pressure in the politically charged wake of 2019's huge pro-democracy protests and Beijing's subsequent crackdown.<br />\n<br />\nThe national security law imposed by Beijing has silenced dissent and dented the legal firewall between the business hub and the mainland.<br />\n<br />\nSenior Chinese politicians, state media outlets as well as leading pro-Beijing figures and newspapers within Hong Kong have also lobbied for reforming the judiciary or criticised recent judgments and sentences they dislike. <br />\n<br />\nOpponents fear those calls could presage the arrival of a legal system more akin to the authoritarian mainland.<br />\n<br />\nInside China, criminal courts have no juries, answer to the party and have a near-universal conviction rate."},{"pid":"ff4b9e79f591bf339d33d0bddce5c4ca3d0a142a","tid":2399885,"uid":51271,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-08T13:14:28.000Z","msg":"即係變萬能key"},{"pid":"835ddc05f277a529a14af6626afa1928d89465a9","tid":2399885,"uid":231480,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-08T13:17:48.000Z","msg":"審嚟做乜春，不如直接終身<br
