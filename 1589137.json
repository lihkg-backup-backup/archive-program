After these mobs rushed into the platform, the control center of the MTR asked the passengers to get off. If the train drove in time, it could avoid the bloody terrorist attack.<br />\n<br />\nOn 24 August, 2019, before the Kwun Tong parade, several nearby subway stations were suspended in order to cooperate with police&rsquo;s plan.<br />\n<br />\nOn 31 August, 2019 at night, the police and the MTR took the reporters out of the scene in the prince edward station. The injured were delayed for more than two hours before being sent to the hospital.<br />\nAfterwards, three serious wounded people were found to have disappeared.
