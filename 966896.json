It generates 65 per cent of human-related nitrous oxide, which has 296 times the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of CO2. Most of this comes from manure.<br />\n<br />\nAnd it accounts for respectively 37 per cent of all human-induced methane (23 times as warming as CO2), which is largely produced by the digestive system of ruminants, and 64 per cent of ammonia, which contributes significantly to acid rain.<br />\n<br />\nThe livestock business is among the most damaging sectors to the earth&rsquo;s increasingly scarce water resources, contributing among other things to water pollution from animal wastes, antibiotics and hormones, chemicals from tanneries, fertilizers and the pesticides used to spray feed crops.<br />\n<br />\nBeyond improving animal diets, proposed remedies to the multiple problems include soil conservation methods together with controlled livestock exclusion from sensitive areas; setting up biogas plant initiatives to recycle manure; improving efficiency of irrigation systems; and introducing full-cost pricing for water together with taxes to discourage large-scale livestock concentration close to cities."},{"pid":"115846b0c99af035ff88478071e7304c73519499","tid":966896,"uid":47359,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-01-03T11:05:46.000Z","msg":"唔止溫室氣體<br />\n重有<br />\nThe livestock business is among the most damaging sectors to the earth&rsquo;s increasingly scarce water resources, contributing among other things to water pollution from animal wastes, antibiotics and hormones, chemicals from tanneries, fertilizers and the pesticides used to spray feed crops.<br />\n環保撚幾時叫m記摺埋？"},{"pid":"b27ed2c5d52978520e8bc3a7794353e206ba62f2","tid":966896,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-01-03T11:49:29.000Z","msg":"環保撚：下一步要走麥樂雞醬<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/966257\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/966257</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"03cc20ac3c07f89289f0de75920753c8d52c417c","tid":966896,"uid":47359,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-01-04T13:01:16.000Z","msg":"."}]}
