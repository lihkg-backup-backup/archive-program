This principle, underpinned by the common law system, provides Hong Kong with the foundations for its continued success as a truly global financial centre and prosperous world city.<br />\n<br />\nLet me turn to the current issues around the ramifications of the Hong Kong Government&rsquo;s contentious proposals to change their extradition laws. Yesterday&rsquo;s huge protest march&mdash;peaceful right up until the end&mdash;was a clear demonstration of the strength of feeling in Hong Kong. Hong Kong&rsquo;s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, has insisted that new legislation is needed to close a loophole that has prevented a Hong Kong national accused of murdering another Hong Kong national in Taiwan from facing justice, yet the Taiwanese Administration also oppose the changes, while civil society and business and legal groups in Hong Kong have expressed the strongest concerns about the content of the proposals and the very short consultation period.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">Many fear above all that Hong Kong nationals and residents risk being pulled into China&rsquo;s legal system, which can involve lengthy pre-trial detentions, televised confessions and an absence of many of the judicial safeguards that we see in Hong Kong and in the UK. </span>While we welcome recent efforts by the Hong Kong Government to react to the unprecedented level of public concern&mdash;of the 7 million people living in Hong Kong, between 300,000 and 1 million were on the streets yesterday&mdash;the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is clear that the changes proposed fail to address fully some core issues that we and others have raised.<br />\n<br />\nThe UK Government have been unequivocal in their views. From the outset, the consul general, Andy Heyn, and my officials have been raising concerns with the Hong Kong Government, members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and the Executive Council at all levels. We have also had full and detailed discussions with Chief Executive Carrie Lam, both bilaterally and as part of an EU d&eacute;marche. On 30 May, the Foreign Secretary issued a joint statement with his Canadian counterpart on the potential impact of the proposals on our citizens in Hong Kong, including on business confidence and on Hong Kong&rsquo;s international reputation.<br />\n<br />\nSome Hong Kong lawmakers have proposed an array of alternative solutions, including that additional legally binding human rights safeguards be included in the proposed legislation. In my meeting in London on 20 May with Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Edward Yau, I made it clear that proper consideration must be given to all these suggestions as part of a wider and more comprehensive consultation. More time for consultation would allow for a more adequate consensus to be built.<br />\n<br />\nAs the House will be aware, the operation of the court system on mainland China is very different from that which applies in Hong Kong. There are widespread concerns that fear of extradition to China might have a chilling effect on Hong Kong&rsquo;s rights and freedoms and result in increased self-censorship. We shall continue to stress to the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities that for confidence in the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; policy to be maintained, Hong Kong must enjoy the full measure of its high degree of autonomy and rule of law as set out in the joint declaration and enshrined in the Basic Law.<br />\n<br />\nto be continued..."},{"pid":"06cbd91b5eba928c4ef1d3f2bef0c6777d19dc27","tid":1200545,"uid":170229,"like":35,"dislike":0,"score":35,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-10T18:44:23.000Z","msg":"Catherine West<br />\nIt is very disappointing that the Secretary of State could not make it to the Chamber for the 1 million Hong Kong residents who took to the streets yesterday to protest against their Government&rsquo;s proposed extradition Bill. If enacted, the law would allow suspected criminals to be extradited to mainland China, bypassing Hong Kong&rsquo;s independent legal system. <span style=\"color: red;\">Over the past few weeks, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the business community, civil society organisations, the Hong Kong Bar Association and the International Chamber of Commerce have all expressed deep concern that the Bill will<strong> further erode</strong> the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; model.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">The law courts on mainland China are seen as an arm of the state. Forced confession is frequently practised and activists often fear imprisonment for crimes they have not committed.</span> Hong Kong&rsquo;s common law system is not open to such abuse, as the Minister mentioned in his introductory remarks, and although it is under pressure, the separation of powers remains more or less intact. The amendments to the extradition law would significantly compromise the firewall that separates the sharply different systems.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">In recent times, we have watched with great unease as political and civic freedoms have been put under increasing strain.</span> Those freedoms are guaranteed under the Basic Law, a core component of the Sino-British joint declaration. As the co-signatory to that treaty, which is registered at the United Nations, <span style=\"color: red;\">the Government have a legal duty to ensure that it is upheld.</span><br />\n<br />\nThe last Governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten of Barnes, said that this Bill&rsquo;s provisions were<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;an assault on Hong Kong&rsquo;s values, stability and security. They create fear and uncertainty&hellip;at a time when we should all be working to safeguard Hong Kong&rsquo;s reputation as one of the world&rsquo;s greatest business&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nand cultural centres. Does the Minister agree with his colleague&rsquo;s assessment, and <strong><span style=\"color: red;\">will he outline how the Government intend to address this issue in the immediate future, alongside long-standing concerns about the erosion of democratic principles in Hong Kong?</span></strong><br />\n<br />\nWe have a long and enduring history with Hong Kong, and we have lasting political, economic and cultural ties.

Lady for the tone of her comments. She will be aware from discussions that we have had&mdash;and I have visited Hong Kong twice already during my time as a Minister&mdash;that we understand many of the concerns which have been raised by Lord Patten and, indeed, by her. In particular, we understand the concerns raised in the most recent six-monthly report&mdash;not without some controversy do we continue to have a six-monthly report&mdash;which states that, <span style=\"color: red;\">while we believe that one country, two systems is working well, in the sphere of civil and political freedoms Hong Kong&rsquo;s high degree of autonomy is being reduced.</span><br />\n<br />\nLet me say this in relation to the joint declaration as a whole. Three years ago, in 2016, we called on a breach of the declaration following the involuntary removal of the Causeway Bay booksellers from Hong Kong to the mainland. That was the first and, to date, the only time that we have called upon a breach. However, it is clear that these events are becoming close to breaching not just the spirit but the letter of the joint declaration. I fear that this is also a good example of tough cases making bad law. There is a potential loophole, but it is interesting to note that it is not one that the Taiwanese authorities have asked to be sorted out.<br />\n<br />\nA Hong Kong national is being accused of a very serious crime&mdash;murder&mdash;and there is clearly no extradition prospect, but, as the hon. Lady rightly pointed out, this opens up a potentially much broader extradition-related concern. As I mentioned in my initial comments, one of the biggest concerns is that, particularly at a time when President Xi has a strong anti-corruption campaign in place, there is a risk that individuals could be caught up in this in a very inadvertent way. While there are proposed safeguards&mdash;it is proposed to raise the extradition level from a three-year custodial sentence to one of at least seven years&mdash;the situation none the less still raises the deep concerns to which the hon.

I hope that the work of democracy and diplomacy will ensure that we are able to do our best not only to push back but to advise and express our deep concerns. We have only to look at the recent six-monthly reports to recognise the increasing buzz of concern on our side and indeed from many in Hong Kong in relation to this matter. In particular, the extradition treaty has engaged many in the business community, many of whom have felt broadly positive over the past 22 years. One of the messages we put to our counterparts in Beijing is that a strong Hong Kong is required for their own plans, whether on the belt and road or other economic initiatives, to be fully successful. Hong Kong&rsquo;s unique legal system provides an opportunity for substantial capital markets.

The Minister for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field依然信一國兩制的整體運作同和平外交。佢認為今次只係個別事件，特區政府原意唔係差，希望能以國際施壓去解決今次危機，唔敢想像如果送中法極速推過會點算。不過有指出台灣當局唔支持送中。<br />\nTLDR:想繼續玩外交，唔做實事，但可能BNO會有搞作。<br />\n<br />\n2. Catherine West 指出大量機構都反送中，認為此法更進一步侵蝕一國兩制(暗示佢認為一國兩制早已被侵蝕)。同時指出中共司法機關為國家服務。佢為近期香港的政治及個人自由日益被限制，而英國政府有法律責任去保障香港人權。佢質問政府如何即時回應今次事年同考慮長期抵抗民主被侵蝕的做法。<br />\nTLDR: 政府要實驗對港人的承諾:香港永遠唔會單打獨鬥&ldquo;Hong Kong will never walk alone&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n3.

Field<br />\nI thank the hon. Lady for her comments, although I think some of them are a little unkind to officials, Ministers and also more particularly our excellent consul general, Andy Heyn, who has been out in Hong Kong, as we have recognised that this issue has been emerging for quite some time. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, it is also fair to say that we have consistently, certainly in my two years as a Minister, at every six-monthly report expressed ongoing concerns about the deterioration, as we have seen it, in political and civil rights.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">It is probably fair to say that these proposals&mdash;the proposed extradition law&mdash;did not originate at China&rsquo;s instigation, but there is no doubt that the Hong Kong Government are now under distinct pressure from Beijing.</span> We believe that some opportunities to climb down have been missed, <span style=\"color: red;\">but even the huge public display of defiance yesterday&mdash;as I have said, up until the last few moments it was very peaceable&mdash;combined with concerted opposition from the international business and legal communities has not been able to turn the tide.</span><br />\n<br />\nI say to the hon. Lady that of course we will do all we can. Andy Heyn is I believe in London this week, but his very able assistant Esther Blythe is back in Hong Kong, and we will do all we can to make further urgent representations to the Hong Kong Government.<br />\n<br />\nThis issue has highlighted that it is not the Chief Executive and not even the Legislative Council that can provide an effective check to external influence in Hong Kong; it is the presence and continuation of an independent judicial system. Obviously, again as the hon. Lady rightly alluded to, it now looks as though we are heading towards a potential pitting of the Hong Kong judicial system squarely against that of Beijing."},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-10T22:26:03.000Z","msg":"遊左咁耐花園終於表態<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"09433cc6bf286b1227912058e1b7ca1169c4ffc7","tid":1200545,"uid":238299,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"quote":{"pid":"06cbd91b5eba928c4ef1d3f2bef0c6777d19dc27","tid":1200545,"uid":170229,"like":35,"dislike":0,"score":35,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-10T18:44:23.000Z","msg":"Catherine West<br />\nIt is very disappointing that the Secretary of State could not make it to the Chamber for the 1 million Hong Kong residents who took to the streets yesterday to protest against their Government&rsquo;s proposed extradition Bill. If enacted, the law would allow suspected criminals to be extradited to mainland China, bypassing Hong Kong&rsquo;s independent legal system. <span style=\"color: red;\">Over the past few weeks, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the business community, civil society organisations, the Hong Kong Bar Association and the International Chamber of Commerce have all expressed deep concern that the Bill will<strong> further erode</strong> the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; model.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">The law courts on mainland China are seen as an arm of the state. Forced confession is frequently practised and activists often fear imprisonment for crimes they have not committed.</span> Hong Kong&rsquo;s common law system is not open to such abuse, as the Minister mentioned in his introductory remarks, and although it is under pressure, the separation of powers remains more or less intact. The amendments to the extradition law would significantly compromise the firewall that separates the sharply different systems.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">In recent times, we have watched with great unease as political and civic freedoms have been put under increasing strain.</span> Those freedoms are guaranteed under the Basic Law, a core component of the Sino-British joint declaration.
