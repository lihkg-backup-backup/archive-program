The second source, a lawmaker, said the announcement could come as soon as Saturday when Mahathir is expected to name members of his new cabinet.<br />\n<br />\nMahathir had vowed to investigate the scandal if elected and bring missing funds back to Malaysia. On Thursday, he said that if Najib had done anything wrong he would &ldquo;face the

The short answer to that is: quick gains. Since President Macri took office, the Argentine Central Bank greatly expanded its issuance of Lebac (short for Letras del Banco Central, or Central Bank Notes), short-term Argentine bonds with fantastically high interest rates.<br />\n</span><br />\nInvestors could exchange their dollars for pesos, invest in Lebac bonds - which mature in as little as 35 days and provide a yearly interest rate of 29% - and then sell their pesos for dollars again. This practice is called carry trade and it was done by all sorts of investors, from big banks to small savers.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: orange;\">For some time, investors just rolled debt on from one bond to another. But in April, many began to leave Argentina, fearing President Macri would not be able to deliver on his promise to bring down inflation.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: orange;\">Moreover, with the prospect of the US raising its own interest rates, many considered they had made enough money in Argentina and it was time to recalibrate risks.</span> Like a poker player on a winning streak, investors felt the odds of the next bet being a losing one were increasing with time. <span style=\"color: orange;\">The mass exit made the peso lose almost a quarter of its value.</span><br />\n<br />\nArgentines have been through so much economic turmoil, they are not quick to panic. Many of the people I spoke to in Buenos Aires last week shrugged off the crisis and stoically replied: &quot;We're from Argentina. We are used to this&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nUnder President Macri, Argentina went from being an economy that relied on government overspending to one that relied on debt issued to volatile foreign investors.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: orange;\">Many believe Mr Macri is doomed, especially as going to the IMF is the most unpopular move a president could make in Argentina, where the organisation is widely loathed and blamed for the 2001 economic collapse.</span> The president is trying to project confidence. He still has hopes of being re-elected next year but for that to happen he will need to contain this crisis soon."},{"pid":"2267b6a66ba1f234bf8fdce23b8cf7067b9b96ad","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-15T10:10:31.000Z","msg":"國際關係評論員之間的花生: <br />\n<br />\n韓半島新聞平台怒屌香港「韓國專家」鍾樂偉 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/knewsonline/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fknewsonline%2F&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=67b0f2d9\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/knewsonline/</a>"},{"pid":"d54f2935704c7eca249a0569977bafd72e68891e","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-15T10:27:23.000Z","msg":"之前有巴打點南非咩事，係度貼翻先<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">South Africa direct rule for North West province<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44101133\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-africa-44101133&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=be46a40d\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-africa-44101133&h=e8bcaf19\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44101133</a><br />\n<br />\nSouth Africa has taken over direct administration of North West province where corruption allegations have led to violent protests.<br />\n<br />\nThere have also been calls for the regional premier to resign.<br />\n<br />\nThe decision to intervene was taken by President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has made the fight against corruption a priority.<br />\n<br />\nThe province's regional premier, Supra Mahumapelo - a political ally of former President Jacob Zuma - has refused to step down but went on leave.

President Donald Trump has contradicted his own national security adviser, saying the so-called &quot;Libya model&quot; for denuclearisation is not being pursued with North Korea.<br />\n<br />\nThe suggestion by John Bolton angered the North, which threatened to pull out of a summit with Mr Trump next month.<br />\n<br />\nMr Trump said he still thought a summit would happen.<br />\n<br />\nNorth Korea was apparently referencing an interview Mr Bolton gave comparing it to &quot;the Libya model&quot; of denuclearisation.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2003, Libya's Colonel Muammar Gaddafi agreed to give up his country's programmes of weapons of mass destruction in an announcement that surprised the world. Most US sanctions on Libya were lifted within a few months and diplomatic ties between the countries restored. The North African country came in from the cold.<br />\n<br />\nBut in 2011 the authoritarian leader was toppled by rebels and militiamen backed by Nato. He was later captured and killed by rebel forces."},{"pid":"2d072881ac5d497fa806fa30dcd9842f8de8a08f","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-18T04:52:58.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">EU to reactivate 'blocking statute' against US sanctions on Iran for European firms<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/eu-to-reactivate-blocking-statute-against-us-sanctions-on-iran-for-european-firms/a-43826992\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Feu-to-reactivate-blocking-statute-against-us-sanctions-on-iran-for-european-firms%2Fa-43826992&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=4213003f\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dw.com/en/eu-to-reactivate-blocking-statute-against-us-sanctions-on-iran-for-european-firms/a-43826992</a><br />\n<br />\nEuropean Union Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced Thursday that the bloc plans to reactivate a law that would seek to block European companies from complying with any sanctions the US would reintroduce against Iran.<br />\n<br />\nJuncker's announcement came during the second day of an EU meeting in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, which had already been marked by sharp criticism from European leaders over American President Donald Trump's decision to pull the US out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.<br />\n<br />\nA blocking statute is a law enacted in a local jurisdiction that attempts to hinder application of a law made by a foreign jurisdiction. The 1996 legislation protects &quot;against the effects of the extra-territorial application of legislation adopted by a third country.&quot; <br />\n<br />\nIt was originally developed to get around a US trade embargo on Cuba and sanctions related to Iran and Libya, though it was never enacted because the disagreements were settled politically. In the current proposed application, the law would attempt to shield European companies that do business with Iran from future US sanctions by prohibiting the companies from respecting US sanctions. It also would not recognize any court rulings that enforce the American-issued penalties."},{"pid":"fbe0cdc7b160979ef9fd713dc53d339371c007b3","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-18T04:53:30.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">US Senate confirms Gina Haspel as CIA head despite role in torture program<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/us-senate-confirms-gina-haspel-as-cia-head-despite-role-in-torture-program/a-43831582\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Fus-senate-confirms-gina-haspel-as-cia-head-despite-role-in-torture-program%2Fa-43831582&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=28684840\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dw.com/en/us-senate-confirms-gina-haspel-as-cia-head-despite-role-in-torture-program/a-43831582</a><br />\n<br />\nThe US Senate voted 54-45 in favor of Gina Haspel's nomination on Thursday, making her the first woman to head the CIA.

A victim of torture as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, he had urged Senate colleagues to reject Haspel's nomination.<br />\n<br />\nSix Democrats, four of whom face re-election in the fall in states where President Donald Trump is popular, joined Republicans in voting for Haspel.

In a debate that divides Ireland so deeply down the middle, it is one of the few statements everyone can agree on.<br />\n<br />\nThe near-total ban on abortion currently in place was adopted as the &quot;Eight Amendment&quot; to the Irish constitution. This clause, passed in a contentious referendum, aimed to stop Ireland's courts following the lead of other countries and introducing abortion without the approval of the legislature. But what was intended as a complete ban on termination has not turned out this way: a landmark case in 1992, involving a suicidal teenage rape victim known only as &quot;X,&quot; found that abortion could be permitted in cases where the pregnancy poses a &quot;real and substantial&quot; risk to the mother's life.<br />\n<br />\nThese are the &quot;hard cases&quot; cited by &quot;Yes&quot; campaigners as grounds to remove this 1983 prohibition &mdash; in their own words, to &quot;Repeal the Eighth.&quot; &quot;The Eighth amendment has not worked,&quot; Ireland's health minister, Simon Harris, told DW. Harris sponsored the parliamentary legislation to bring about Friday's vote. &quot;If its aim was to stop abortions, by any measure it has failed. Every day nine Irish women go to the UK for a termination, and at least three Irish women take abortion pills illegally without any medical supervision. You need to be able to legislate and put a legal and clinical framework around such sensitive issues.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThis is why Harris and his colleagues are proposing to repeal the Eighth Amendment, replacing it with a provision removing the constraints on parliament, so that lawmakers can pass whatever abortion law they see fit. Harris's proposals would include allowing abortion in cases of &quot;fatal fetal abnormality,&quot; as well as where pregnancy poses a serious risk to a woman's health."},{"pid":"d2d853c31aadc7b2f40378cb00c126b90e3153bd","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-05-25T06:10:43.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">North Korea ready to talk 'at any time' with Donald Trump<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44248256\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-asia-44248256&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=a42ac4c9\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-asia-44248256&h=1ab1b1e4\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44248256</a><br />\n<br />\nNorth Korea has said it is still willing to talk &quot;at any time in any form&quot; after US President Donald Trump abruptly cancelled his meeting with Kim Jong-un.<br />\n<br />\nVice-foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan said Mr Trump's decision was &quot;extremely regrettable&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nPresident Trump blamed the North's &quot;open hostility&quot; for the cancellation.<br />\n<br />\nThe summit would have been the first time a sitting US president had met a North Korean leader.<br />\n<br />\nThe details of the meeting in Singapore on 12 June were unclear.

The high-risk activity is known as proprietary trading.<br />\n<br />\nThe proposed changes would match the strictest applications of the rule to banks that do the most trading &ndash; 18 banks with at least $10bn in trading assets and liabilities. They account for 95% of all US bank trading and include some foreign banks with US operations, Fed officials said.<br />\n<br />\nLess stringent requirements would apply to banks that do less trading. The idea is to make it easier for banks to comply with the Volcker Rule without sacrificing the banks&rsquo; safety and soundness, the officials said.<br />\n<br />\nLast week, Congress approved legislation rolling back the Dodd-Frank law, giving Trump a key win on a campaign promise as he quickly signed it into law. The Republican-led legislation, passed with help from some opposition votes, was aimed at especially helping small and medium-sized banks, including community banks and credit unions. It eases oversight and capital requirements (and Volcker Rule compliance) for about two dozen banks falling below new capital thresholds, including BB&amp;T, SunTrust Banks, Fifth Third Bank and American Express."},{"pid":"7839c6a6d7095d7d7323732e57a2df93dedc5b1a","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-31T04:50:02.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Key North Korea official meets Pompeo in New York<br />\n</strong></span><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44309961\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-us-canada-44309961&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=046e145b\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-us-canada-44309961&h=1b180c0c\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44309961</a><br />\n<br />\nThe right-hand man to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York to discuss a historic summit.<br />\n<br />\nGen Kim Yong-chol dined with Mr Pompeo after flying in from China and the two are due to meet again on Thursday.<br />\n<br />\nHe is the most senior North Korean to visit the US in nearly 20 years.<br />\n<br />\nUS President Donald Trump previously cancelled the 12 June summit, but both sides have since made fresh efforts to hold it as planned.<br />\n<br />\nScheduled to happen in Singapore, the historic meeting would be the first between sitting US and North Korean leaders."},{"pid":"3bb56c89fde2f5eaf33ae18c9d15b60c2c0f7094","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-05-31T08:25:49.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">North Korea: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrives for talks<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/north-korea-russian-foreign-minister-sergey-lavrov-arrives-for-talks/a-44016043\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Fnorth-korea-russian-foreign-minister-sergey-lavrov-arrives-for-talks%2Fa-44016043&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=0178a113\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dw.com/en/north-korea-russian-foreign-minister-sergey-lavrov-arrives-for-talks/a-44016043</a><br />\n<br />\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrived in North Korea on Thursday for talks with senior officials.<br />\n<br />\nThe visit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts by Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington to restore a meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un, originally scheduled for June 12 in Singapore but later canceled by Trump.<br />\n<br />\nLavrov met with his North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho and others at the Supreme People's Assembly building in the North Korean capital.

Rajoy did not attend the afternoon session of the debate on Thursday.<br />\n<br />\nIf he did, the motion would automatically become groundless and the government of the People&rsquo;s Party would go into caretaker mode until a new prime minister is sworn in, something which could take several weeks or months.<br />\n<br />\nIf the vote did go ahead and Rajoy lost it, then Sanchez would immediately become Prime Minister."},{"pid":"f3ae88acf17aefa8a31d8588b16b24bc23ca86bd","tid":659239,"uid":181649,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"0806d43ac45fe4f858d235649e0995a9cce7e9ca","tid":659239,"uid":35305,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"45ffbb349c3b2d3dc7cbb1ce2004cfdde0e5e108","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"b6614fe9e86ae7eaa9e1b84ca885bc395226cbcf","tid":659239,"uid":35305,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-05-31T14:14:34.000Z","msg":"加拿大同墨西哥唔係同美國已簽訂自由貿易協定，乜可以自行增加關稅？<br />\n<br />\n同埋EU點都係美國傳統盟友，如果話中國同俄羅斯搞獨裁、國家資本主義要制裁，我相信無乜人反對，但打EU會唔會影響將來美國國家利益？<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/26.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-05-31T14:22:38.000Z","msg":"應該係用咗國家安全做藉口咗去加關稅，同時想係同加拿大及墨西哥的自由貿易協定的再談判中攞著數，不過加拿大出到聲話No deal better than a bad deal 咁<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-05-31T14:31:38.000Z","msg":"依家美國係西太平洋同中國打貿易戰、係中東退出核協議同伊朗反面，依家打加拿大、墨西哥同EU，Trump真係當自己係葉問可以一個打十個<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/30.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n剛剛又有消息話Trump想出手搞德國車，美國同EU開拖普京是不是最開心<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/10.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-06-01T01:47:36.000Z","msg":"如果佢搞德國車, 只係再次證明佢真係on9黎<br />\n美國啲德國車,好似BMW咁同Daimler, 係o係美國開廠, 請美國人整, 再賣返畀美國市場<br />\n一ban左德國車, 咁間廠就無本身存在意義, 最少會停工/轉生產方向, 只會cut人<br />\n根本個brand係外國, 但係made in USA<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n收加拿大同墨西哥鋁鐵稅又係on9<br />\n加拿大係美國最大嘅鐵材進出口市場,上年有17%鐵(5.8MMT)由加拿大輸入, 美國有49%鐵(4.8MMT)係向加拿大出口<br />\n個數據係美國商務部旗下嘅國際貿易委員會(ITA)出<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/imports-us.pdf\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trade.gov%2Fsteel%2Fcountries%2Fpdfs%2Fimports-us.pdf&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=b5dc89ab\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/imports-us.pdf</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/exports-us.pdf\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trade.gov%2Fsteel%2Fcountries%2Fpdfs%2Fexports-us.pdf&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=5031a799\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/exports-us.pdf</a><br />\n佢呢啲係雙敗俱傷拳, 損人不利己<br />\n2002年Bush收鐵稅已經衰過一次, 發現對其他行業嘅衝擊, 會完全抵消製鐵業嘅得益有找<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n16年後又玩多鑊, 今次仲要搞埋加拿大<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e886eb9fa9c2f0682133a7f2396b42d005c45a6c","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-01T02:42:54.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Italy government: Giuseppe Conte to head populist coalition<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44322429\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-europe-44322429&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=d6ef78a4\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-europe-44322429&h=00647034\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44322429</a><br />\n<br />\nA coalition government has been agreed in Italy, ending months of uncertainty in the EU's fourth-biggest economy.<br />\n<br />\nPrime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte presented his list of ministers to President Sergio Mattarella for the second time in a week and the new government will be sworn in on Friday.<br />\n<br />\nMinisters are drawn from both the anti-establishment Five Star (M5S) and the right-wing League.<br />\n<br />\nMr Mattarella rejected Mr Conte's original choice for economy minister but a different candidate was agreed on Thursday.<br />\n<br />\nIn the end, the populist parties decided to back down and accept the president's veto of their original choice of a eurosceptic economy minister.

tariffs -- thinking, now naively, there&rsquo;d be a perk to being a neighbor, ally and largest buyer of U.S. goods. Trudeau had bitten his tongue through skirmishes over airplanes, lumber and North American Free Trade Agreement talks.<br />\n<br />\nThat all changed Thursday when Canada, along with Mexico and the European Union, lost exemptions to the U.S. metal tariffs.<br />\n<br />\nTrudeau tore into the Trump administration, if only by the standards of stereotypical Canadian politeness. He fired back with tariffs on U.S. exports of everything from whisky to motorboats to orange juice.<span style=\"color: orange;\"> He said the legal basis of tariffs -- U.S. national security -- was an affront to Canadian soldiers who died fighting alongside Americans in numerous global battles.</span><br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Let me be clear: These tariffs are totally unacceptable,&rdquo; a visibly frustrated Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa, calling the measures inconceivable and deplorable. <span style=\"color: orange;\">&ldquo;This is not about the American people. We have to believe that at some point, their common sense will prevail but we see no sign of that in this action today.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s a tone change for the &ldquo;sunny ways&rdquo; Trudeau. Canada is a close U.S. military ally and the top U.S. export market, more than the U.K., Japan and Germany combined. It sells the U.S. more steel and aluminum than anyone else, in part because of deeply integrated auto and defense sectors. <span style=\"color: orange;\">Trudeau cracked down on Chinese steel imports for Trump, and U.S. data show that it has a trade surplus with Canada. None of it mattered.</span><br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;There was the broad lines of a decent win-win-win deal on the table that I thought required that final deal-making moment,&rdquo; he said. <span style=\"color: orange;\">Then Vice President Mike Pence called and said Trudeau could only see Trump if he agreed to a U.S. demand for a Nafta sunset clause. Trudeau refused and the meeting never happened.</span><br />\n<br />\nBuoying Trudeau&rsquo;s tone change is near-unanimity in Canada about the tariffs.<span style=\"color: orange;\"> Opposition parties have largely supported Trudeau&rsquo;s approach with Trump and on Nafta. </span>The nation&rsquo;s largest private-sector union, Unifor, applauded the retaliatory tariffs. &ldquo;Make no mistake &mdash; this is a full-on trade war,&rdquo; President Jerry Dias said."},{"pid":"c0cc4327964d65fe20408fb9942b1b0899d5389f","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-01T14:13:06.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Political novice Giuseppe Conte sworn in as Italy's new PM</strong><br />\n </span><br />\n<a href=\"http://p.dw.com/p/2yoLM\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fp.dw.com%2Fp%2F2yoLM&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=c51c7ec0\" target=\"_blank\">http://p.dw.com/p/2yoLM</a><span style=\"color: red;\"></span><br />\n<br />\nGiuseppe Conte was sworn in as Italy's 58th prime minister on Friday, ending weeks of political turmoil that rocked financial markets and prompted concerns from the country's European Union partners.<br />\n<br />\nPresident Sergio Mattarella initially refused to approve Conte's government last weekend.

Now their calls for change have borne fruit: Prime Minister Hani Mulki stepped down on Monday. As public discontent continued to grow, he decided to offer his resignation to King Abdullah II, who accepted it and commissioned Minister of Education Omar al-Razzaz to form a new government.<br />\n<br />\nThe protests were triggered by new austerity measures pushed for by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its guidelines for Jordan. They stipulated that the income tax be raised by at least 5 percent, and corporate taxes be increased by as much as 40 percent.<br />\n<br />\nThe Jordanians' anger, however, runs deeper, says Tim Petschulat, head of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation's Amman office. According to a study by The Economist magazine, Amman is the most expensive capital in the entire Arab world. The cost of living is significantly higher than that of Dubai or Abu Dhabi, but with much lower salaries.<br />\n<br />\nJordan's geographic location compounds the problems it faces, says Amman-based freelance journalist Rana Sabbagh. The country has no natural resources and conflicts in some of its neighboring countries force the government to invest a large part of its budget into its security and military apparatus.<br />\n<br />\nThe protests of the past few days have brought more people out on the streets than ever before &mdash; even more than in 2011, when a wave of uprisings spread through much of the Arab world. One thing is striking this time around, says Sabbagh: The current demonstrators are decidedly secular. &quot;It's not the Islamists, who are constantly attempting to dominate everything,&quot; she notes. &quot;The people who are demonstrating now belong to what remains of the middle class. They are young Jordanians.&quot;"},{"pid":"e11544cb0309a2d734a89bbb27e21bb83db56f21","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T04:36:27.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Paul Manafort tampering with witnesses, say Mueller investigators<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/05/paul-manafort-tampering-with-witnesses-say-mueller-investigators\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2018%2Fjun%2F05%2Fpaul-manafort-tampering-with-witnesses-say-mueller-investigators&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=c42cfc8d\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/05/paul-manafort-tampering-with-witnesses-say-mueller-investigators</a><br />\n<br />\nFederal investigators have accused Donald Trump&rsquo;s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, of tampering with potential witnesses while on bail ahead of his federal bank fraud and tax case.<br />\n<br />\nProsecutors asked that the judge overseeing his case &ldquo;revoke or revise&rdquo; the order releasing him ahead of trial.<br />\n<br />\nIn a court filing on Monday, prosecutors working for the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, said Manafort and an associate &ldquo;repeatedly&rdquo; attempted to contact witnesses using his phone and an encrypted messaging application.

(Reuters) - The United States has nearly completed a second list of tariffs on $100 billion in Chinese goods, as President Donald Trump prepares to enact an initial round of duties that is expected to trigger an in-kind response from Beijing, several sources said.<br />\n<br />\nThe second wave of products has been cued up as Washington prepares to announce on Friday a list of about $50 billion of

I suspect that some of these results just show Americans&rsquo; innumeracy &mdash; most blacks are Democratic-leaning, but most Democratic voters are not black. But I wanted to highlight this research in part because I think it speaks to the political moment we are in, and the study&rsquo;s findings fit well with other recent research on political polarization. Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, published a book earlier this year that I highly recommend called &ldquo;Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity.&rdquo; In describing American politics today, she argues that partisan identity (Democrat or Republican) has become a &ldquo;mega-identity&rdquo; because it increasingly combines a number of different identities.<br />\n<br />\nIn other words, if you told someone on the phone whom you had never met before that you are white, that single fact would not tell them much more about you. But if you told them that you are a Republican, they could reasonably assume that you are not black, lesbian, gay, transgender or bisexual, nonreligious or Jewish.<br />\n<br />\nSo we are in a situation where Americans have sorted themselves into two parties along not just ideological lines, but also by geographical, religious, racial and other social and cultural differences. At the same time, they&rsquo;ve adopted inaccurate, caricatured views of both parties that overstate these already sizable demographic differences.

The chancellor said the deal would balance national and international approaches to the issue of how to control migration.<br />\n<br />\nSeehofer, who confirmed he would be staying on as interior minister, said he was &quot;very satisfied&quot; with the &quot;clear deal&quot; reached by Germany's two conservative parties to &quot;stem illegal migration.&quot; He added that the transit centers would help speed up asylum decisions and, in negative cases, accelerate deportations.<br />\n<br />\nThe general secretaries of the two parties said the agreement would reduce migration to Germany and allow the country to quickly turn away people who have no chance of being granted asylum in the country.<br />\n<br />\nThe deal seems to have buried the issue of whether Germany would have the authority to turn away migrants at its national borders, a main point of disagreement between conservatives that had threatened to break apart the long-standing CDU-CSU parliamentary bloc.<br />\n<br />\nBut there's a third player in this equation. On Monday, as Merkel was meeting with her CSU counterpart, Social Democratic Party (SPD) chairwoman Andrea Nahles said the SPD would only be guided by its coalition agreement with the CDU-CSU, not by Seehofer's master plan.<br />\n<br />\nAfter negotiating their deal late on Monday, Merkel and Seehofer discussed the arrangement with the SPD at a coalition committee meeting. Talks broke off early Tuesday, with Nahles saying many issues still needed to be clarified before the SPD could approve the deal."},{"pid":"f25c3a11cf1065087f4958c92cf717265300b8a3","tid":659239,"uid":26752,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-03T03:40:53.000Z","msg":"左膠總統<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/07/01/trudeau-groping-allegation_a_23472348/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.ca%2F2018%2F07%2F01%2Ftrudeau-groping-allegation_a_23472348%2F&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=a4410c99\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/07/01/trudeau-groping-allegation_a_23472348/</a>"},{"pid":"48cdf2c23504cc152eaf6b5130fba5b380b9d995","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-03T08:32:49.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Former PM Najib arrested at his residence<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/432480\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malaysiakini.com%2Fnews%2F432480&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=b0433ea5\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/432480</a><br />\n<br />\nPolice and MACC sources have claimed that former premier Najib Abdul Razak has been arrested at his residence in Jalan Duta, Kuala Lumpur, this afternoon.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, MACC head Shukri Abdull could not confirm the matter.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I am meeting with the IGP now.

The budget is set to go to the Cabinet for approval on Friday. <br />\n<br />\nDefense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, who has pledged to end spending cuts for the armed forces, had criticized the initial budget proposal as insufficient.

Chinese firms would invest and seek contracts abroad, which would make them more competitive globally while alleviating some of the pressures of a domestic market that was starting to saturate. At the same time, the move would allow Chinese firms to secure new markets for their exports. The policy was supported by cheap and easy credit from China&rsquo;s policy banks.<br />\n<br />\nChinese firms responded to these incentives. Fueled by easy credit and the impetus to go out, many of them have been taking increasingly risky projects. Unsurprisingly, many of these projects have underperformed massively. And the impacts for Chinese banks, and through them the Chinese economy, are now becoming visible.<br />\n<br />\nThe Sicomines case is not unusual. China&rsquo;s mammoth firms frequently make massive losses on foreign investment ventures.<br />\n<br />\nThrough the Go Out policy and the Belt and Road Initiative, China&rsquo;s firms have been economically and politically incentivized to invest in countries where they have little to no experience. Chinese President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative has backed the Go Out policy&rsquo;s economic incentives with a healthy dose of political pressure, reflecting China&rsquo;s desire to have its economic rise matched by political clout. Chinese firms lack the experience of their Western counterparts when investing abroad; some Western investments date back to colonial times. Because of their late entry into new markets, Chinese firms may also be more likely to invest in lemons &mdash; projects deemed too unprofitable or risky by other investors. Chinese firms have also been taking on projects that are far outside their field of competence. The Sicomines deal is a case in point, resulting in two Chinese construction giants now sharing a controlling stake in a copper mine.<br />\n<br />\nThe possibility has been raised that Chinese firms may be in a haste to invest in large projects, regardless of risk, because they aim to become too big to fail, with the expectation that they will be bailed out even if they throw money down the drain. They may also be seeking to transfer assets abroad to shield them from the state&rsquo;s prying hands should their political fortunes turn."},{"pid":"3089f643f70ab5ead930456409df41b625d78915","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-05T10:06:03.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Downing Street sets out some details of new Brexit customs plan<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44719576\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fuk-politics-44719576&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=586dcaf0\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fuk-politics-44719576&h=2981b6d5\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44719576</a><br />\n<br />\nDowning Street has set out some of the detail of how customs could be handled after Brexit.<br />\n<br />\nNo 10 says its new plan - dubbed the &quot;facilitated customs arrangement&quot; - offers &quot;the best of both worlds&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nThe details come as Theresa May and Angela Merkel prepare to discuss the progress of Brexit negotiations when they hold talks in Berlin later.<br />\n<br />\nThe UK prime minister is facing calls from the EU to clarify the UK's position.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Number 10, the new plan would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country.

之前在臉書專頁寫過，很少在網誌寫英國脫歐談判進展，是因為脫歐問題紛紛擾擾，但雜音多，實際其實無進展，箇中關鍵在於，文翠珊一直不能就想如何離開歐盟提出一套確實的想法。戴德偉辭職，說明了為何文翠珊遲遲不能提出方案，只能說些「Brexit means Brexit」的廢話。她一提出方案，就是要在硬脫歐及軟脫歐之間作出抉擇，她上任兩年，她（及全英國）都還是未想到可討好兩邊的中間落墨方案，而她一旦選邊站，一定會有重要閣員以不滿脫歐方案為由而辭職抗議，一定有其中一派表示會找人挑戰她的保守黨黨魁及首相地位。<br />\n<br />\n戴德偉辭職也有個人因素。文翠珊去年把脫歐事務部常任秘書長Olly Robbins調去首相府，出任自己的脫歐事務顧問後，戴德偉領導的脫歐事務部同被廢權無異，大部份脫歐政策已由首相府處理，所有英國政界早已說戴德偉感到意興闌珊。//<br />\n<br />\n// 另外，會議當晚，英國傳媒亦已引述保守黨內部文件指出，文翠珊在致該黨國會議員的信件中稱，在脫歐公投期間，（上任首相甘民樂David Cameron）同意就脫歐議題上暫停內閣集體負責制，各位大臣可以自行選擇如何公開表態，而到公投後，各閣員也一直就如何脫歐各自發表意見，但隨著內閣已就脫歐方案達成協議，集體負責制將會「恢復」&mdash;&mdash;亦即是，留在內閣就必須公開支持這份脫歐文件。這就是戴德偉辭職的原因之一，亦反映文翠珊正式跟黨內不同意見人士進行政治惡鬥。//<br />\n<br />\n// 只看上述內容，也能理解為何硬脫歐派會如此憤怒。硬脫歐派要求「真脫歐」，「關稅聯盟」和「單一市場」是禁語，文翠珊自己也曾親口說過不會留在歐盟的關稅聯盟和單一市場。這份文件的確沒了這兩個詞語，但「貨品ＦＴＡ」、「聯合關稅領土」等等，其實跟「關稅聯盟」和「單一市場」分別不大。 //<br />\n<br />\n// 不過，不滿，不代表文翠珊一定立即下台。文翠珊作了抉擇，保守黨內各派又要再想一想過去一年多已不斷在盤算的問題：如果文翠珊現在倒台，所得出來的脫歐方案，會是自己（或自己的支持者）最想要的方案嗎？

RN - formerly the National Front (FN) - is accused of misusing &euro;7m of European Parliament funds intended to pay MEPs' assistants in Brussels.<br />\n<br />\nFrench prosecutors suspect that the RN used EU funds to pay staff in France.<br />\n<br />\nMs Le Pen and seven RN colleagues are members of the French parliament.<br />\n<br />\nIn a tweet (in French) on Monday Ms Le Pen said: &quot;Two

The U.K. will formally ask the EU for a post-Brexit &ldquo;association agreement&rdquo; including a &ldquo;free-trade area&rdquo; for goods, a looser arrangement for financial services, alongside a security partnership and continued membership of many EU agencies, according to a long-awaited white paper.<br />\n<br />\nConfirming plans agreed by Theresa May&rsquo;s Cabinet at a summit on Friday, which led to the resignation of Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the white paper proposes that the U.K. abide by the EU&rsquo;s common rule book for regulation and product standards for goods, to protect &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; supply chains.<br />\n<br />\nUnder the proposal, a joint EU-U.K. committee would judge whether an EU rule change applies to the association agreement, and then the U.K. parliament would have the right to decide to continue to abide by EU rules &ldquo;recognizing there could be proportionate implications&rdquo; for trade between the two if MPs decided not to.<br />\n<br />\nThe proposed relationship would require continued close cooperation with the EU, including &ldquo;regular dialogue between U.K. and EU leaders.&rdquo; The white paper acknowledges that as the arbiter of the EU&rsquo;s regulations, U.K. courts must make reference to the European Court of Justice, but stipulates that an independent arbiter should settle any disputes between the U.K. and EU.<br />\n<br />\nOn customs, the white paper confirms the U.K.&rsquo;s plan for a &ldquo;facilitated customs arrangement,&rdquo; (FCA) collecting EU tariffs at its border for goods destined for the EU market, while applying U.K. tariffs to goods destined for the U.K. market. The system will be subject to a &ldquo;phased&rdquo; implementation, with both the U.K. and EU having to make preparations, but the white paper gives no timeframe for the FCA to be up and running.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: gold;\">Policy paper: The future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union</span><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-relationship-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union?\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fpublications%2Fthe-future-relationship-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union%3F&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=dd4628c1\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-relationship-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union?</a>"},{"pid":"bc20174c6cde0056fda8c3135709f2e928f87387","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-07-13T04:58:00.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Trump: soft Brexit will 'kill' UK's chances of US trade deal<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/12/may-bids-for-trump-brexit-backing-with-vow-to-rip-up-red-tape\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2018%2Fjul%2F12%2Fmay-bids-for-trump-brexit-backing-with-vow-to-rip-up-red-tape&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=911da426\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/12/may-bids-for-trump-brexit-backing-with-vow-to-rip-up-red-tape</a><br />\n<br />\nTheresa May will come under intense pressure to secure a future trade deal with the United States as she sits down with Donald Trump just hours after he warned that her soft Brexit blueprint would &ldquo;kill&rdquo; Britain&rsquo;s chances.<br />\n<br />\nIn an extraordinary interview that threatened to undermine her new Brexit strategy, painfully thrashed out with her cabinet last week, Trump questioned whether her plans upheld the referendum result and accused her of ignoring his advice.<br />\n<br />\nAgainst a backdrop of furious protests across the country, the US president openly humiliated May by suggesting that former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who quit in opposition to her Brexit plans this week, would make a great prime minister.<br />\n<br />\nOn Thursday evening, as May told a dinner held in Trump&rsquo;s honour at Blenheim Palace that her policy would create an &ldquo;unprecedented opportunity&rdquo; for a free trade agreement, his damaging statements were revealed.<br />\n<br />\nIn the interview, which ignores all usual diplomatic conventions, Trump warned that her soft Brexit approach would scupper any hopes of a free trade agreement, a cherished prize of many Brexiters.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal.

failed bombing in their effort to push European governments to choke off Iran&rsquo;s access to everything from their airspace to cash deposits, arguing that Tehran&rsquo;s involvement in terrorist

There&rsquo;s no telling when Iran may try to foment terrorism, violence &amp; instability in one of our countries next.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nSo far, the Americans have had little luck in winning over the Europeans. They have run into resistance from allies angered by Trump&rsquo;s harsh criticism of Europe, which many fear is undermining the transatlantic relationship. European leaders are also still trying to salvage what they can of the Iran nuclear deal, which they argue was the West&rsquo;s best chance of keeping Tehran from building a nuclear arsenal.

Despite an increase in gang-related violence involving shootings and even some grenade attacks, the country&rsquo;s police chief told POLITICO there has only been a small rise in the murder rate of about 100 per year (and no, there are no zeros missing).<br />\n<br />\nMost polls currently see the Social Democrats, who won back power at the head of a leftist alliance in 2014 with 32 percent, dropping to about 24 percent.

Downing Street insisted the amendments did no such thing and chose to climb down rather than risk an embarrassing rebellion at the hands of their own backbench MPs.<br />\n<br />\nDefense Minister Guto Bebb quit May&rsquo;s government following the vote &mdash; preferring to oppose one of the Brexiteer amendments that his pro-Eurpean colleagues insisted only served to undermine the government. In doing so he became the 10th member of the government to quit since the prime minister won Cabinet agreement for her new Brexit plan just over a week ago, including former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.<br />\n<br />\nMay will face a second round of public party in-fighting Tuesday when anti-Brexit Tories will make another attempt to soften the U.K.&rsquo;s exit from the bloc, with their own proposed amendment to the trade bill. The proposal, according to the Sun, would establish a backstop to May&rsquo;s new Brexit plan forcing her to agree to join a customs union with the EU if she fails to persuade Brussels to allow Britain a free-trade area on goods by January 21, 2019 &mdash; two months from Brexit day."},{"pid":"063e259899d870ef91acbfa8aa20d674fe434aa1","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-17T05:59:10.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Guto Bebb: MP resigns as minister over Brexit vote<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-44854892\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuk-wales-politics-44854892&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=d1f8eec6\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-44854892</a><br />\n<br />\nA Welsh Conservative MP has quit as a minister so he could vote against the government on its Brexit Customs Bill.<br />\n<br />\nGuto Bebb resigned as minister for defence procurement ahead of Monday night's vote.<br />\n<br />\nMPs voted by 305 to 302 to support an amendment that critics said would undermine Theresa May's recently-announced negotiating position.<br />\n<br />\nMr Bebb, MP for Aberconwy, has been highly critical of Brexit-supporting Conservatives recently.<br />\n<br />\nHe branded Boris Johnson's resignation as foreign secretary &quot;a selfish act&quot; and attacked former Brexit Minister David Jones for criticising the prime minister's plan for future trade with the EU."},{"pid":"59650785112fee9bd4116cc5aa60efec94ae1197","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-17T10:38:10.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">EU-Japan free trade agreement defies protectionism<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/eu-japan-free-trade-agreement-defies-protectionism/a-44695274\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Feu-japan-free-trade-agreement-defies-protectionism%2Fa-44695274&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=95fe9fa2\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dw.com/en/eu-japan-free-trade-agreement-defies-protectionism/a-44695274</a><br />\n<br />\nThe European Union (EU) and Japan have signed a trade deal that promises to eliminate 99 percent of tariffs that cost businesses in the EU and Japan nearly &euro;1 billion ($1.17 billion) annually.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the European Commission, the EU-Japan &quot;Economic Partnership Agreement&quot; (EPA) is the largest trade deal ever negotiated by the EU and will create a trade zone covering 600 million people and nearly a third of global GDP.<br />\n<br />\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk in Tokyo on Tuesday to sign the EPA at the 25th EU-Japan Summit.

the assessment of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia was behind a campaign of cyberattacks intended to impact the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, reversing course from a day earlier, when he said he saw no reason why the Kremlin might have launched such an attack.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Let me begin by saying that, once again, the full faith and support for America's intelligence agencies, I have a full faith in our intelligence agencies,&quot; Trump told reporters at the top of a White House meeting on Tuesday. &quot;Let me be totally clear in saying that &mdash; and I've said this many times, I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place. Could be other people also.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe president&rsquo;s reversal &mdash; one of several he has had on the issue of Russian interference since his 2016 election victory &mdash; follows Monday&rsquo;s bilateral news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one that critics said marked a foreign policy nadir of Trump&rsquo;s first 16 months in office.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I actually went out and reviewed a clip of an answer that I gave, and I realize that there is need for some clarification. It should have been obvious, I thought it would be obvious, but I would like to clarify just in case it wasn't,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't.' The sentence should have been, &lsquo;I don't see any reason why I wouldn't&rsquo; or &lsquo;why it wouldn't be Russia.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;So just to repeat it, I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't,' and the sentence should have been &mdash; and I thought I would be maybe a little bit unclear on the transcript or unclear on the actual video,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;The sentence should have been, &lsquo;I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia.&rsquo; Sort of a double negative. So you can put that in, and I think that probably clarifies things pretty good by itself.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"065e9b599d1f0a3d98ab6aa4c93955a2d133e99a","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-18T11:21:33.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">German Cabinet declares Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria 'safe'<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/german-cabinet-declares-tunisia-morocco-algeria-safe/a-44717827\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Fgerman-cabinet-declares-tunisia-morocco-algeria-safe%2Fa-44717827&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=1461222e\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dw.com/en/german-cabinet-declares-tunisia-morocco-algeria-safe/a-44717827</a><br />\n<br />\nThe German government will put forward legislation declaring Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and Georgia &quot;safe countries of origin.&quot; The decision was reached after the weekly meeting of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet on Wednesday in Berlin.<br />\n<br />\nIf enacted, the change in the law would make it easier for Germany to turn back people from and deport them back to the countries in question, which have been frequently accused of human-rights violations.<br />\n<br />\nSeehofer said that asylum applicants from the countries concerned had a success rate of less than five percent.

After all, the place has all the trappings of countryhood. When I arrived at the airport, a customs officer in a Somaliland uniform checked my Somaliland visa, issued by the Somaliland consulate in Washington DC. At the airport, there was a Somaliland flag. During my visit, I paid Somaliland shillings to drivers of cabs with Somaliland plates who took me to the offices of ministers of the Somaliland government. <br />\n<br />\nBut, according to the US Department of State, the United Nations, the African Union and every other government on Earth, I was not in Somaliland, a poor but stable and mostly functional country on the Horn of Africa. I was in Somalia. //<br />\n<br />\n// Even among unrecognised states, Somaliland is a special case &ndash; it is both completely independent and politically entirely isolated. Unlike South Sudan before its independence, Somaliland&rsquo;s claim for statehood is based not on a redrawing of colonial borders, but an attempt to re-establish them. Unlike Taiwan, it is shackled not to a richer, more powerful country, but a poorer, weaker one. Unlike Palestine, its quest for independence is not a popular cause for activists around the world. //<br />\n<br />\n// As the names of their countries suggest, there&rsquo;s little ethnic or linguistic difference between the people of Somalia and Somaliland. The entity that today calls itself the Republic of Somaliland owes its existence to two main factors: its proximity to Yemen and its abundance of sheep. In the late 19th century, Britain (with the support of Italy) and France (with the support of Russia) were locked in a struggle for control of the Nile. As a means of both countering French influence and ensuring a regular supply of mutton for its garrison at the Yemeni port city of Aden, Britain signed a series of agreements with tribes in northern Somalia.// <br />\n<br />\n// So why has Somaliland been more successful and stable than its southern neighbour, even with virtually no assistance from the international community? The fact that is is largely populated by only one clan has helped it avoid tribal conflicts, unlike some other countries in the region. Most Somalilanders also point to the role of clan elders. In addition to a president and a traditional elected parliament, Somaliland has an unelected upper house of elders, somewhat similar to Britain&rsquo;s House of Lords, which has a consultative role on certain legislation and is entrusted with settling disputes between the country&rsquo;s subclans. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the elders who really made this peace,&rdquo; Mohamed Omar Hagi, a UK-based Somali activist, told me.//<br />\n<br />\n// he argument against Somaliland&rsquo;s independence rests largely on factors beyond the country&rsquo;s control. Somaliland officials are used to hearing that if their independence were recognised, it would set off a domino effect for nationalist movements, destabilising the continent. If Somaliland were independent, what would stop other regions from trying the same thing?//"},{"pid":"3799d9d3e0d02ef805f1629495e44e4b86ddb32a","tid":659239,"uid":26752,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"9d3c9485730bfc422ec09db902ac07ede50a5bf1","tid":659239,"uid":42921,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-07-20T01:12:04.000Z","msg":"trump仔日日屌歐盟，幫俄仔講好說話，中國還擊就粒聲唔出，琴日仲出口術屌聯儲局，日日要白宮幫佢執屎<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-21T03:12:55.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/fifa/wonder2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/fifa/wonder2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n2月<br />\n中国对美国进口高粱展开双反调查，贸易争端升级<br />\n<br />\n5月<br />\n中国终止对美国进口高粱的反倾销调查<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> 中国商务部表示，在今年2月启动调查后，已收到大量下游用户的反映：反倾销关税可能会影响他们的生活成本。</span><br />\n<br />\n算唔算支那反擊<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://reut.rs/2uz0Olo\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Freut.rs%2F2uz0Olo&d=wapzj4paykHaBJyKCXJ%2FoaNGKT0mDZcTD8WJHRevFdc%3D&h=bb61d469\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://reut.rs/2uz0Olo</a><br />\n算唔算粒聲唔出"},{"pid":"013b47abde002561627348d589abcd90bedaf66e","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-21T05:47:09.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Facebook investigates data firm Crimson Hexagon<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://lihkg.com/thread/659239/page/28\" target=\"_blank\">https://lihkg.com/thread/659239/page/28</a><br />\n<br />\nFacebook has suspended a US-based analytics firm while it investigates concerns about the collection and sharing of user data.<br />\n<br />\nCrimson Hexagon, based in Boston, describes itself as offering &ldquo;consumer insights&rdquo; and has contracts with government agencies around the world.<br />\n<br />\nFacebook said it was looking into whether some of these deals were in violation of its policies on surveillance.<br />\n<br />\nThe network said it had not found any evidence so far that data had been improperly obtained.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Crimson Hexagon has &quot;contracts to analyse public Facebook data for clients including a Russian nonprofit with ties to the Kremlin and multiple US government agencies&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nCrimson Hexagon works with a data set that includes, according to its own website, more than one trillion social media posts take from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and others.

Johnson&rsquo;s remarks in response to Denmark&rsquo;s introduction of a ban of burqas in public places.<br />\n<br />\nSidestepping the question of whether the former foreign secretary was Islamophobic, May said: &ldquo;I have said it&rsquo;s very clear that anybody who is talking about this needs to think very carefully about the language that they use and the impact that language has had on people, and it is clear that the language that Boris used has offended people.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"300be789035221917a33dcce9dfd22a9a25ce43f","tid":659239,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-08-08T03:20:22.000Z","msg":"<strong><span

Other world powers such as Japan and the U.S. remain skeptical about its stated aims and even more worried about unspoken ones, especially those hinting at military expansion. To assess the reality of Belt and Road from the ground up, Bloomberg Markets deployed a team of reporters to five cities on three continents at the forefront of China&rsquo;s grand plan.<br />\n<br />\nWhat emerges is a picture of mostly poor nations&mdash;laggards during the past half-century of global growth&mdash;that jumped at the promise of Chinese-financed projects they hoped would help them catch up. And yet as some high-profile ones falter and the cost of their Chinese funding rises, would-be beneficiaries from Hambantota, Sri Lanka, to Piraeus, Greece, are questioning the long-term price. In Malaysia, one of the biggest recipients of Chinese investment in Southeast Asia, newly installed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is pushing back. Expressing concerns about loan conditions and the use of Chinese labor that limit benefits to the local economy, he&rsquo;s put billions of dollars of Chinese-&shy;funded rail and pipeline projects on hold.<br />\n<br />\nBelt and Road is very much about politics at home, too. With the government and state-owned enterprises investing vast sums outside China, Xi is encouraging Chinese companies to channel their spending into domestic projects that will directly benefit the economy and, incidentally, the popularity of his regime.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Economic clout is diplomacy by other means. It&rsquo;s not for today.
