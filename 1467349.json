Solid evidence has indicated that the Hong Kong Police Force has violated human rights of protestors, while the government refuses to address any opposing voice from the general public. I sincerely ask for your help and call for attention from the international society.<br />\n<br />\n\tThe commonwealth has long been a well-known voice in the world, striving for democracy and human rights in its member countries; the general public of Hong Kong are well aware of it and appreciate the hard work you have done along the way. <br />\n<br />\n\tIn the past few months, Hong Kong citizens have stepped out and initiated multiple protests to against the Extradition Bill proposed by the Hong Kong Government, which allows legal arrangements in criminal transfer, notably with the Chinese Government. On the 16th of June, 2 million citizens have joined the protest, which accounts for two-sevenths of Hong Kong&rsquo;s population.<br />\n<br />\n\tIn light of the protest activities, the Hong Kong Government, still, ignored the opposing opinions and refused to abandon the Extradition Bill, they have just suspended the job. On the other hand, the Hong Kong Police Force has unlawfully abused unnecessary crowd control gear, such as firing expired tear gas at the indoor environment, shoot protestor within 1-meter proximity, allowing gangster to unconditionally attack protestors, shooting bullets to protestors&rsquo; head, to name but a few.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n\tRegarding the unethical and unlawful law enforcement, many urge the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry to investigate any possible power abuse and misconduct was involved during law enforcement. However, the Hong Kong SAR Government refuted such suggestion and continued to ignore the request from the protestors. The people of Hong Kong are running out of options but to seek more help abroad. I hope The Commonwealth can offer help in any kind regarding this issue to condemn the brutality of the Hong Kong Police Force and urge the Hong Kong SAR Government to make changes for this city.<br />\n<br />\nI am looking forward to your favorable reply, Your aid is crucial in shaping Hong Kong into a place with&nbsp;true democracy, justice and without violent extremism.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nYours Sincerely,<br />\nXXX<br />\na Hong Kong citizen"},{"pid":"5a41ffb7e22f8681e028a9bc7dea8dd478995f32","tid":1467349,"uid":216789,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:15:19.000Z","msg":"<strong>慎防黑惡勢力蔓延禍港，提防本地非法操縱妓女賣淫集團</strong><br />\n<br />\n鑒於近日有無辜香港市民慘遭黑勢力人仕襲擊，現懇切呼籲各香港市民不論男女，請慎防本地非法操縱妓女賣淫集團，保障自身安全，萬事小心，<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">切忌助長黑惡勢力氣焰</span></strong>"},{"pid":"29a09e13d4af79eef94a35c50a1f3ed6984490da","tid":1467349,"uid":262389,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:16:27.000Z","msg":"[緊急分析]法！不！責！眾！<br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1456781\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1456781</a>"},{"pid":"958f6db6d7b339037bf4a057ac0ea141cf6a6ebb","tid":1467349,"uid":76864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:20:46.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"6e1519bb48b8d8c217d82cde1b425b041ac68304","tid":1467349,"uid":76864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:25:15.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"37106ba66a427edc4da68ee311ff14402a6145cb","tid":1467349,"uid":76864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:25:28.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"b078eeeb02953988d756270bc9cbfd603e130692","tid":1467349,"uid":171929,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:56:52.000Z","msg":"推！<br />\n<br />\n話哂香港以前都係英聯邦嘅一分子！"},{"pid":"d4a8a95bc43eae28abab74e18ad79f88f59db286","tid":1467349,"uid":171929,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:57:51.000Z","msg":"send封email都唔係好難姐 ：）<br />\n<br />\n大家幫幫手啦！"},{"pid":"2459810d3eb091a147956dc749971ed2692fab32","tid":1467349,"uid":165649,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-13T17:58:15.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
