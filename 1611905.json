My friend Keita has opened a gym. So far it's been a great success. The excellent quality gym and shower equipment is a crucial factor in the success of his gym. Of course customer service also plays a key role in the company's success. He asked if I could find a good manager for him. I said &quot;I can't make any promises but I'll see what I can do&quot; My friend Tomiko has an interview for a marketing director position in his company. Keita laid particular stress on the need for leadership qualities. He also stressed clear communication skill is a decisive factor in the outcome of the interview. The interview stresses her out. I said &quot;don't stress over it. Just out your mind at ease&quot; My brother too said &quot;try not to stress too much about it. Set your mind at ease.&quot; My girlfriend said too &quot;Rest easy. Don't stress yourself too much. Set your mind at rest&quot; She quit her previous job because her colleague always bullied her and the salary was low. I said &quot;I don't blame you for wanting to leave&quot; Last week we had supper at her.place.Her elder brother got japanese homework to do. He said &quot;I've got to do part A but I haven't got to do part b&quot; He soaks up bee vocabularies and patterns very quickly. In the classes he soaks up everything the teacher says. When &quot;fukushima&quot; is a japanese word you should stress the second third and last syllables. But when it's an english word the stress is on the third syllable. When he reads a novel he's like a sponge and soaks up the story. If he encounters a computer problem he'll find jason who' an expert and will soak up the advice he offers. His younger brother has a piccolo exam next week. He said &quot;after this exam I'll do eight eight next year or better still ill directly take the diploma exam&quot; After chatting with him for a while in his room I said &quot;I'd better leave you to get on with your practice&quot;My brother said &quot;I had better leave you to practise your exam pieces.&quot;My girlfriend said &quot;I'll leave you to get on with it&quot; His eldest brother went to meditate in his room after supper so I left him to himself. Some milk spilt down the walm onto the floor so Tomiko soaked it up with a dishcloth.His.sister booked a massage session. She asked &quot;had I better leave my wallet on the nightstand?&quot; I said &quot;you'd better not leave it on the bedside table during your session as someone might steal it&quot; My brother said &quot;hadn't you better leave it in your locker so that its safe?&quot; Recently Keita shouted at his sister and called her a liar due to a misunderstanding. I said &quot;I can't believe you would say that to her&quot; my brother said &quot;I can't believe you said that&quot; Keita will be giving a birthday party at his home tomorrow but alas I can't attend as I got work. When he invited me at first I said &quot;I'll have to see&quot; Happy birthday Keita! I'm sure your friends will join me in wishing you a very happy birthday. Last year he got a massage chair for my birthday.i remember I said &quot;I can't believe you got me a massage chair&quot;There's pageant of which thr final round will take place next month. I would think Aiko seems very likely to enter thr final round."},{"pid":"68960eb3cc956b6dd9a11ea7c0d75e7363e51a7c","tid":1611905,"uid":64850,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T09:49:49.000Z","msg":"Goji?<br />\n<br />\n我有同事去開Goji 呢間就多係港島<br />\n<br />\n我自己就Anytime Fitness"},{"pid":"9eab2cb032e359c92db79ff4f092ada1c0b3f7a9","tid":1611905,"uid":343273,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"1f1e301ea5139432666a00ddb16e0f584552ed79","tid":1611905,"uid":50511,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-10-02T05:40:46.000Z","msg":"想問下 銅鑼灣 灣仔 有咩gym room正正常常<br />\n唔係昆錢果啲"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-31T04:55:32.000Z","msg":"巴打有興趣可以聯絡我<br />\n<br />\nFitness first sales <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://t.me/hiiihiii162739\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fhiiihiii162739&d=9ZkxwAQN0Q6nkyzE8ymhdBBMzzOW1qmypsfK5hxWA9U%3D&h=10df30b0\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://t.me/hiiihiii162739</a>"}]}
