You could never recreate the envelope,&rdquo; he said. So they had to be collected from real voters.<br />\n<br />\nHe would have his operatives fan out, going house to house, convincing voters to let them mail completed ballots on their behalf as a public service. The fraudster and his minions would then take the sealed envelopes home and hold them over boiling water.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;You have to steam it to loosen the glue,&rdquo; said the insider.<br />\n<br />\nHe then would remove the real ballot, place the counterfeit ballot inside the signed certificate, and reseal the envelope.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Five minutes per ballot tops,&rdquo; said the insider.<br />\n<br />\nNursing homes <br />\n<br />\nHitting up assisted-living facilities and &ldquo;helping&rdquo; the elderly fill out their absentee ballots was a gold mine of votes, the insider said.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;There are nursing homes where the nurse is actually a paid operative. And they go room by room by room to these old people who still want to feel like they&rsquo;re relevant,&rdquo; said the whistleblower. &ldquo;[They] literally fill it out for them.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nInside jobs<br />\n<br />\nThe tipster said sometimes postal employees are in on the scam.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;You have a postman who is a rabid anti-Trump guy and he&rsquo;s working in Bedminster or some Republican stronghold &hellip; He can take those [filled-out] ballots, and knowing 95% are going to a Republican, he can just throw those in the garbage.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBribing voters <br />\n<br />\nThe tipster said New Jersey homeless shelters offered a nearly inexhaustible pool of reliable &mdash; buyable &mdash; voters.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;They get to register where they live in and they go to the polls and vote,&rdquo; he said, laughing at the roughly $174 per vote Mike Bloomberg spent to win his third mayoral term. He said he could have delivered the same result at a 70 percent discount &mdash; like when Frank &ldquo;Pupie&rdquo; Raia, a real estate developer and Hoboken nabob, was convicted last year on federal charges for paying low-income residents 50 bucks a pop to vote how he wanted during a 2013 municipal election."},{"pid":"1cafe87538990d70e2545666e9b0f4b3aa606539","tid":2184666,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-01T17:05:47.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/prageru/status/1299838488712421379?s=21\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fprageru%2Fstatus%2F1299838488712421379%3Fs%3D21&d=H6IDb39AroI58YjM1eqeYb9EqtgOipuK5hw8%2B6jdv%2Bo%3D&h=35c2cffb\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fprageru%2Fstatus%2F1299838488712421379%3Fs%3D21&h=2c581f40\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/prageru/status/1299838488712421379?s=21</a>"},{"pid":"656f1d564dc47fc87eb5a351ad93bb9f78c7c3ec","tid":2184666,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-01T17:12:13.000Z","msg":"Bloomberg已經吹風<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realcandaceo/status/1300779102643912705?s=21\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frealcandaceo%2Fstatus%2F1300779102643912705%3Fs%3D21&d=H6IDb39AroI58YjM1eqeYb9EqtgOipuK5hw8%2B6jdv%2Bo%3D&h=73d5ed1a\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frealcandaceo%2Fstatus%2F1300779102643912705%3Fs%3D21&h=de44dd37\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/realcandaceo/status/1300779102643912705?s=21</a>"},{"pid":"ecd2473ee32f2d13712a6e7f2b2a4f4c35ee9172","tid":2184666,"uid":1726,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-01T17:41:53.000Z","msg":"侵贏之後BLM唔認數屈造假 正式開始文化大革命<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/scare.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b68043b8f0527b7f5c7b5cab827f98b0ac01f36d","tid":2184666,"uid":109780,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-01T17:47:42.000Z","msg":"大豆侵根本唔會贏，洗撚做假咩<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/10.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d0e31e7127613d30b98a74015bee24537bc7339d","tid":2184666,"uid":206080,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-01T18:53:07.000Z","msg":"拜登輕鬆贏啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/lightbulb.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/lightbulb.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/lightbulb.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5e5f2ff2070f085cb4865c66716c87b166bad63e","tid":2184666,"uid":95138,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-01T21:18:55.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"}]}
