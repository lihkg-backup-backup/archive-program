I love that it was the most economically free society in modern times (number #1 in economic freedom from 1995 when ranking starts to 2019), that it was build by immigrants from nothing to most developed and richest city in the world. I love that it's a city-state, how civilized it is, that is a monument of humanity's potential, that it became trading hub for global capitalism, that firms (and specialists) from all over the world migrated there, that it has highest IQ population and one of the lowest crime rate, that it maintained its XIX-century freedoms when West lost them, that libertarians from all over the world was always using this city as their guiding star, ideal to strive for, an example to follow, how Milton Friedman flew there to show Americans how free-market looks like, how this city was showing what humanity is capable of when left relatively free to pursue happiness and build prosperity. I love how it accomplished american ideals better than US. I love how lively and changing it was, how it was a mix of what best western and eastern worlds had to offer. How people from all nations, races, religions and cultures could live there their &quot;Hong Kong dream&quot;, how they could live there more freely than anywhere else on Earth...<br />\n<br />\nBut this is not what I love in Hong Kong the most. The most I love its people, how they care about freedom, how they're the last society on Earth in which you can see this individualistic spirit, this passion for liberty, which you cannot experience that strongly anywhere else, how Hongkongers are culturally mixed of West and East, how they are civilized, cosmopolitan, based, open-minded, rational, kind to each other and to those who share their values, how much unity you can feel and observe in them, true unity built and shared on true values and voluntary cooperation, something which cannot be faked or artificially created by the coercion of the state, how many and how much Hongkongers are authentic, that in their eyes you can see and from their beings you can feel that they have souls, that they are real people, and not dead-zombies like most of humanity, that you can enter into true relations with them and have interactions as with independent human beings and not state-controlled robots. I love how they are independent minded and self-reliant, how they organize voluntarily and bottom-up when needed, how they're not &quot;waiting for government to do sth&quot; like other societies, but just build, create, organize and do themselves, like Americans in XIX-century. I love how their men are masculine, brave and not domesticated slaves, and how their women are feminine, kind and lovely, which we've lost in the West. And the most important thing - I love how they Care, with capital C, for freedom, for betterment of their lives, for their society, for their city, for their values, for their loved ones, for everything, how good-hearted they are..."},{"pid":"a74fe1f4915663b50ded61e229960f6a069cb401","tid":2129697,"uid":126675,"like":12,"dislike":0,"score":12,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-28T19:01:23.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/116340587_3060507477390913_2518774157821280341_o.jpg?_nc_cat=108&amp;_nc_sid=730e14&amp;_nc_ohc=-lGKa51TDWAAX-jrAwd&amp;_nc_oc=AQn3BYECWqBqI5s4F8ZiribbQgFWa08k8XAANT0C_tHA1ShF79vBVnGVjVzIhUop7g5au6yMMp9Al9tR2hYDWKzG&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-lht6-1.xx&amp;oh=e1d07a5240c42f9e096b0a2f3a32f936&amp;oe=5F47DCCD\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fv%2Ft1.0-9%2F116340587_3060507477390913_2518774157821280341_o.jpg%3F_nc_cat%3D108%26_nc_sid%3D730e14%26_nc_ohc%3D-lGKa51TDWAAX-jrAwd%26_nc_oc%3DAQn3BYECWqBqI5s4F8ZiribbQgFWa08k8XAANT0C_tHA1ShF79vBVnGVjVzIhUop7g5au6yMMp9Al9tR2hYDWKzG%26_nc_ht%3Dscontent-lht6-1.xx%26oh%3De1d07a5240c42f9e096b0a2f3a32f936%26oe%3D5F47DCCD&h=7998d367&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nI love how this country and its society is the best that humanity accomplished and has to offer.<br />\n<br />\nI'm really, really proud of you.
