He's facing six counts of securities fraud and six counts of wire fraud.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;This scheme to defraud Company-1 and its shareholders allowed Levoff to realize profits of approximately $227,000 on certain trades and to avoid losses of approximately $377,000 on others,&quot; according to the press release.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIt continued: &quot;When Levoff discovered that Company-1 had posted strong revenue and net profit for a given financial quarter, he purchased large quantities of stock, which he later sold for a profit once the market reacted to the news.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nLevoff was one of Apple's top lawyers. He started at Apple in 2008 and was a senior director of corporate law from 2013 until 2018, according to the indictment. The trades mentioned in the indictment occurred between 2011 and 2016.<br />\n<br />\nOne of his responsibilities at Apple was making sure that Apple employees didn't do any insider trading. &quot;Levoff's responsibilities included ensuring compliance with Company-1's Insider Trading Policy,&quot; according to the indictment.<br />\n<br />\nThe indictment alleges that Levoff traded stock during a &quot;blackout&quot; period, when employees can't buy or sell stock, and that he informed Apple employees about the blackout period during the same time frame he was trading Apple stock.<br />\n<br />\nThe SEC previously charged Levoff in February in a civil case. Thursday's indictment is criminal, and each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison in addition to fines.<br />\n<br />\nApple declined to comment.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;After being contacted by authorities last summer we conducted a thorough investigation with the help of outside legal experts, which resulted in termination,&quot; Apple said about the case in February.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;We look forward to vigorously defending Mr. Levoff with respect to these allegations,&quot; Kevin Marino, Levoff's lawyer, told CNBC.<br />\n<br />\nCNBC's Jim Forkin contributed to this story.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/apple-lawyer-indicted-for-insider-trading.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2019%2F10%2F24%2Fapple-lawyer-indicted-for-insider-trading.html&d=r5q0VKZH5TKX5M4XK8oFTf56hpy2SSQtx6ElJ%2BvIbMI%3D&h=9265c89a\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/apple-lawyer-indicted-for-insider-trading.html</a><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"aad643a90017d8e46b019b913b62e427613fd9ed","tid":1674217,"uid":172638,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-25T06:01:56.000Z","msg":"提大家今個星期六日有咩活動 <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>星期六 10 &middot; 26 醫護抗暴 - 醫療專職集會</strong></span><br />\n- 18:00 遮打花園 [已獲不反對通知書]<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>星期日 10 &middot; 27 <br />\n追究警暴 守護民眾記者 守護穆斯林</strong></span><br />\n- 15:00 尖沙咀梳士巴利道公園<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>星期日 10 &middot; 27 自由之鶴追悼會</strong></span><br />\n- 16:00 - 20:00 觀塘海濱公園"},{"pid":"546add54eed9652a040595b59b2b3638592ac836","tid":1674217,"uid":41818,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-25T07:27:10.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ec910ef5c4409c970965bdfa9386461a56686688","tid":1674217,"uid":61954,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-25T07:38:28.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"3a88d85d2aad71d6e854351a6a8965223695e356","tid":1674217,"uid":52215,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-25T07:50:25.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5a2240dc916c4924a74c93ef6ae71d282979e80b","tid":1674217,"uid":159448,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-25T08:01:15.000Z","msg":"香港大把快啲叫證監做野 次次未有消息就升定先正仆街<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"88ce4eb2b00d87eddb8cf61376be0e0c51a7ef99","tid":1674217,"uid":89046,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"5a2240dc916c4924a74c93ef6ae71d282979e80b","tid":1674217,"uid":159448,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-25T08:01:15.000Z","msg":"香港大把快啲叫證監做野 次次未有消息就升定先正仆街<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-26T01:50:57.000Z","msg":"想報串又冇證據 都唔知可以點做<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"9d779890c9368629ab47e949115af811927b3277","tid":1674217,"uid":234961,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-26T01:54:25.000Z","msg":"借位<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n[堅行動post][求三連]三分鐘Twitter 戰線傳送門 10月26號<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1675453\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1675453</a>"},{"pid":"b0299a5497e7ced122de9d0f3c8e79d6cf10f583","tid":1674217,"uid":89046,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-27T00:02:22.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"2f0d236e08af1ddcec34541954fef37ee0228780","tid":1674217,"uid":197640,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-27T00:35:57.000Z","msg":"Gay cook奶共，蘋果實比美國國會攪<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/clap.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/clap.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/clap.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
