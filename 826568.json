This must surely be one of New Zealand's longest and best-resourced burglary inquiries.&quot;<br />\n<strong><br />\nFormer police officer Tim McKinnell said the scope and duration of the investigation was &quot;quite extraordinary&quot; for a low-value domestic burglary investigation.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>&quot;The acknowledgement that Interpol is involved also points to something rather significant going on behind the scenes,&quot; he said.</strong><br />\n<br />\n.....The developments raise the prospects of diplomatic clash with China after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in February if Brady's complaints about being targeted for her work were borne out her government would &quot;be taking stock and taking action&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nThe Prime Minister was more reserved yesterday, with a spokesperson for her office saying: &quot;It would not be appropriate for her to comment on an active police investigation.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nQuestions sent to the embassy for the People's Republic of China in Wellington about the case went unanswered yesterday.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">The February break-in at Brady's home saw a range of electronic and data storage devices taken, while a jar left in the open filled with hundreds of dollars was ignored.<br />\n<br />\nBrady said an old and broken laptop - used to write her major expose on China's activities in New Zealand last year - was taken, while another device in the same room was left alone.</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Brady said police told her the strange selection of loot, and the &quot;conspicuous mess&quot; left - including messed-up bedding - was highly unusual.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>She also said universities she had visited in China had been intimidated by officials from the Chinese Ministry of State Security about hosting her, and some were made aware of Beijing's displeasure about her statements about the break-ins to the Australian parliamentary committee investigating Chinese influence in that country.</strong><br />\n<br />\nRhys Ball, a former NZSIS officer and now lecturer in security studies at Massey University, said there was one actor with a clear interest in Brady's research.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The state we're talking about is the PRC,&quot; he said.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The Chinese have had an understated intelligence presence in New Zealand for some time. I've been out of the business for a while, but I'd be very surprised if it's not still happening.&quot;"},{"pid":"6164c8d603a3222fa21e6568e200991b57de2874","tid":826568,"uid":48083,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-18T10:20:08.000Z","msg":"Brady, a well-regarded Mandarin-speaking expert on China's foreign policy and Polar politics, has seen her international profile skyrocket over the past year.<br />\n<br />\nIn September she published a widely-cited paper titled &quot;Magic Weapons: China's political influence activities under Xi Jinping&quot;, resulting in invitations to speak in Australia, Canada, the UK, the US, Japan, Denmark and Germany.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/for_website_magicweaponsanne-mariesbradyseptember2017.pdf\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wilsoncenter.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Ffor_website_magicweaponsanne-mariesbradyseptember2017.pdf&d=KStb7oAJy0v30uX54xUqcleK4D04he4k8uKHxpzC8zE%3D&h=0ecaf223\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/for_website_magicweaponsanne-mariesbradyseptember2017.pdf</a><br />\n<br />\n...That paper detailed what she claimed was a nexus of political donations, and appointments of prominent New Zealanders to boards, linked to a broad political influence campaign led by the government of China with the aim of shaping New Zealand policy.<br />\nEarlier this year she visited Washington DC to present discuss her research with think tanks and the US Navy War College.
