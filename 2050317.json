Those who are truly concerned about addressing the tragic loss of black lives should look for proactive measures that could reduce the incidence of violence between police and civilians. I witnessed one example several decades ago when I worked with the National Black Police Association, <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>which called for a policy that would require a police officer to restrain or arrest a fellow officer if he witnesses him using undue force. Loyalty and commitment to the rule of law should prevail over loyalty to fellow officers.</strong></span> If the officers who were involved in the killing of Floyd had come upon three civilians engaged in an assault, they would have made arrests; the same should have applied to their fellow policeman.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Law-enforcement officers should be held to a higher standard because they carry the authority of the state. When they abuse that standard and engage in actions that result in the needless loss of life, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n先不論佢地係暴民定示威者<br />\n法律&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;忠誠(冗偽)<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/riots-invite-crime-not-justice-11590944072?cx_testId=3&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_4&amp;cx_artPos=4#cxrecs_s\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Friots-invite-crime-not-justice-11590944072%3Fcx_testId%3D3%26cx_testVariant%3Dcx_4%26cx_artPos%3D4%23cxrecs_s&d=Fi4Me5dMHeyo7M%2BwlVraYyMX%2BuEjOoKUanh%2Bi4Xf2cM%3D&h=5cef42a1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/riots-invite-crime-not-justice-11590944072?cx_testId=3&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_4&amp;cx_artPos=4#cxrecs_s</a>"},{"pid":"e8a8b8c117afe541d6ac9907d6445321732f36a1","tid":2050317,"uid":132587,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-04T04:59:59.000Z","msg":"香港黑警: 互相包庇"},{"pid":"6c298a13c0c0a0133b1ec497aa04c6f54d3587e1","tid":2050317,"uid":51271,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"e8a8b8c117afe541d6ac9907d6445321732f36a1","tid":2050317,"uid":132587,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-04T04:59:59.000Z","msg":"香港黑警: 互相包庇"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-04T05:11:33.000Z","msg":"香港：Popo is the law"},{"pid":"8ea83a70d24754d7b7827f3a7f5dfa9094139c18","tid":2050317,"uid":155818,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-04T05:13:47.000Z","msg":"打擊士氣<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/mock.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"30fcba20fa20830c9203278d61f09b99dbcfdcb0","tid":2050317,"uid":340796,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"6c298a13c0c0a0133b1ec497aa04c6f54d3587e1","tid":2050317,"uid":51271,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"e8a8b8c117afe541d6ac9907d6445321732f36a1","tid":2050317,"uid":132587,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-04T04:59:59.000Z","msg":"香港黑警: 互相包庇"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-04T05:11:33.000Z","msg":"香港：Popo is the law"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-04T05:26:32.000Z","msg":"正解<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
