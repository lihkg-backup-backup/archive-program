Wonder Woman #750 followed in the footsteps of DC's previous giant-sized 80th anniversary issues Action Comics #1000 and Detective Comics #1000 and led all other comics in the month in both unit and dollar sales.<br />\n<br />\nWonder Woman was historically a middling-seller for DC, with only George P&eacute;rez's 1986 relaunch, seen at right, coming close to leading the market. (It placed eighth.) Its anniversary issue didn't approach the stratospheric sales levels of Action and Detective, but its 167,377 North American copies were enough to more than double the dollar sales of any other item in January."},{"pid":"75f6766179e734d03d58848f6f937fc5831d2dcf","tid":1885977,"uid":34123,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-18T16:59:21.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"921cb5c076ccd175385dbf02777c00d8e393c2a9","tid":1885977,"uid":34123,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-18T17:00:18.000Z","msg":"完美miss咗堆variant"},{"pid":"d2600b6bcf34884f48c96cd9eff32034f28e8054","tid":1885977,"uid":121471,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-19T16:05:01.000Z","msg":"DC聊天室"},{"pid":"6de55b5f071ab96d29a03f54968fb942e73732e0","tid":1885977,"uid":121471,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-02-20T02:48:31.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-catwoman-tom-king-selina-kyle-pregnancy/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbr.com%2Fbatman-catwoman-tom-king-selina-kyle-pregnancy%2F&d=aTFRN7Q3AKWWv%2B0RVwuGmgweZXAU%2BhIfMqCJmwSRnXM%3D&h=288d9286\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cbr.com/batman-catwoman-tom-king-selina-kyle-pregnancy/</a><br />\nBatman與Catwoman結婚後將會有喜(Helena?)<br />\n<img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/batman-catwoman-pregnancy.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=450&amp;h=344&amp;dpr=1.5\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic1.cbrimages.com%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F02%2Fbatman-catwoman-pregnancy.jpg%3Fq%3D50%26fit%3Dcrop%26w%3D450%26h%3D344%26dpr%3D1.5&h=ebe20e69&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"74845dbacbaabe4b6fbddf290e4af0c959988a65","tid":1885977,"uid":121471,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-02-22T01:46:55.000Z","msg":"掌舵DC十多年既Dan Didio今日終於收皮！<br />\n據悉世界各地既dc fans得知消息後都大開香檳慶祝<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bleedingcool.com/2020/02/21/scoop-dan-didio-no-longer-publisher-of-dc-comics/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bleedingcool.com%2F2020%2F02%2F21%2Fscoop-dan-didio-no-longer-publisher-of-dc-comics%2F&d=aTFRN7Q3AKWWv%2B0RVwuGmgweZXAU%2BhIfMqCJmwSRnXM%3D&h=2a92bbb1\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bleedingcool.com/2020/02/21/scoop-dan-didio-no-longer-publisher-of-dc-comics/</a><br />\nWhether he was quit, fired, or pushed out, we don't yet know.
