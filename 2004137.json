Eight were Singaporeans or permanent residents, four were work pass holders, and another 15 were migrant workers not living in dormitories.<br />\n<br />\nCases among Singaporeans, PRs and pass holders have dropped to an average of 10 a day in the past week from 17 two weeks ago.<br />\n<br />\nThe average daily number of such unlinked cases has also fallen to five from 10 in the same period.<br />\n<br />\nAs of Tuesday, 1,513 patients in Singapore have fully recovered from the virus and been discharged.<br />\n<br />\nEighteen have died from Covid-19 complications and six who tested positive have died from other causes.<br />\n<br />\nGlobally, the outbreak, which began in December last year, has infected more than 3.6 million people. Some 257,000 patients have died.<br />\n<br />\nThe United States is the worst affected country in the world with more than 1.2 million cases and 71,000 deaths from Covid-19 as of Wednesday.<br
