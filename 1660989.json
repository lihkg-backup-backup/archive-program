This lady asked for its message to be spread (all hand-written!).<br />\n<br />\nTyped up as below, reassuring young people of Hong Kong that there is always a way and Hong Kong mums love them<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> And that we need to vote<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />\n<br />\nSome young ppl may ask, &ldquo;We've done everything, what else could we do? We don't have anywhere else to go!&rdquo; <br />\nBut there is always a way. There must be. Hong Kong has so many talented youths, brimming w/courage &amp; ideas. All young ppl of Hong Kong, pls cherish life &amp; keep safe.<br />\nWhile Carrie Lam may set her evil traps, we Hongkongers should also build our own flight-and-fight routes:<br />\n<br />\n1. Save #Hongkong w/ votes, not w/ masks. <br />\nAll HK youths pls focus your energies on planning &amp; preparing for the upcoming District Council elections in 18 districts, such as design and promo etc.<br />\n<br />\n2. Based on experience, no matter it was DistCo or LegCo elections, CCP always uses dirty tricks like terror attack, torture, bribery, disqualification, etc., to force Democratic candidates to withdraw and their voters to retreat. <br />\nTheir evil tool is fear and their goal is total power. We must find ways to counter fear.<br />\n<br />\n3. To guard against such CCP dirty tricks, apart from having our own civilian press conferences, we must mobilise all 18 districts' youths &amp; all professionals to establish our own civilian defence corps, to undergo rapid training &amp; take shifts to protect candidates &amp; voters.<br />\n<br />\n4. This would help ensure free &amp; fair elections within both the spirit &amp; letter of law. We can kick out pro-regime candidates w/ our votes, esp when Carrie Lam shows us her so-called dialogue is just an evil trick to help introduce facemask ban.<br />\n<br />\n5. CUHK student Sonia Ng is so brave. She has inspired all Hongkongers, a real HK sweetheart.<br />\nLet God's love embrace you, our civilian defence corp protect you, our millions of Hong Kong mothers love you. <br />\nNo one could be allowed to hurt you anymore. For those who did, karma's coming!<br />\n<br />\n(To be continued)"},{"pid":"a06b3f3975fdbade811e03cd9b8f5554c47616dd","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T00:29:36.000Z","msg":"6. These past months have shown us that Carrie Lam, pro-CCP party &amp; Hk police are all untrustworthy. <br />\nThey take high salaries from taxpayers but bite the hands that feed them &amp; betray Hongkongers - even to the evil extent of destroying our next generation &amp; the future of all HK youths. <br />\nThese are all allegedly because of a murderer suspect, CarrieLam. Have you no shame in facing your ancestors?<br />\n<br />\n7. Our youths fight with courage &amp; self-discipline to not get arrested, turning tough pressure into motivation to resist. <br />\nAll Hongkongers please stand united. Knowing that 2 million of us have no other recourse, we take decisive actions with a steely determination. Our young ppl are not monsters, but victims of Carrie Lam. <br />\nDestruction is in fact the precursor of proper construction.<br />\n<br />\n8. CarrieLam uses Xi's evil powers to shoot Hongkongers. Our streets are full of handsome men &amp; beautiful women, all highly-educated, with lofty ideas backed by immense courage. <br />\nOur youths are of such high-calibre! Yet they're attacked by knife/ bat-wielding middle-aged fools!So who's the ugly one? <br />\nIf directors were to turn our 2019 Hong Kong protests into a film, it'd be a Blockbuster one.<br />\nIn all professions, if staff/ student get arrested/ hurt, pls protect them as a mother hen would for its chicks. The real rioters are Lam's henchmen.<br />\n<br />\n8. I beseech all frontline #Hkpolice, pls have mercy &amp; use minimum force when making arrests, do not use your baton to bash ppl, esp their heads. <br />\nHope all police realise protesters are fellow brothers &amp; sisters; that they are fighting for the rights of your next generation, too.<br />\nPls pause &amp; reflect on how your own police spokesmen are busy trying to emigrate overseas, why? Why would you commit such energies into enforcing an evil law &amp; abuse your powers to the max? <br />\nThis is really not worth it, betraying your humanity as well as your next generation&rsquo;s.<br />\n<br />\n9. I sincerely hope that everyone can spread this message through WhatsApp, LIHKG, Facebook, telegram, Instagram and the Lennon Walls in all 18 districts. Save Hong Kong!<br />\n<br />\n&mdash;&mdash; END &mdash;&mdash;"},{"pid":"d68d606505f0a58577704ad88a2e93298201e183","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T00:30:31.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/j7ZvwjE.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2Fj7ZvwjE.jpg&h=0d207992&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nThis was the original handwritten note she passed to the youngsters..."},{"pid":"c5d916876c3e3089fa02cafaf93902ae5209bf4e","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T00:31:18.000Z","msg":"Btw 1020<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a12d62d960079111fbf467ab4c7738edd0cc58de","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T00:49:08.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"c984f4212a5e422c86144854201e717ca621eb69","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T00:55:04.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"b2af1e10eea4ea212567702d2528ee16988bdcb1","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T01:09:24.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"64cebb9e0eacdca9be915feaba4e095937dc5571","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T05:09:33.000Z","msg":"Pushhhh"},{"pid":"35189e62d296b96b4096158ec934884edcacc840","tid":1660989,"uid":120942,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T05:23:41.000Z","msg":"Pushhh<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"26ccb035a30ced967f6b49d0bb895b5cf14cfdfe","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T16:22:49.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"ad79ab73ac86cc0723e675403259ce1e96c93f19","tid":1660989,"uid":332832,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T19:11:28.000Z","msg":"I&rsquo;ll post it to the nyc Lennon wall!"},{"pid":"60acfceb19080e26cfbf455e672240c1a43228e2","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"ad79ab73ac86cc0723e675403259ce1e96c93f19","tid":1660989,"uid":332832,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T19:11:28.000Z","msg":"I&rsquo;ll post it to the nyc Lennon wall!"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-19T04:13:13.000Z","msg":"Thank you mate!<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0dc2207ec593c11ec820e5cc6009c023a228d9c9","tid":1660989,"uid":332832,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"quote":{"pid":"60acfceb19080e26cfbf455e672240c1a43228e2","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"ad79ab73ac86cc0723e675403259ce1e96c93f19","tid":1660989,"uid":332832,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T19:11:28.000Z","msg":"I&rsquo;ll post it to the nyc Lennon wall!"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-19T04:13:13.000Z","msg":"Thank you mate!<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-19T04:14:09.000Z","msg":"I wish she could see that her message spread all the way to New York <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"bec8f678e03c7342f67206614caa5c95c78cf832","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"0dc2207ec593c11ec820e5cc6009c023a228d9c9","tid":1660989,"uid":332832,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"quote":{"pid":"60acfceb19080e26cfbf455e672240c1a43228e2","tid":1660989,"uid":38864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"ad79ab73ac86cc0723e675403259ce1e96c93f19","tid":1660989,"uid":332832,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T19:11:28.000Z","msg":"I&rsquo;ll post it to the nyc Lennon wall!"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-19T04:13:13.000Z","msg":"Thank you mate!<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-19T04:14:09.000Z","msg":"I wish she could see that her message spread all the way to New York <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-19T04:24:57.000Z","msg":"Please keep us updated! <br />\nWe could try to spot this lady out in Prince Edward again.
