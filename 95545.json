It's supposed to commit us to standing up for Hong Kong's rights until 2047.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;And you don't get much sense of the British government actually standing over those promises and obligations and I think that's a great pity.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n'Kowtowing' to China<br />\nLord Patten said the UK risks putting its desire to do trade with China, over its commitment to Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It's all for derisory, ludicrous reasons,&quot; he said. &quot;The argument that the only way you can do trade with China is by kowtowing to China on political issues is drivel - it's complete nonsense.&quot;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&quot;I worry about how people are prepared to sell our honour for alleged trade deals which never actually happen.

/>\n立場報道2017/1/26 &mdash; 11:50<br />\n<br />\nAAA<br />\n彭定康<br />\n彭定康<br />\n英國廣播公司（BBC）就香港主權移交20周年訪問前港督彭定康等人。彭定康在訪問中批評，英國未有履行《中英聯合聲明》的承諾及義務，未為港人出頭。他擔心，英國為求中國達成所謂的貿易協議，出賣自己的榮譽（selling its honor），他自己深深感到，已令追求民主的上一代人失望，「如果我們再讓他們的下一代失望，這會是悲劇。」<br />\n<br />\n彭定康認為，英國顯然沒有為香港出頭。「我好奇，到底我們的榮譽、責任感，發生了什麼事，這是一個英國的問題。」<br />\n<br />\n彭定康指出，中國與英國簽訂的《中英聯合聲明》，是送交聯合國的條約，直至2047年之前，英國亦理應為港人爭取權利，但英國卻未有履行這些承諾及義務，「這是相當可惜。」<br />\n<br />\n廣告<br />\n彭定康認為，英國把與中國貿易事務，置於對香港承諾之上，背後的原因「可笑、荒唐」，「有人認為，你與中國交易的唯一方法，是在政治問題上向中國『磕頭』，這是一派胡言，完全是荒謬的。」<br />\n<br />\n彭定康說，自己擔心英國出賣自己的榮譽（selling its honor），以圖與中國達成所謂的貿易協議，「認為這將是災難性的，如果真是這樣做，我們（英國）在世界還代表什麼呢？若果我們真是這樣做，這些未來由民主選舉選出的香港領袖，會憑什麼認為與英國有特別關係呢？」<br />\n <br />\n彭定康說，自己深深感到，已令追求民主一代人的上一代失望，「如果我們再讓他們的下一代失望，這會是悲劇。」<br />\n<br />\n英國外交部發言人回應稱，英國非常重視英方在中英聯合聲明的長期承諾，相信「一國兩制」是香港長期穩定繁榮的最佳安排，「一如過去二十年所見」。外交部發言人補充，定期會與中國討論尊重「一國兩制」、「高度自治」的重要性，外交大臣去年底與中方會面時也有提及。<br />\n<br />\n<a
