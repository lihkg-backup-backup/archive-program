And we&rsquo;re seeing the people there in Hong Kong, of course, demonstrating for their basic rights, for the right to freedom of speech, for freedom of assembly, all of these things which are enshrined into Basic Law.<br />\n<br />\nAnd so, of course, as we observe these, we continue to call on the Hong Kong Government to address the concerns of their public, to consult with local and international stakeholders who may be affected by this proposed amendment, even though I know it, of course, has been postponed.<br />\n<br />\nThe Secretary spoke about this a little yesterday on some of the Sunday shows that he was on and said that we&rsquo;re watching the people of Hong Kong speak about the things that we value. And I think that we have been pretty straightforward and transparent from this podium on our support for these peaceful protestors.<br />\n<br />\nQUESTION: Thank you.<br />\n<br />\nMS ORTAGUS: I will see you on Wednesday.
