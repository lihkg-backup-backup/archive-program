The Hong Kong Police arrested many protesters. When the cops were subduing one senior citizen and two young people in the car park outside Seven Seas Shopping Centre, a young man wearing a grey T-shirt with the character 岳 (ngok1), apparently with a view to making good the escape of those three compatriots, sacrificed himself by using a stick on one of the cops. The young man then ran but before long, several policemen threw him down, repeatedly hit his head with batons until it was broken. As video-recorded by NOW TV, when the man totally surrendered and stopped resisting, the police still ground his face against the rugged surface of the ground. When the subdued man was simply tying to cover his profusely bleeding cheeks with his hands, the police used pungent pepper spray at close range on his wounded face and broken head, all the while shouting, &quot;Hands off, or else we'll use pepper spray!&quot; &amp; preventing reporters from filming the scene.<br />\n<br />\nThe man was then handcuffed and arrested. <br />\n<br />\nOn the Sept 15 Press Conference, Senior Superintendent KONG Wing-cheung of Police Public Relations Branch claimed that the man had put up a violent resistance and the police had used &quot;appropriate force&quot; to subdue him.<br />\n<br />\nFB link; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/771105693327197?__tn__=-R\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhongkongbilingualnews%2Fposts%2F771105693327197%3F__tn__%3D-R&d=9iHhAbkmMxvvE1I2I23sbQCffgmrlYx1zcVg66SIO7I%3D&h=bbd98190\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/771105693327197?__tn__=-R</a><br />\n<br />\nWeb link: <a href=\"https://www.hongkongbilingualnews.com/post/hong-kong-police-spray-pepper-into-young-protester-s-wounds-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E8%AD%A6%E5%AF%9F%E5%9C%A8%E7%BE%A9%E5%A3%AB%E5%82%B7%E5%8F%A3%E5%99%B4%E8%83%A1%E6%A4%92%EF%BC%81by-chapman-chen-hkbnews\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hongkongbilingualnews.com%2Fpost%2Fhong-kong-police-spray-pepper-into-young-protester-s-wounds-%25E9%25A6%2599%25E6%25B8%25AF%25E8%25AD%25A6%25E5%25AF%259F%25E5%259C%25A8%25E7%25BE%25A9%25E5%25A3%25AB%25E5%2582%25B7%25E5%258F%25A3%25E5%2599%25B4%25E8%2583%25A1%25E6%25A4%2592%25EF%25BC%2581by-chapman-chen-hkbnews&d=9iHhAbkmMxvvE1I2I23sbQCffgmrlYx1zcVg66SIO7I%3D&h=04c95c27\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.hongkongbilingualnews.com/post/hong-kong-police-spray-pepper-into-young-protester-s-wounds-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E8%AD%A6%E5%AF%9F%E5%9C%A8%E7%BE%A9%E5%A3%AB%E5%82%B7%E5%8F%A3%E5%99%B4%E8%83%A1%E6%A4%92%EF%BC%81by-chapman-chen-hkbnews</a><br />\n<br />\nNOW TV video showing the subdued young man being tortured <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/107762980595104/posts/126483635389705?sfns=mo\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F107762980595104%2Fposts%2F126483635389705%3Fsfns%3Dmo&d=9iHhAbkmMxvvE1I2I23sbQCffgmrlYx1zcVg66SIO7I%3D&h=73276cd2\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/107762980595104/posts/126483635389705?sfns=mo</a><br />\n<br />\nCable TV video showing the young man sacrificing himself to save three other citizens. <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=633589043797049\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fwatch%2F%3Fv%3D633589043797049&d=9iHhAbkmMxvvE1I2I23sbQCffgmrlYx1zcVg66SIO7I%3D&h=57153bbb\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=633589043797049</a><br />\n<br />\n#extraditionlaw #ccp #hongkongpolicebrutality #communistChina #donaldtrump #maga2020 #keepamericagreat #fukkien #trump2020 #hongkonghumanrightsanddemocracyact #chapmanchen #HKBNews"},{"pid":"d667f169ee494bc8f8448448cc0c26714e112106","tid":1574998,"uid":263058,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-16T16:04:22.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"c1e14ee65d2be6eaef876496a98d5da7fe0e1209","tid":1574998,"uid":33930,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-16T16:09:03.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/pvsTHEi.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FpvsTHEi.jpg&h=e8bfe3ea&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\">宣佈 和你suck 4.0 9月22 星期日見<br />\n<br />\nsuck 4.0 將會基於 hkmap.live 行動  <br />\n麻煩力推呢個livemap <br />\n對各位日後行動都非常大幫助<br />\n<br />\n請各位必須係 9月22日當日12點30分留意channel / 連登 / IG 最新消息<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n連登post:<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1568754\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1568754</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<br />\n TG : <a href=\"https://t.me/stuckwithyou\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fstuckwithyou&d=9iHhAbkmMxvvE1I2I23sbQCffgmrlYx1zcVg66SIO7I%3D&h=2330bff6\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://t.me/stuckwithyou</a><br />\n<br />\nIG : <a href=\"https://instagram.com/suck.withyou\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fsuck.withyou&d=9iHhAbkmMxvvE1I2I23sbQCffgmrlYx1zcVg66SIO7I%3D&h=fbbb429e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://instagram.com/suck.withyou</a></span>"}]}
