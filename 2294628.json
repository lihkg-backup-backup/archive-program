That happens whether the user is a Chinese citizen or a foreign visitor &mdash; a policy that&rsquo;s required from all hospitality businesses operating in the country. Joyce, who Airbnb hired in May 2019 to protect the platform&rsquo;s users, was concerned with Airbnb&rsquo;s willingness to share data. Joyce also objected to the scope of the data shared, such as messages sent between guests and hosts, The Wall Street Journal reports. <span class=\"red\">He feared it could allow the Chinese government to track foreign visitors and its own citizens.</span></blockquote>"},{"pid":"0db46b764bb216f305cde99af739f40b2a4330eb","tid":2294628,"uid":284432,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-21T07:55:26.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"7a7bb14e94517cbdb3119775861e7dc1e4d61d8a","tid":2294628,"uid":12251,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-21T07:57:30.000Z","msg":"良知"},{"pid":"2faec9f4b5dd6935c1e6ffd634579a7480714c53","tid":2294628,"uid":54323,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-21T10:39:06.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/repkenbuck/status/1329872797443747842?s=12\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frepkenbuck%2Fstatus%2F1329872797443747842%3Fs%3D12&d=HaoFMq3H8OfxnxI562yM3%2BojXYTbvVfDxiGm1goFu7E%3D&h=7a1a9ec1\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frepkenbuck%2Fstatus%2F1329872797443747842%3Fs%3D12&h=8d2d6edb\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/repkenbuck/status/1329872797443747842?s=12</a>"}]}
