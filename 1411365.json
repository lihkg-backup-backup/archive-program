We are a group of Hong Kong citizens who wished to express our concern over an act of gender violence against women that has just happened in Hong Kong. <br />\n<br />\nAs you may be aware, there are protests in Hong Kong in which Hong Kong citizens are in direct opposition of the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) ill 2019 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Extradition Bill&rdquo;) proposed by the Hong Kong SAR Government to the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Recently, these protests have revealed intense police brutality and unwarranted police actions against protesters and even ordinary citizens, which constitute blatant violations of human rights.<br />\n<br />\nTonight, Hong Kong polices arrested a female protestor. She was being taken away and carried into a police station. During the arrestment, her bottoms, including her underpants slid off. The polices not only did not allow her to put them back but also opened her legs deliberately which caused her private parts being exposed in public and under cameras. The polices did not attempt to protect her privacy and this is unacceptable on any level.<br />\n<br />\nThere are sexual assault histories of Hong Kong polices. For example, in 2009, a detective constable has been sentenced to 12 years in jail for raping a teenager and molesting two others and a 21-year-old woman in a police station(1). Due to these precedent cases, it is reasonable for us to worry about this woman's situation and the circumstances. <br />\n<br />\nAmong other efforts attempting to raise international awareness and support, we humbly plead for your concern and hope you could voice out and condemn such outrageous disrespect for women. We sincerely ask for your help in raising international concern over this matter. <br />\n<br />\nThank you very much for your time<br />\n<br />\nA group of concerned Hong Kong citizens. <br />\n<br />\n(1)reference:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3018246/hong-kong-police-officer-jailed-rape-woman-he-met\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Fnews%2Fhong-kong%2Flaw-and-crime%2Farticle%2F3018246%2Fhong-kong-police-officer-jailed-rape-woman-he-met&d=UCNXK7Cjp0Jh61Qt1camEP2u4%2BaHFFj7NdFJeB1nj9U%3D&h=7da45881\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3018246/hong-kong-police-officer-jailed-rape-woman-he-met</a>"},{"pid":"19c66d3ebdf90e50101b2d54d7050940eb24cb0a","tid":1411365,"uid":203953,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-05T03:34:20.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"2eba533a40bbb78d8fd990d53d3cab4b16462b78","tid":1411365,"uid":28852,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-05T03:36:15.000Z","msg":"Push"},{"pid":"87d094a38edab8ac2dfb98a5cced624bc3f53eaf","tid":1411365,"uid":203953,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-05T04:49:55.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"1c322fe117c1ffa982f84413805a46ddaf3816ef","tid":1411365,"uid":44998,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-05T04:51:34.000Z","msg":"PUSH"},{"pid":"eb883a3178e7c49d23032b6fc6e39c9f9ad223f2","tid":1411365,"uid":149225,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-05T04:55:24.000Z","msg":"女權撚沉默多時係時候要做嘢！！！<br />\n將天水圍女仔單嘢， 除咗推畀emma watson之外， 仲要推去聯合國婦女組織！！！<br />\n<br />\nFB<br />\n<a href=\"http://facebook.com/unwomen\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com%2Funwomen&d=UCNXK7Cjp0Jh61Qt1camEP2u4%2BaHFFj7NdFJeB1nj9U%3D&h=d884a779\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">facebook.com/unwomen</a><br />\n<br />\nig<br />\n<a href=\"http://instagram.com/unwomen\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Funwomen&d=UCNXK7Cjp0Jh61Qt1camEP2u4%2BaHFFj7NdFJeB1nj9U%3D&h=2607dfd8\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/unwomen</a><br />\n<br />\nTwitter<br />\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/UN_Women\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FUN_Women&d=UCNXK7Cjp0Jh61Qt1camEP2u4%2BaHFFj7NdFJeB1nj9U%3D&h=00347a97\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">twitter.com/UN_Women</a>"},{"pid":"00b21667cc98a388d189d327e30b8ad02ac66e8b","tid":1411365,"uid":258348,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-05T04:55:30.000Z","msg":"&ldquo;slid&quot; off"},{"pid":"27cb75b0ed89acb382b7d2bbf0d72a2f0b1acaf1","tid":1411365,"uid":203953,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-05T05:40:49.000Z","msg":"push"}]}
