Its not data faking, its hedge funds hedging their shorts with calls and puts. Let me explain.<br />\n<br />\nGary Black is a guy to follow. Not always follow his advice or take everything for granted, but he gives a good insight into how hedge funds think: <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1356253412103512065\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmobile.twitter.com%2Fgaryblack00%2Fstatus%2F1356253412103512065&d=FyOxfEvlGqeE3CGJWKQQl3jBGfL1Jh2LWroBhk3D7pk%3D&h=8c642869\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmobile.twitter.com%2Fgaryblack00%2Fstatus%2F1356253412103512065&h=3f53771a\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1356253412103512065</a><br />\n<br />\nGary has the opinion, that short sellers have hedged their short position by buying ATM calls and selling ATM puts that match the share count of its short. Ok, so lets run through this scenario:<br />\n<br />\nBefore expiration, the fund doesnt do anything, he has to pay the daily fee of the short interest on his shares and he loses value on his call as well as gains value on his put (because he sold it). This can draw out the short squeeze by month!<br />\nAt expiration, if the share price is above purchase price, he can exercise the call, return the shares and the put expires worthless so he keeps the premium.<br />\nIf the share price goes down, the call expires worthless but he buys shares with the put and returns these shares to close his short position.<br />\nIn scenario 1, the short interest stays the same as nothing happens. But I can totally see the statistics to reduce the reported short position because it is fully hedged! In scenario 2, the call seller has to find the shares on the market. In scenario 3 its the same, but this time the put buyer has to find the shares.<br />\n<br />\nIN ALL 3 SCENARIOS, THE SHORT INTEREST STAYS THE SAME BUT THE REPORTED SHORT INTEREST GOES DOWN BECAUSE ITS SHOVED UNDER THE RUG OF THE OPTIONS TRADERS.<br />\n<br />\nWhich means, the statistics might be correct, but the true short interest is still the same as before! THE SHORTS ARE NOT OFF THE HOOK!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n上面有個地方我唔太明<br />\n佢咁樣靠long call同short put 還貨原理上好似真係得wo<br />\n但點解條友話咁樣只係表面降低short ratio<br />\n但實際上無還到？<br />\n依一點唔太明<br />\n有無高手可以解析到？"},{"pid":"a1f0a07319269387b2010a80c3902c98e5146961","tid":2390996,"uid":37389,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:31:02.000Z","msg":"你當佢咭冚咭<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"dd2684953db37eb3ecd22992d97a4b2b0d127dda","tid":2390996,"uid":72354,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"quote":{"pid":"a1f0a07319269387b2010a80c3902c98e5146961","tid":2390996,"uid":37389,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:31:02.000Z","msg":"你當佢咭冚咭<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:33:41.000Z","msg":"如果佢升<br />\n我exercise call之後還貨平倉<br />\n咁short ratio咁跌<br />\n如果佢跌<br />\n我execise put 接貨後再還貨平倉<br />\nshort ratio都係跌<br />\n靠咁樣慢慢平哂倉唔得咩？"},{"pid":"599295016f73ddd6413eacb304390d34bd098188","tid":2390996,"uid":72354,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:34:54.000Z","msg":"但點解條友話咁樣做個short interest係無變？<br />\n我就係唔明依點"},{"pid":"4ad0b4c0fc3640d7aad55d502772d1e17f7ee569","tid":2390996,"uid":37389,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"599295016f73ddd6413eacb304390d34bd098188","tid":2390996,"uid":72354,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:34:54.000Z","msg":"但點解條友話咁樣做個short interest係無變？<br />\n我就係唔明依點"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:40:38.000Z","msg":"咁你咭冚咭，差銀行嘅錢有無變過？無。但好處係咩？唔會咁快俾人淋紅油"},{"pid":"11e57af5b44e11b635d7aecca6289588675ce63d","tid":2390996,"uid":196721,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"599295016f73ddd6413eacb304390d34bd098188","tid":2390996,"uid":72354,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:34:54.000Z","msg":"但點解條友話咁樣做個short interest係無變？<br />\n我就係唔明依點"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:42:53.000Z","msg":"佢on99 9up當自己有料 唔好睇"},{"pid":"0d5c0dcbf472ec38684f25d52468ae1625ab78de","tid":2390996,"uid":5523,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:47:21.000Z","msg":"咩菇咩菇fire<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n咩菇咩菇fire<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a4285f5a31e1479b1873c1973bf7dfba4e26d9e1","tid":2390996,"uid":72354,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"4ad0b4c0fc3640d7aad55d502772d1e17f7ee569","tid":2390996,"uid":37389,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"599295016f73ddd6413eacb304390d34bd098188","tid":2390996,"uid":72354,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:34:54.000Z","msg":"但點解條友話咁樣做個short interest係無變？<br />\n我就係唔明依點"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:40:38.000Z","msg":"咁你咭冚咭，差銀行嘅錢有無變過？無。但好處係咩？唔會咁快俾人淋紅油"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:47:50.000Z","msg":"唔係wo<br />\n佢exercise 張call之後<br />\n將收返黎既貨還比人<br />\n咁咪還左lo<br />\n點會無還？"},{"pid":"71db65d3f525be06138967a59f060f435a326ebf","tid":2390996,"uid":72354,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"11e57af5b44e11b635d7aecca6289588675ce63d","tid":2390996,"uid":196721,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"599295016f73ddd6413eacb304390d34bd098188","tid":2390996,"uid":72354,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:34:54.000Z","msg":"但點解條友話咁樣做個short interest係無變？<br />\n我就係唔明依點"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:42:53.000Z","msg":"佢on99 9up當自己有料 唔好睇"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:48:49.000Z","msg":"所以我就係唔明依點<br />\n姐係真係可以靠依招還哂d貨？"},{"pid":"25387034f9e9ab94e38c813a67d343a7fb542714","tid":2390996,"uid":134437,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-02-02T02:48:59.000Z","msg":"in scenario 1: price increase<br />\nprofits from short stock, long call and short put, but the issues remain.
