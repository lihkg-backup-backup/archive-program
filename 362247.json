Laptop batteries have improved across the board, thanks to more-efficient processors. <br />\n<br />\n用得佢最開心係<br />\nThe 13-inch HP Spectre x360, which starts at $940, is like a fancy Swiss Army knife. It&rsquo;s a trusty companion with a responsive trackpad, full-size clickety-clackety keyboard and great speakers. And it can transform into a tablet to write on, or a screen for watching Netflix in bed.<br />\n<br />\nMost of all, the x360 requires fewer painful compromises than the best from Apple, Microsoft and others. There&rsquo;s no port drama: It has a standard USB-A for accessories you already own and two USB-C ports for charging and future add-ons. At 2.89 pounds, the x360 weighs less than the MacBook Air yet has the latest processor and a crisp HD touch screen.<br />\n<br />\nIt isn&rsquo;t perfect: The &ldquo;Windows Hello&rdquo; camera isn&rsquo;t as reliable for logging in as a fingerprint reader. And while HP claims up to 16 hours of battery life, I got only a bit more than half that in my harsh test.<br />\n<br />\nWhile you&rsquo;re in the store, also check out the 14-inch Lenovo Yoga 910, at $1,050, and my old favorite, the $800-and-up Dell XPS 13."},{"pid":"6affbdec89e8df1d1425031211aa544767291573","tid":362247,"uid":22054,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-16T19:38:52.000Z","msg":"Consumer Reports stopped recommending Microsoft laptops and tablets last week. A survey of its members who own laptops indicated some 25% of Microsoft products were having problems by the end of their second year&mdash;much higher than for other brands. (Microsoft says it tracks one- and two-year failure and return rates that are significantly lower than 25%.) Microsoft is a relatively young laptop maker, but I think it has addressed many of the problems. The Consumer Reports data didn&rsquo;t include the Surface Laptop; mine has hummed along fine for the past three months.<br />\n<br />\n買surface 既小心d"},{"pid":"dac7eddd32b510fa8523af8198edd17e822df4d7","tid":362247,"uid":22054,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-16T19:39:43.000Z","msg":"MacBook Air<br />\n<br />\ndon&rsquo;t buy it.

For one, they only come with the smaller USB-C ports, and Apple charges $25 for a cable to plug in an iPhone. Ouch.<br />\n<br />\nOur recommendation last year&mdash;an older-model 13-inch MacBook Pro&mdash;is only available refurbished.
