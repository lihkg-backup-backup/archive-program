The police attack passerby indiscriminately, as evidenced in the various confrontations since early June this year. They appear to relish in inflicting serious injuries on citizens, and habitually refuse the arrestees of their rights to seek legal representation. They employ methods such as torture and sexual abuse to procure a conviction, while also treating it as an emotional outlet. The ordinary laws as regards to making a lawful arrest no longer apply for them. The police has publicly denounced the principles of &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; and &ldquo;proportionality&rdquo;, and assumed the role of responding to all manners of public inquiries on behalf of the government.<br />\n<br />\nTo date, the whereabouts of 3 protestors who were reportedly seriously injured remain unknown, with rumours of their death circulating on the internet.<br />\n<br />\nThe police also has complete control over the city&rsquo;s railway system, where they are capable of shutting down any stations without the need of prior notice or approval, and can evict citizens from any premises and perform random searches on them without having to meet the &ldquo;reasonable suspicion&rdquo; requirement. <br />\n<br />\nThe city has entered into a state of pseudo-military control, and in a way that is historically unprecedented, the citizens themselves, hoping for self-preservation, have to declare martial law, formally recognising the graveness of the situation and erosion of rule of law, while the government cowers behind the police and continue to hide important information from the citizens. <br />\n<br />\nDear readers, please continue to support Hong Kong citizens in their pursuit of democracy and universal suffrage. <br />\n<br />\nFight for freedom, Stand with Hong Kong"}]}
