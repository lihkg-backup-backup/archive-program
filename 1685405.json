I enjoy visiting the annual winter carnival on Christmas day where I ride the thrill rides and eat pancakes soaking up the nice christmassy atmosphere. The sun has been dazzlingly hot all week so you may just as well have a good long soak in an outdoor onsen soaking up the sun. In fact I've just got out if an onsen and am towelling off. I work in Hotel JAP Tokyo. My cousin has come to stay for a few nights as company for me while my colleagues are away. (when I'm in a hotel room I usually have the television on for company until I go to bed.) My friend Alex has received a commission for a sculpture, a sketch, an oil painting and an article on picasso from the hotel. I should like to express my heartfelt congratulations for getting a commission to make a sculpture, do a sketch, paint an oil painting and write an article on picasso for the hotel since it's a once in a lifetime opportunity. I've always admired the exquisite colors of oil paintings be it a portrait or landscape. Alex's palette consists of blues greens and browns while his former classmate who's also a singer paints from a palette consisting of oranges reds and whites. A palette, a set of paintbrushes and paints normally cost around two thousand yen altogether. A colleague of mine who's recently been promoted and assigned to the company's branch in tokyo with which he's really pleased. I'm very pleased about his promotion too. If you happen to be stating in the aforementioned hotel please remember the following as I work there: First of all before washing your clothes please remove coins and tissue from the pockets and put only seventy percent of the dirty clothes in the wash tub. This will ensure your clothes to get evenly clean and the machine will less likely be out of order. Please towel off the drum after each use so as not to cause mould or mildew to grow in the drum. Second of all please don't set the air conditioner up to more than twenty five degrees celcius. Otherwise it won't blow cold air and will smell bad. Third after cleaning the tables and the toilet with detergent or sudsy water please rinse a cloth or handkerchief with clean water and wipe them again so as not to cause discoloration. Last but not least please don't nail or stick anything to the wall as the paint will peel. Finally enjoy your time in japan."}]}
