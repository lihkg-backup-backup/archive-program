We are not commenting on the extradition bill here, but to express our strong opposition regarding the force used by the Hong Kong police. <br />\n<br />\nThe assembly begins at night, 11th June 2019. The assembly is peaceful all along. The protestors are unarmed, only carrying umbrellas or wearing helmets and face masks to protect themselves. The number of policemen increases time to time, and they are carrying with guns and tear gas. However, at around HKT 3pm, 12th June 2019, the Hong Kong police has escalated their action, using tear gas and shooting rubber. Not only shown in the live report from the journalists, but also admitted by the head of the police officers in the press. The tear gas has caused eye irritations of numerous protestors. A number of protestors, journalists were hurt by the rubber shooting from the police also, noting that one of the patient has lost his consciousness as reported. We are here to express our strong opposition and anger towards the Hong Kong police and would like to raise the awareness from the whole world, particularly hoping the UN can help the citizens in Hong Kong, by imposing pressure to the Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong police to stop these unnecessary, and yet inhumane actions."},{"pid":"82269cc3dc0eaad76dc2d962879e5bc90f8e31d3","tid":1208259,"uid":256732,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-12T09:41:14.000Z","msg":"英文唔好，但都希望可以幫到手"},{"pid":"af4ef61536a3189529acd64c9f481e16614cc3c9","tid":1208259,"uid":127751,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-12T12:44:11.000Z","msg":"一齊send"},{"pid":"378b2ef98c5ae184082901c319951c3164048ad0","tid":1208259,"uid":92951,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-12T12:44:36.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yo.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"cc3bc47aa6955d7ce48376dec1893c6cab3c40f3","tid":1208259,"uid":54995,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-12T13:05:32.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
