In my opinion, you&rsquo;re correct that the world values the peaceful manner of the protests. Americans especially will respect the lack of looting. However I think it&rsquo;s very important to spread the news of why clashes occur (police brutality) and why certain shops/ MTR are renovated. It&rsquo;s easy for an image of a trashed shop to be misconstrued in the media. Maybe it would help to spray paint in english the reason for renovation."},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T20:31:22.000Z","msg":"Spray-painting simple explanation in English is a good point, though I don't know how practical would it be, as I know 'renovators' are opting for flash mob tactic, i.e. getting everything done within 5 to 10 mins. I guess ultimately most of the explanation works need to be done afterward, across the social media in particular. That's down another important principle that we are pushing for: let the front-liners do their work, and let the 'keyboard warriors' deal with the public opinion. That doesn't mean we are letting front-liners go rogue, but the decentralization nature of the protest means it's sometimes difficult to reach a consensus towards specific details of tactics."},{"pid":"840b90f72a68c9ba08ba72b35d7f40bb8c7f585a","tid":1661488,"uid":70127,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-18T20:32:58.000Z","msg":"Hongkongers are far from succeeding.<br />\n<br />\nA short answer to your question.

But, when do they start copying the means?<br />\n<br />\nThe reason (as far as I can see) that you've been so successful is because you're rapidly adapting to changing circumstances, much faster than your opponents. That, and the creativity...<br />\n<br />\nI mean, some Western guy makes some tweet and gets slammed for it by the NBA.  Within days, a HK guy stands up and knowingly gets slammed by Blizzard.  2 days later, both companies are on the run, no hope for them.  The protesters figured out how to use China's most powerful tool, the control of information, as a weapon against China and anyone that would do business with them.  Bruce Lee would be proud.<br />\n<br />\nIt's brilliant.  So simple, yet unstoppable.  If someone wants to promote X but hide Y, all you have to do is tie Y onto X a thousand different ways.  Who thought of that?  And, more importantly, how did it become the weapon of choice so quickly?  The typical boycotts started soon enough, but they rarely work.  This... this is powerful.  This ends censorship.  It will take a while, be a bit of an arms race as people get more sophisticated with it, but the end result is obvious.  If you want to censor information then you're going full-on N.Korea.  Nothing less will work.<br />\n<br />\nLuck?  No.  You've come up with a way of doing things, a process.  Maybe you're too deep in the fight to see it; maybe I'm seeing more than is really there.  I don't know yet.<br />\n<br />\nBut, I think that when the people of Catalonia copy this decision-making process, the means of getting the right answer to everyone quickly, that's when Spain will be in trouble.

Is it a function of the software. established rules, HK culture...  From that, I can get an idea of how fast it will spread.<br />\n<br />\nSo far: <br />\n* Membership security while remaining anonymous is important and you have an informal carding process.  The process is solid and that could be coded into the next software version.<br />\n* Seems there's a lot of informal reputation involved.

There is also an option to reply to a topic without bumping it, which actually makes the topic seem less useful to the algorithm and makes it fall quicker. Some topics get 'pushed' up while some get 'pulled' down. The voting system doesn't really affect where the topic is, but it does let users know how well-received the topic is, kinda like on Facebook with likes.<br />\n* Folks with the 'P' mark are usually new users of the platform who cannot rate or bump topics. These users are also limited to posting one topic per day. This wasn't the case before LIHKG became the go-to place to discuss the protests, but measures had to be taken to keep blue-ribbons/ wumaos etc. from using new accounts to post misleading information. P-marked users who signed up after June will retain their status until further notice. (Personally I think the 'P' mark system works well enough, and users are usually able to identify bad content and warn others about it.)<br />\n<br />\nIt's important to remember most users here are just your average Joe who also happens to care about the protests, meaning they don't really have a way to do major stuff. <br />\n<br />\nAs to how the decision-making process works:<br />\n* Since most of the big events happen on the weekends, we have ample time to collect information, such as government responses and news reports. Users then discuss the topic until a consensus is reached, and start thinking up ways to leverage the info for events.<br />\n* Users post topics where people vote on what they should do next via the upvote/ downvote system. With the topic, they can make suggestions to folks with more influence like politicians, who actually organise and conduct the marches.<br />\n* Frontliners don't really use LIHKG on the field, but people do use the forum as a way to relay information, which reaches the frontliners one way or another.<br />\n* There really aren't any established rules, but we all agree to stick together and not point fingers. Culture, meanwhile, doesn't do much to affect decision-making, but more so the protest ads.<br />\n<br />\nSimply put, the movement is very decentralised, and pretty much follows the model of a direct democracy.<br />\n<br />\nI hope I've given you a better idea as to how stuff works, feel free to ask more <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"975b3df0f43d3380cb16d3335fde5335b92e9e0b","tid":1661488,"uid":35236,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-19T10:40:54.000Z","msg":"Welcome, sir. <br />\nFirst,  we are not succeeding.

Of course they want it to &mdash; that way they can crackdown the movement once and for all. The movement is initiated by the crowd and there is no leader. This is a great advantage of us as anyone can put any ideas to the table and the crowd will be the judge on whether to follow or not. When enough people followed, ideas can be implemented in no time. That is a major drive on many spontaneous protest acts through the movement. <br />\n<br />\nOnline platform is utilised in a very well manner too. Although there are still major flaws with information on the internet (fake news, unnecessary provocative and offensive opinions, wumaos), LIHKG and TG groups can make instant exchange of ideas possible. Complemented by the perks in these platforms (anonymity, upvote systems etc), it keeps the conversation on the protest going 24/7. These platforms at times do a better job than the news in updating information about protests. They also allow anyone to contribute in their own way &mdash; whether it is to report updates on the protest sites, publish promotional materials for new protests, or to launch new strategies or movement in neighbours.
