The company provides cloud computing services to millions of people, meaning that a lot of websites are not accessible this afternoon. One of these is Down Detector, which tracks outages, meaning people can&rsquo;t even see if the website they want to visit is working or not. The chat service Discord has also stopped working as well as a number of other prominent pages. <br />\n<br />\nOne cryptocurrency site even said it caused a minor panic by falsely showing people the price of Bitcoin had plummeted. Matthew Price, Cloudflare CEO, tweeted: &lsquo;Aware of major @Cloudflare issues impacting us network-wide. Team is working on getting to the bottom of what&rsquo;s going on. Will continue to update.&rsquo; <br />\n<br />\nThe outage appears to have started in the past hour. Unable to check Down Detector for updates, people took to Twitter in a quest for answers. &lsquo;Sure is great that when Cloudflare goes down it takes half the Internet with it,&rsquo; one person wrote. Another roared: &lsquo;Typical illustration of how bad the internet is centralized nowadays: Cloudflare is down, most websites &amp; services being disrupted by this.&rsquo;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">The outage caused problems with the cryptocurrency website Coindesk, which tweeted: &lsquo; Due to a Cloudflare outage, we&rsquo;re getting bad data from our providers, which is showing incorrect crypto prices. &lsquo;Calm down everyone, Bitcoin is not $26.&rsquo; </span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/02/cloudflare-outage-means-websites-including-detector-10103471/?ito=article.desktop.share.top.twitter\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmetro.co.uk%2F2019%2F07%2F02%2Fcloudflare-outage-means-websites-including-detector-10103471%2F%3Fito%3Darticle.desktop.share.top.twitter&d=DMh58HXBMwQbarqDBIsRcxx0icFY2nnrImD0qQ%2FuO9w%3D&h=a80d1346\" target=\"_blank\">https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/02/cloudflare-outage-means-websites-including-detector-10103471/?ito=article.desktop.share.top.twitter</a>"},{"pid":"44eb80e97254d471462dcdad4bfc25a21bfe3188","tid":1279057,"uid":75712,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-02T14:49:43.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1bf92b3ed1ad8553c8bf6e85c4bf5088402a6912","tid":1279057,"uid":18639,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-02T14:50:42.000Z","msg":"無錯 全球有用Cloudflare擋DDOS既網站都死哂 唔單止香港<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"11ac15408b77c64edfdb352992a21dd204668684","tid":1279057,"uid":64159,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-02T14:52:34.000Z","msg":"Update - Cloudflare has implemented a fix for this issue and is currently monitoring the results.<br />\n<br />\nDescription:<br />\nMajor outage impacted all Cloudflare services globally.
