This of course was always the way of empires.  Southerners were demonized to &ldquo;justify&rdquo; the mass murder of tens of thousands of civilian women, children, and old men, and the bombing and burning of entire cities like Atlanta and Richmond during the &ldquo;Civil War.&rdquo;  The Plains Indians were dehumanized as &ldquo;savages&rdquo; while the brave men of the U.S. Army murdered tens of thousands of Indian women and children from 1865 to 1890.  Now it was the Filipinos&rsquo; turn.  At least 200,000 Filipinos were eventually murdered by the U.S. government for resisting becoming a part of the American empire.  According to historian Joseph Stromberg, only about 15,000 of them were actual combatants.<br />\n.....................<br />\n&ldquo;The great foe of democracy is plutocracy,&rdquo; Sumner declared, and militarism always fuels plutocracy.  It does so through &ldquo;robbery&rdquo; (i.e., crony capitalism), diverting the public&rsquo;s attention from their real economic problems, large government expenditures  that benefit a few well-connected defense contracting corporations, and large government expenditures and debt that make the strong stronger and the weak weaker.&rdquo;  This of course is a precise definition of how the American warfare/welfare state, funded by the Fed, has so greatly enriched the &ldquo;one percenters&rdquo; at the expense of almost everyone else, as documented in great detail by David Stockman in his book, , and by Hunter Lewis&rsquo;s.

He didn&rsquo;t mention sovereignty, nor ethnicity, nor religious or cultural identity. As such, Hong Kong&rsquo;s activists serve as a reminder of universal principles that we have become almost numb to in the age of suspicion, conspiracy theories, fake news, moral relativism and identity politics. We&rsquo;ve become accustomed to thinking about rights from the perspective of a specific group, whatever its characteristics; but here are rights being fought for in universal terms: &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; was the key word.<br />\n<br />\nThis points to what was enshrined in the international charters drawn up in the aftermath of the second world war, when a global liberal order was tentatively put in place. As the 1948 UN-adopted Universal Declaration of Human Rights puts it: &ldquo;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights&rdquo;, and all are entitled to those rights and freedoms &ldquo;without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n西方民主國家很多人民正在捱餓，民主越來越少，連溫飽權都越來越少，弄得Donald Trump做了總統，英國也要脫歐，歐盟極右得勢<br />\n為甚麼西方民主國家管治者不多派福利，改善生活，反而有很多錢去拯救別國的人民呢？試舉例說明 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/point1.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"75b9013648da5a13133cbd288034799cac9acad5","tid":1170878,"uid":251026,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-19T17:25:34.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/how-else-am-i-meant-to-live-rough-sleepers-defy-anti-begging-law\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsociety%2F2019%2Fjun%2F19%2Fhow-else-am-i-meant-to-live-rough-sleepers-defy-anti-begging-law&d=QgRa2nBc7vcC6sJiZdE62AXckNDuUEQQ0Md4EdtPbyE%3D&h=c389d611\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/how-else-am-i-meant-to-live-rough-sleepers-defy-anti-begging-law</a><br />\n<br />\nIt is an experience shared in other parts of the country, where banning orders for begging convictions under the act have prevented rough sleepers from getting emergency accommodation in freezing weather. Nationally, there were 1,320 prosecutions under the Vagrancy Act in 2018, a 6% increase from the previous year.<br />\n<br />\nPudsey, who left care aged 15 and moved to Blackpool for a fresh start, told a report by the charity Crisis &ndash; which is calling for the repeal of the act &ndash; that a banning order from the town centre meant rough sleepers could not access local homelessness services.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Since coming to Blackpool I&rsquo;ve now had 13 charges under the Vagrancy Act and I&rsquo;ve also been taken to court twice for it. Five of those warnings I was even asleep when they gave them to me, so how could that have been for begging? I just woke up to find it on my sleeping bag,&rdquo; he said.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Half the homeless in town have been given Vagrancy Act papers now, and most of them have been fined about &pound;100 and then given a banning order from the town centre. If they get caught coming back, they get done again and could go to jail, but that means all those people can&rsquo;t get into town to use the few local services there are for rough sleepers.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n西方國家有很多人正在捱餓，為甚麼有民主法治，也保障不了溫飽權呢？<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yo.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8b237037ce1fe07cebac0fbf9b170f145aa46299","tid":1170878,"uid":55657,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-19T17:27:40.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
