The total amount of students who could speak Spanish was the highest among other languages meanwhile German and French languages was in the lowest portion among students in both 2000 and 2010.<br />\n<br />\nThe figure for Spanish was the highest throughout the whole period which roses markedly from 30% in 2000 to 25% in 2010. At the same time, there was a growth for both the portion in two other languages and other types of language, they increased 5% proportionally over a period of 10 years.<br />\n<br />\nOn the contrary, there was a significant decline in the number of students who could speak native English only. It dropped to half of its percentage in 2000 to 10% in 2010. Besides, the figure for German and French were relatively stable throughout the period with 10%
