If you see a group of tough-looking guys in black clothing flagrantly smashing up a bank, conveniently near mainstream media cameras, or right under the cops' noses -- these are probably not real protesters. They are almost certainly cops. <br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\">There is a real Black Bloc. A lot of them are like the ones in the Montebello video... they'll be younger, and they'll look like they've spent more time sipping green tea at the anarchist bookstore than working out at the gym.</span></span><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\nTo my fellow protesters in the Black Bloc, please reconsider your strategy. Some may say that you are more revolutionary because you have lost your inhibitions about property rights. I won't argue the point, but when your tactic is so favored by the police that they actively try to help you, maybe you should reconsider.<br />\n<br />\nTo everyone else, please let my dream come into being: an &quot;anarchist&quot; smashes the windows of a shop, but is unexpectedly detained by ordinary citizens, and is revealed on video to be a police provocateur. Can you imagine the world the next day?"},{"pid":"94e4fac18be7fcedfb7231f188b1966cb19b7891","tid":1481886,"uid":9348,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-18T01:49:21.000Z","msg":"bai yuk bai wai yuen gin"},{"pid":"0a6717b59786c318eb0e8db6b70407923fc67259","tid":1481886,"uid":278787,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-18T01:53:15.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"0d48f00ac9ee1d077f356d37a31af374b19486dd","tid":1481886,"uid":9348,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-18T02:40:41.000Z","msg":"69 612 613 614 616 621 626 627 628 71 75 76 77 713 714 721 726 727 728 730 81 82 83 84 85 87 89 810 811 812 813 814 816 817 <span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\">818</span></span>"},{"pid":"3b7305f5c0de56be915b08aebf84f7db57e4c22d","tid":1481886,"uid":265839,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-18T02:49:30.000Z","msg":"We must let the world knows that cops using undercover agents to create riot image to the protesters."}]}
