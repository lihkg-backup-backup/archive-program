Thursday&rsquo;s test was piloted by Dave Mackay and Mike &lsquo;Sooch&rsquo; Masucci and appears to be another successful flight pushing the vehicle to new heights.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough no date has yet been provided as to when commercial operations will take place, this third powered flight is showing the company is on the final leg to realizing that goal.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s been 10 years since Sir Richard Branson initially claimed Virgin Galactic would be ready to launch passengers, gaining deposits from over 500 customers.<br />\n<br />\nFaith in the long-term aim was strong, with a customer base that stood by the company even during its darkest period when the VSS Enterprise was lost during a test flight in 2014, four years into its test program.<br />\n<br />\nVirgin Galactic had to first mourn the loss and then fight back from the tragedy, working with the findings of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation to improve their design and implement them in a new spacecraft.<br />\n<br />\nThat new ship, called VSS Unity, was eased into service, mindful of the fact any more accidents could be a hammer blow for a company facing competition from the likes of Blue Origin.<br />\n<br />\nThankfully, the test program to date has proceeded without issue, with April of this year marking the first powered test of the spacecraft since that ill-fated day four years previously. Numerous mated glide tests had taken place during the previous year to prepare for the milestone.<br />\n<br />\nVia what is an incremental test series, the second powered test followed in May, with the focus of the test to learn more about the spaceship&rsquo;s supersonic handling characteristics and control system&rsquo;s performance with vehicle parameters that were closer to the ultimate commercial configuration.<br />\n<br />\nFor that flight, the motor burned for the planned 31 seconds &ndash; which is less than the full flight duration &ndash; propelling  Unity to a speed of Mach 1.9 and an altitude of 114,500 ft.<br />\n<br />\nThursday&rsquo;s third powered flight pushed VSS Unity to new heights, literally.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-07-26-193600.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasaspaceflight.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F2018-07-26-193600.jpg&h=1e195836&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nFollowing rollout on to the runway at the Mojave Air and Space Port, the Virgin Galactic and &ldquo;The Spaceship Company&rdquo; workers conducted final checks on the mated vehicles, prior to giving the green light for VMS Eve &ndash; piloted by Todd Ericson and Kelly Latimer &ndash; and VSS Unity to take to the skies.<br />\n<br />\nThe two vehicles had a long trip to their release altitude, which was marked at 46,500 feet.<br />\n<br />\nWith additional checks conducted, the VSS Unity was released and soon after fired up her engine for a burn time marked at 42 seconds, the longest to date.<br />\n<br />\nThis saw VSS Unity achieve Mach 2.47, powering uphill to an apogee of 170,800 feet &ndash; or 32.3 miles. With the engine shut down, the spacecraft continued her upward momentum before a feathered re-entry cycle that began at 52 kilometers.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Virgin Galactic test pilots broke Mach 2 this morning, as VSS Unity took her third rocket-powered supersonic outing in less than four months,&rdquo; noted Virgin Galatic in a post flight release.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-07-26-194309.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasaspaceflight.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F2018-07-26-194309.jpg&h=ce449dda&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;After a clean release from carrier aircraft VMS Eve at 46,500 ft, pilots Dave Mackay and Mike &ldquo;Sooch&rdquo;
