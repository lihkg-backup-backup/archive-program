But petroling? The only reason I can think of is display of Chinese influence and sovereignty over its &quot;vassal states&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nSuch acts would make future expansionist policies so much easier once foreign countries get used to seeing Chinese forces walking around in plain sight.<br />\n<br />\nWe should all be alarmed.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/kE0QQtL.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FkE0QQtL.jpg&h=1e4bbe49&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/fJjVg8M.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FfJjVg8M.jpg&h=e057be3b&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/PjERzVs.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FPjERzVs.jpg&h=0cf7dce6&s={SIZE}\" />"}]}
