The excessive use of force by the police has since been highly controversial. Evidence provided by the media, protestors and citizens reveals major violation of the Police Force Ordinance, including xxxxxx. The gangster-ambush targeted at passerby and MTR passengers in Yuen Long yesterday (22 July 2019) further proved the HK Police to be incapable of fulfilling its duty in matters outside of the said protests. <br />\n<br />\nYuen Long gangster-groups claimed days before the incident that such an ambush was organized, stating that passerby wearing black would be attacked. At around 6pm on Sunday, members of the mob, all wearing white and armed, were seen wandering the streets of Yuen Long, and later chasing after a man in grey top. The police however took no actions towards the attack. At 11pm the same evening, group of tens in the &lsquo;white attire&rsquo; stormed into Yuen Long station, assaulted civilians in aggressive manners, among the injured are journalists, a member of the LegCo, a pregnant woman and numerous citizens. At 11:16pm, the mob retreated and police arrived right after. [During the minutes of violence calls for emergency service were all unsuccessful.]<br />\n<br />\nThe willful absence on the police&rsquo;s part is the major cause for the tragic incident, as detailed below:<br />\n<br />\n1. when civilians were under attack, calls for police force via the emergency line (999) were unable to get through;<br />\n2. a video revealed police to be present, but turned their back to the scene;<br />\n3. a video shows staff closing police station[s] at the time of the incident.<br />\n<br />\nSince the first attack of the night the police force took 5 hours to arrive, during which all calls (a great number) for help were unanswered. The coinciding times of the attackers leaving and policing arriving raise serious suspicion that must not be overlooked. On the same night, police responded to the protests in Central and Sheung Wan with committed enthusiasm which we see in the use again of rubber bullets headshots, fired over 30 times without prior warnings. The great contrast tells only the fact that the function and legitimacy of HK Police has perished. The police is now nothing more than a political tool used against any anti-government demonstrations."},{"pid":"da09c7b5f65d42bd5a23555d273e9a5d2e59b0cc","tid":1353609,"uid":79744,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-23T03:58:30.000Z","msg":"In a democratic society, the legitimacy of a law-enforcer, in this context the police force, derives from people&rsquo;s recognition, public cooperation and the their capability in fighting crime.
