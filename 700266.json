Like all dietary supplements, Protandim has not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and &quot;is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.&quot;[3] The efficacy of Protandim in humans has been investigated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, which showed it to have no significant overall effect on SOD or oxidative stress levels.[4][5][6]"}]}
