It is equally worth noting that that prosecutor did not press any charges against Mr Assange and that in 2017, after interviewing him in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, she discontinued investigations and brought an end to the case.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The working group is further concerned that Mr Assange has been detained since 11 April 2019 in Belmarsh prison, a high-security prison, as if he were convicted for a serious criminal offence. This treatment appears to contravene the principles of necessity and proportionality envisaged by the human rights standards.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The WGAD reiterates its recommendation to the government of the United Kingdom, as expressed in its opinion 54/2015, and its 21 December 2018 statement, that the right of Mr Assange to personal liberty should be restored.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nA government spokesperson said: &ldquo;The UK has a close working relationship with UN bodies and is committed to upholding the rule of law. Sentencing is a matter for our independent judges, who take into account the full facts of each case, and the law provides those convicted with a right of appeal.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nAssange appeared in court on Thursday via video link from Belmarsh as he began a legal fight against extradition to the US, where he is wanted on charges relating to the publication of secret US files leaked by Chelsea Manning, a US intelligence analyst who was subsequently jailed.<br />\n<br />\nThey included approximately 90,000 reports about the war in Afghanistan, 400,000 Iraq war reports and 800,000 Guant&aacute;namo Bay detainee assessments, as well as US diplomatic cables.<br />\n<br />\nAssange declined to consent to his extradition, saying: &ldquo;I do not wish to surrender myself for extradition for doing journalism that has won many, many awards and protected many, many people.&rdquo;<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/03/un-calls-for-julian-assanges-release-from-high-security-uk-jail\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmedia%2F2019%2Fmay%2F03%2Fun-calls-for-julian-assanges-release-from-high-security-uk-jail&d=piXtWL8Gd%2FER6BG70pbW96jPH3pfKCXBWMLigY0rPLs%3D&h=0534879f\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/03/un-calls-for-julian-assanges-release-from-high-security-uk-jail</a>"},{"pid":"81b82b2aa9d15fd9d912227550dee93be23c5ecf","tid":1137958,"uid":251026,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-05-04T17:52:42.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange#Honours_and_awards\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJulian_Assange%23Honours_and_awards&d=piXtWL8Gd%2FER6BG70pbW96jPH3pfKCXBWMLigY0rPLs%3D&h=60e21831\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange#Honours_and_awards</a><br />\n2008, The Economist New Media Award[386]<br />\n2009, Amnesty International UK Media Awards[387]<br />\n2010, Time Person of the Year, Reader's Choice[388]<br />\n2010, Sam Adams Award[389]<br />\n2010, Le Monde Readers' Choice Award for Person of the Year[390]<br />\n2011, Free Dacia Award[391]<br />\n2011, Sydney Peace Foundation Gold Medal[392]<br />\n2011, Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism[393]<br />\n2011, Voltaire Award for Free Speech[394]<br />\n2012, Big Brother Award Italy 2012 &quot;Hero of Privacy&quot;[395]<br />\n2013, Global Exchange Human Rights Award, People's Choice[396]<br />\n2013, Yoko Ono Lennon Courage Award for the Arts[397]<br />\n2013, New York Festivals World's Best TV &amp; Films Silver World Medal[398]<br />\n2014, Union of Journalists in Kazakhstan Top Prize[399]<br />\n2019, GUE/NGL Galizia prize[400]<br />\n<br />\nAssange 拎過咁多journalism獎，而家就話佢係罪犯，美國政府擺到明同成個記者行業過唔去"}]}
