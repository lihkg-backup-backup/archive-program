Yost is working off of a previous script from Lisa Joy, the co-creator of HBO&rsquo;s Westworld.<br />\n<br />\nSony hopes to find a director soon so that they can start shooting by this fall. Matt Tolmach and Amy Pascal are producing the movie, which was previously known as the &ldquo;secret female spinoff project.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nLike Venom, this Black Cat/Silver Sable movie will not be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It&rsquo;ll be set in Sony&rsquo;s own universe."},{"pid":"4e1fc3bdaf02191df430b3cf29d4f1c14ef68323","tid":167586,"uid":110,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-23T02:54:56.000Z","msg":"黑貓就算鳩數啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6eb1c0808115e80089e2afa647e3b7de194e844f","tid":167586,"uid":34123,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-23T04:47:28.000Z","msg":"Silver Sable<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
