Her aunt flow is visiting. She has painful cramps right now so she's going to take a day of period leave. Her sister also feels bloated which means her period is going to come soon. She's had stomach cramps recently too but her period is late this month; it's one and a half weeks late. Today, she's being so emotional as it's that time of the month again. Her cousin, Jane missed her period so she might be pregnant. Her cousin's husband did his leg workout this morning during which he overtrained his legs so he's got cramps in his legs and right foot. Celine's brother will be attending a party this weekend but I won't be going with him for fear that I should cramp his style. I don't wanna put any pressure on him that wouod cramp his style. I don't want him to be under pressure which would cramp his style."}]}
