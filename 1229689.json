The protesters are still fighting an uphill battle against Beijing&rsquo;s determination to push the extradition law through, but the first cracks in political support for the bill appeared on Friday with the news that one of chief executive Carrie Lam&rsquo;s top advisers, plus at least one pro-China lawmaker, now believe discussion the bill should be placed on indefinite hold."},{"pid":"7539d6d89701cf5c04ddf8668eaee0695e48101a","tid":1229689,"uid":215715,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-16T04:30:18.000Z","msg":"pish"},{"pid":"075e3110a81ca3c0100ced380fc75e4d655b669a","tid":1229689,"uid":42767,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-16T04:32:20.000Z","msg":"最尾果段highlight <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"75cf52f4ac8cc223f64389c84aa29c182b8d9b7e","tid":1229689,"uid":215715,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"075e3110a81ca3c0100ced380fc75e4d655b669a","tid":1229689,"uid":42767,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-16T04:32:20.000Z","msg":"最尾果段highlight <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-16T04:42:14.000Z","msg":"好有可能係全體畜聾<br />\n得CTRU去東突集中營把撚"}]}
