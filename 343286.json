It helps you love yourself more. Knowledge of your own body can be incredibly empowering &mdash; and the more you tune in to your mind and body, the happier you'll be in your relationships. Dr. Cuascud suggests that you first get a mirror and try looking at your own genitals. If you're shy, begin in a slow, nonsexual manner and work your way up as you become more comfortable.<br />\n<br />\n2. It can make sex with others better. Some people think that women who use vibrators or other toys will have a hard time orgasming with someone else, but experts say that masturbation is one of the best ways to figure out what you like in bed, and subsequently, how to guide your sexual partners. Do yourself and your partner a favor by carving out some &quot;me&quot; time.<br />\n<br />\n3. It can boost your confidence and body image. It's like the saying goes: Masturbation is sex with a person you love, right? Bust out your gadgets, videos, or do it the old-fashioned way to build up your self-esteem, because, believe it or not, pleasing yourself is an easy way to improve your outlook on life. &quot;You cultivate very good feelings with yourself, and you can transfer that to the rest of the world,&quot; says Dr. Cuascud. &quot;Confidence is the most potent aphrodisiac.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n4. It's good for your vagina. While many women already know the benefits of kegels, some don't know that they can get similar benefits from masturbation. Orgasms help keep your pelvic floor strong and healthy, which can prevent urinary incontinence and promote your overall sexual health. Contracting your muscles can also help relieve cramps during your period.<br />\n<br />\n5. It'll help you sleep better. You know that amazing feeling after sex when all you want to do is roll over and close your eyes? Dr. Cuascud attributes that to the flood of endorphins released after you have an orgasm, which promote deeper sleep (and getting enough sleep is really important in your 20s). You can get the same benefit with masturbation, and you'll be going mimis in no time.<br />\n<br />\n6. It's good for your heart. Heart disease is the no. 1 killer of women, but fitting in a regular exercise regime is easier said than done. Luckily, self-stimulation can get your blood flowing too. In fact, several studies suggest that women who experience more orgasms, alone or with a partner, are less susceptible to heart disease and type-2 diabetes.<br />\n<br />\n7. It's safe. Unless you start to feel that masturbating is negatively impacting other aspects of your life (such as relationships with friends or family), it's one of the safest ways to satisfy your sexual needs, so whether you're going through a dry spell or simply want to indulge in some alone time, masturbation is one of the best ways to do that and not have to worry about STDs or pregnancy.<br />\n<br />\n8. It reduces stress. You get a natural high when you orgasm and you don't have to rely on another person for this wonderful feeling. Some (though not all) studies suggest it can even help prevent depression. Feeling down?

Training For Speed<br />\nSome guys have trained themselves to rub one out quickly, which can lead to ejaculating sooner than they'd like when they're getting it on with their sweetheart. &ldquo;This can even lead to premature ejaculation issues over the long term,&rdquo; says Antonia Hall, MA., a psychologist, relationship expert and sexpert and the award-winning author of The Ultimate Guide to a Multi-Orgasmic Life."},{"pid":"a77e0a541b75a7a9649b05ef584a63ccabcf5cdb","tid":343286,"uid":100760,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-01T14:30:15.000Z","msg":"2. Is It Becoming A Crutch?<br />\nMany men practice masturbation in the wild hope they will suddenly start lasting longer. That&rsquo;s actually not likely to happen.<br />\n <br />\n&ldquo;Weak erections and early ejaculation are very real problems for over 30% of the male population,&rdquo; says Jacqui Olliver, The technique modifier at End the Problem and creator of Sex Mastery: Hard AND in Control! While a useful tool for practicing techniques to last longer, masturbation becomes dangerous when it is used as a crutch to avoid having sex with a partner. &ldquo;This is because masturbating to the point of ejaculation reduces a man's desire for sex which then impacts his partner and causes (her) to wonder why he masturbates but won't have sex with her. This can lead to unnecessary confusion and stress in his relationship,&rdquo; says Olliver.<br />\n<br />\n3. Chemical Overload<br />\nAs we said, there always can be too much of a great thing. And then it&rsquo;s not so great. &ldquo;When you masturbate, your body starts to kick out hormones and neurotransmitters, which can be healthy in moderation, but can lead to an imbalance when overly generated,&rdquo; says Hall. &ldquo;Eastern philosophies have warned about ejaculating too frequently as a drain on men's health for thousands of years,&rdquo; says Hall. These physical symptoms can include back pain, tired, dry eyes, and problems with vision, fatigue and even hair loss.<br />\n<br />\n4. Guilt/Shame Spirals<br />\nDepending upon the messages one was raised with, there can be a lot of shame or guilt that comes with masturbating and finding pleasure through the body. &ldquo;These psychological messages can lead to physiological symptoms if they're not addressed. It's important to question if the messages we're raised with resonate as true for us as adults so they don't limit our happiness,&rdquo; says Hall.<br />\n<br />\n5. Difficulty Getting An Erection Or Reaching Climax<br />\nOverdoing anything is unhealthy for the body, and with overly frequent masturbation a guy may find that his erection is just not getting as firm as he'd like. &ldquo;Similarly, reaching climax may become more difficult. All of this should reset itself if he reduces his masturbatory practices for a while,&rdquo; says Hall.<br />\n<br />\n6. Skin Issues<br />\nAny chronic rubbing of the skin can cause chafing, where the skin barrier becomes disrupted leading to dryness and  irritation. &ldquo;To avoid chaffing, use a moisturizer or lubricant to allow for gliding over the skin, which prevents chafing. It&rsquo;s the same concept behind putting petroleum jelly on the nipples before a marathon to prevent chronic rubbing,&rdquo; says New York-based celebrity dermatologist Josh Zeichner.<br />\n<br />\n7. Hand Pain<br />\nHave you ever used your computer for 12 hours straight and noticed your hands painfully locked in that position after? It&rsquo;s known as carpal tunnel syndrome, and it&rsquo;s evidenced by numbness and weakness or pain in your hand, due to pressure on the nerves on your wrist. Guess what else can cause that? Yup. &ldquo;Carpal tunnel syndrome is a disorder caused by compression of the media nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel of the hand,&rdquo; says Christopher Hollingsworth, MD of NYC Surgical Associates. &ldquo;Most often it is caused by repetitive wrist motion that occurs at work, although it could absolutely be caused by hobbies like masturbation. If you find that during masturbation you have pain, tingling or numbness in the thumb, index finger or middle finger, you may be giving yourself carpal tunnel syndrome and might want to dial it back a notch,&rdquo; says Dr. Hollingsworth. But there is always surgical correction with a carpal tunnel release if you want to continue unimpeded, says Dr. Hollingsworth.<br />\n <br />\nWhile you&rsquo;re at it, tennis elbow is also a potential issue.

Hormonal Imbalances<br />\nGetting off is going to involve the same hormones as sex, and doing it too much can cause your hormones to go haywire, in a singular direction.<br />\n <br />\n&ldquo;In my practice, the untoward side effects I see from over-masturbation are usually related to the neurochemical pathways which result in an increase in inflammatory factors such as cortisol, prostaglandin and certain interleukin levels,&rdquo; says Dima Ali, M.D. of Wellmedica Aesthetic &amp; Anti-Aging Medicine, Reston, VA, a cosmetic dermatologist/laser surgeon and anti-aging medicine expert. These can increase physiologically with normal levels of masturbation but can become overstimulated with excessive/addictive forms, resulting in hormonal imbalances and altered neurochemical pathways. &ldquo;I have treated men for symptoms ranging from chronic pain and fatigue to thinning hair, adult acne, prostatitis, penile dermatitis/psoriasis, obesity and even impotence that have all resolved once the behavior normalized,&rdquo; Dr. Ali says.<br />\n<br />\n9.

Chronic infections of the penis, such as balanitis (more commonly seen in uncircumcised men), and outbreaks of Herpes II are also more common with excessive masturbation due to the increased chance of skin breakage. &ldquo;Stress also decreases both the body&rsquo;s ability to produce natural lubricating factors and to heal such lesions, which can result in difficult-to-treat/chronic conditions. The good news is that cessation of the behavior is often a cure,&rdquo; says Dr. Ali."}]}
