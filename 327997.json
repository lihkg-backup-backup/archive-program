If they&rsquo;re ever to cross over, Lok Ma Chau is the main station they&rsquo;re going to come through...<br />\n<br />\nWinterfell &ndash; Sheung Shui<br />\nTrue, Sheung Shui might not be as grand as the seat of house Stark, but stranded up there in the New Territories, beyond Tai Po, beyond even Fanling, it&rsquo;s one of the last bastions of Westeros Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nThe Eyrie &ndash; Tai Mo Shan<br />\nThe Peak may grab the headlines but it&rsquo;s Tai Mo Shan that&rsquo;s our highest point. Thus, it&rsquo;s only fitting the mountain (not The Mountain) gets to be home to The Eyrie. Now that CY has departed we&rsquo;ll have to think of another individual to eject via the Moon Door.<br />\n<br />\nHarrenhal &ndash; Ma Wan Fishing Village<br />\nA place of great expectations now left in near ruins, Ma Wan Fishing Village is eerily reminiscent of the great castle of Harrenhal. Abandoned and falling into disrepair, Ma Wan is in fact just one of Hong Kong&rsquo;s many ghost towns.<br />\n<br />\nThe Twins &ndash; Tsing Yi <br />\nNo Red Weddings here, just many shipping containers. A less dramatic spot than the real Twins, then. Still, while there might not be much to visit on Tsing Yi, but as a bridge to Lantau and the airport, it&rsquo;s an equally vital location.<br />\n<br />\nDorne &ndash; Discovery Bay<br />\nDorne is a remote region of Westeros with a reputation for sexual licentiousness. Sounds exactly like Discovery Bay, then. Okay, all those rumours of orgies and swinging in DB have never been proven, but there&rsquo;s no smoke without fire, right?<br />\n<br />\nThe Iron Islands &ndash; Tai O Fishing Village<br />\nA seafaring people, those of the Iron Islands never like to stray far from the sea. And that&rsquo;s pretty much what goes on over in Tai O, where the houses still sit on stilts above the water and the sea provides a livelihood.<br />\n<br />\nCasterly Rock &ndash; Central<br />\nSitting atop gold mines, Casterly Rock is the richest part of the Seven Kingdoms. Naturally, Central and its concentration of banks is the perfect parallel. No, this isn&rsquo;t implying bankers are like the Lannisters and villains of the whole tale. I mean, they pay their debts, right?<br />\n<br />\nKing&rsquo;s Landing &ndash; Admiralty<br />\nAnd in any case, while the wealth may lie in Central it&rsquo;s Admiralty where political power resides in Hong Kong. Our city&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s Landing, Admiralty is home to Legco and much of the government apparatus. The area is also home to the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army barracks &ndash; perhaps then the Dreadfort is a more appropriate comparison?<br />\n<br />\nDothraki Sea &ndash; Happy Valley<br />\nMoving over to Essos now, what are the Dothraki known for? Horses and buff men, basically. And where do you find the two of those in Hong Kong? Happy Valley, where the Jockey Club is centred and where the rugby teams butt heads.<br />\n<br />\nMeereen &ndash; Causeway Bay on a Sunday<br />\nLargest of the three Slaver Cities of Slaver&rsquo;s Bay, we imagine Meereen must look an awful lot like Causeway Bay on a Sunday. After all, that&rsquo;s the only time when the city&rsquo;s indentured domestic helpers get time off and are made visible instead of silently toiling in the background.<br />\n<br />\n原文<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/hong-kong/blog/if-game-of-thrones-was-set-in-hong-kong-071717\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timeout.com%2Fhong-kong%2Fblog%2Fif-game-of-thrones-was-set-in-hong-kong-071717&d=lNIyJFIRD0PfSKnn5K6k0AKEmdudW1rq3V1Y15kzxIU%3D&h=4d5a187f\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.timeout.com/hong-kong/blog/if-game-of-thrones-was-set-in-hong-kong-071717</a>"},{"pid":"98052556b943a9cc771b8ef5bfe27251471157ce","tid":327997,"uid":124450,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-19T08:36:49.000Z","msg":"House Stark House Lannister 係邊個做先"},{"pid":"6a687fc14104b075be734bc82370e4a2b638c1c5","tid":327997,"uid":17503,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-19T10:32:43.000Z","msg":"咁唔怪得jon snow俾nights watch出賣插死<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n放啲支那野人落嚟<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b50db3441e7df3afd7f370ac5e9d7da94f3d4f2a","tid":327997,"uid":72730,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-19T10:36:00.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>咁唔怪得jon snow俾nights watch出賣插死<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n放啲支那野人落嚟<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 原來係咁"},{"pid":"04571a390c57678736182fb8d477a4cd25863927","tid":327997,"uid":89301,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-19T12:08:59.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>咁唔怪得jon snow俾nights watch出賣插死<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n放啲支那野人落嚟<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n其實個情況好似<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/37.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n假如用呢個設定既話"},{"pid":"caa307d7502702e21edf5457ebff053c0c3304e0","tid":327997,"uid":56544,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-19T12:12:41.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>咁唔怪得jon snow俾nights watch出賣插死<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n放啲支那野人落嚟<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n你咁講突然好同情插死jon snow班友<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"37d5bf515aaba00bc3c37cdc83c533046e5177a0","tid":327997,"uid":35783,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-19T12:13:22.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><blockquote>咁唔怪得jon snow俾nights watch出賣插死<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n放啲支那野人落嚟<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n其實個情況好似<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/37.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n假如用呢個設定既話</blockquote><br />\n上青樓 屌左個大陸妹<br />\n返唔到轉頭"},{"pid":"2a9d296dac7ae0f04865fd2bf355fbeb275b8e6b","tid":327997,"uid":20820,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-19T12:18:43.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>咁唔怪得jon snow俾nights watch出賣插死<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n放啲支那野人落嚟<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n其實個情況好似<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/37.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n假如用呢個設定既話</blockquote><br />\n上青樓 屌左個大陸妹<br />\n返唔到轉頭</blockquote><br />\n但wildlings會同你一齊對抗walkers<br />\n大陸人落黎同其他大陸人入侵hong kong<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e305d88ee28cd3d03b9b15babdc36b96f972156b","tid":327997,"uid":20820,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-19T12:19:38.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>House Stark House Lannister 係邊個做先</blockquote><br />\n有邊個honourable man做ned?<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"bca89639dbcda10562c79f4e05ac04ed9bc2e6fd","tid":327997,"uid":35783,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-07-19T12:22:31.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><blockquote>House Stark House Lannister 係邊個做先</blockquote><br />\n有邊個honourable man做ned?<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\nlannister 郭峰<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
