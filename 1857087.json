How can you get into the network? For that you typically need to find vulnerabilities in the way software operates, which can be weaponised into an exploit. Exploitable vulnerabilities are hard to find. Often they are specific to a piece of equipment or a particular network. Often you need to string a chain of exploits together. And if they are super great, the chances are Five Eyes agencies will need to disclose them, as the US National Security Agency did recently when it found a Windows 10 security flaw.<br />\n<br />\nAs a citizen, I&rsquo;m glad that hacking is difficult and that Five Eyes agencies think it more important to protect their own national networks than to pursue those of their adversaries.<br />\n<br />\nBut Chinese intelligence agencies have a mortgage on Jack&rsquo;s proverbial beanstalk&mdash;scaled and persistent access to hundreds of foreign telco networks via legally compelled Chinese suppliers of competitively priced, high-quality technology to these telcos.<br />\n<br />\nCybersecurity is all about raising the costs for the attacker. Network access through vendors&mdash;which need to be all over 5G networks to maintain their equipment&mdash;effectively reduces the access cost to zero.<br />\n<br />\nMuch of the 5G debate has been about whether the core of the network&mdash;where sensitive data and functions reside in a 4G format&mdash;can be protected in a 5G setting. Telcos currently protect the core of their 4G networks by maintaining a physical and logical separation between the core and the less secure, customer-facing edge of the network."},{"pid":"16434b68431c3ec6d23ec9ed48ee7f80f6b454cc","tid":1857087,"uid":161726,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-02T04:26:44.000Z","msg":"咁咪岩囉<br />\n非核心可以用華為<br />\n核心唔用<br />\n但係冇分非核心同核心<br />\n姐係全部都唔係非核心，唔洗用<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/smile3.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b0dc5c8b4fafac8b23bc68bbc9f074187ea65d16","tid":1857087,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-02T04:27:36.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"color: red;\">But with 5G, all network functionality is virtualised and takes place within a single cloud environment. That means there is no physical or logical separation between the core and edge of the network.</span><br />\n<br />\nA recent Financial Times editorial approvingly cites testimony to UK parliamentary hearings last year that &lsquo;the distinction [between core and edge] would still be valid in Britain, however; geographical differences meant its networks would be designed differently from Australia&rsquo;s&rsquo;.<br />\n<br />\nI struggle to understand what this means. It reminds me of the vague, faux authoritative language techies use to talk down to civilians with humanities degrees. If it means the relative size of the United Kingdom allows its telcos to avoid distributing sensitive data and functions right to the edge of the network, I&rsquo;m still not convinced.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Geography is not a factor in how core&ndash;edge works. The reality is mature 5G networks actually require the collapse of the core&ndash;edge distinction. 5G can only reach its potential for speed and low latency if sensitive functions can happen at the edge of the network close to the customer. And 5G can only realise its cost-saving potential if any function can occur at the most efficient place in the network, wherever that is.</span> In mature 5G networks, sensitive data and functions will be distributed throughout the network in a dynamic way which will be impossible to govern with certainty.</strong><br />\n<br />\nSure, many telcos (including in Australia) are already operating networks branded as &lsquo;5G&rsquo;, on the basis that they deploy new, more efficient 5G radios at the edge of the network. But the hyperconnected, transformational 5G future marketed by the telcos can only be realised if there is no distinction between core and edge.<br />\n<br />\nTelcos could limit their 5G offerings to smart radios at the edge, but that would be like a layer cake with one layer. Who would buy that?<br />\n<br />\nIn one sense, we should only be moderately concerned about the exposure of sensitive data which in a 5G world would no longer be protected in the network core. Even if an adversary had access to this data, implementation of strong encryption can theoretically protect its confidentiality (are my communications private?) and integrity (have my communications been altered?). This is not foolproof&mdash;adversary supercomputers would have direct access to all the ones and the zeros and exploitation of poor implementation of encryption is not uncommon in the signals intelligence game."},{"pid":"254f0a3e328bfcb696f66a62984b2c43e42dbdc9","tid":1857087,"uid":253016,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-02T04:28:34.000Z","msg":"岩架啦 日落狗快D用<br />\n快D唔好等"},{"pid":"38770922f890838fc7eb7cfcd06d7868ad5cfe2a","tid":1857087,"uid":28818,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-02T04:32:49.000Z","msg":"香港又有歷史古蹟俾政府拆喇 嘈過石獅子 深水埗警署嘅人去咗邊<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1857079\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1857079</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"}]}
