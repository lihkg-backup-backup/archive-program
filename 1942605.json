The situation there looked grim&mdash;the city had 70 cases of COVID-19 and two deaths, and officials were refusing calls to fully close the border with mainland China. To stay safe, <span style=\"color: red;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">Wong and her family decided to fly halfway across the world to Philadelphia, where her husband is from.</span></span> There were no cases there yet, and just 15 in the U.S. They planned to stay for up to two months to avoid the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak that was increasingly threatening China&rsquo;s neighbors.<br />\n<br />\nLess than a month later, she fled again, this time back home to Hong Kong&mdash;booking her return tickets on March 13, the same day U.S. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. By that time, the first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Philadelphia, hundreds were reported in New York state and cases across the U.S. had soared to more than 2,000.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;It was actually an obvious decision to come back,&rdquo; Wong says. &ldquo;Hong Kong seemed safer. Even in the suburbs, you don&rsquo;t know how many people have gone to New York or other states, and come back to Philadelphia.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nWong&rsquo;s family is one of several that fled Asia as the coronavirus spread across China, only to decide that their refuge thousands of miles away had suddenly become even riskier. That there-and-back-again ordeal shows the rapid global spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, which has now infected more than 380,000 people in nearly every corner of the world.<br />\n<br />\nRead more: Will Coronavirus Ever Go Away?

Authorities are concerned that returnees from the U.S. and Europe&mdash;including students who were studying abroad&mdash;are a major cause of a new round of infections."},{"pid":"62a1c4d7c37895f7da12cdd217d97eb8271a6150","tid":1942605,"uid":312242,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-25T07:34:45.000Z","msg":"屌你老母返嚟香港播毒"},{"pid":"8fbbd23ab134c21d8bdd4a50800f36d58bd679e3","tid":1942605,"uid":351663,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-25T07:37:25.000Z","msg":"屌去北極啦"},{"pid":"324c42b4c14fb87770f874754bd80d5e758c0638","tid":1942605,"uid":109494,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-25T07:37:52.000Z","msg":"讓中国感染全世界"}]}
