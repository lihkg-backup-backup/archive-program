Without such intervention, the move would affect most of the 2.1 million federal employees around the nation, about 1.7 million of which live in areas outside of the Washington, D.C., metro area.<br />\n<br />\nMembers of the military, on the other hand, are on schedule to receive a 2.6 percent pay increase.<br />\n<br />\nLast year, the Trump administration approved a 1.4 percent increase in federal pay and a 2.4 percent increase in military pay.<br />\n<br />\nIn the letter, Trump said he had the authority to propose an alternative pay schedule based on Title V of the U.S. Code, which allows the president to alter scheduled pay changes he deems inappropriate in light of &quot;national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nTrump's 2019 budget proposal sought to freeze federal pay, but the Senate Appropriations Committee included a 1.9 percent pay bump in its spending plans for 2019. The House version of the bill did not include such an increase, and sought reductions to spending on federal pension plans.<br />\n<br />\nThe two chambers are scheduled to meet in the coming weeks to work out the differences between their bills, negotiations which could effectively override Trump's move to cut pay. Trump has not indicated if he would veto such a measure if it included a pay increase."},{"pid":"c1513428725ac42f269060273b56868001d0256a","tid":800388,"uid":134071,"like":2,"dislike":2,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-08-30T23:52:01.000Z","msg":"Democrats, and some Republicans, blasted the move.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;For someone who claims to be a leadership maven, President Trump certainly gives the impression through his actions that he has no idea how to run an effective organization,&quot; said Rep.

Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) wrote in a tweet that Trump's actions &quot;screwed&quot; federal employees.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;To the hard-working federal employees Trump just screwed by cutting pay &mdash; the folks who run our parks, protect our communities, &amp; serve our veterans: YOU MATTER. If billionaires can get tax cuts, you should get a [cost of living adjustment]. You work hard for America &amp; that should add up to something,&quot; he wrote.<br />\n<br />\nRep.

of the decade,&quot; he added.<br />\n <br />\nThe federal deficit has exploded under Trump, with the advent of the GOP tax law that is projected to cost $1.9 trillion over the course of a decade, as
