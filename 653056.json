/>\n利申：我不反對婚前破處，亦不反對婚前守貞<br />\n我的論點是<br />\n守貞係當事人雙方的選擇，其價值是由他們去決定。<br />\n守貞這個行為本身無內在價值<br />\n因此旁人根本無資格去論斷當事人<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n以下為反駁<br />\n／事實上只有非處/player/現任女朋友或老婆係非處嘅人會不斷宣掦非處冇問題／<br />\n證據？無證據即係鳩估啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n／藉此令自己唔會因為非處嘅身份而貶值／<br />\n你根本預設咗處女呢個身分本身有價值先<br />\n問題你又無解釋過點解有價值<br />\n如果處女膜本身無價值，咁就算破處都唔係貶值啦<br />\n<br />\n／以「開放」為理由務求令其他女仔都變非處，噉自己就可以合理化自己嘅行為／<br />\n按照你的做法<br />\n其實我一樣可以預設破處係一件非常有價值的事<br />\n然後話「根本無須合理化婚前破處，因為破處本身就係合理而且非常之好」<br />\n<br />\n你的論點根本一開始就預設「處」係有價值，但又無提出任何理由支持<br />\n<br />\n／Player又係，以「咩年代」作為藉口，以此食處<br />\n唔係嘅話你想啲player結婚先扑？佢即走啦／<br />\n<br />\n你可以不認同player的動機（我也不認同）<br />\n但係你不能以player的人格作為理由否定其「破處無所謂」的論點<br />\n因為這樣就犯了「訴諸人身」的謬誤<br />\n<br />\n／而現任係非處嘅人為咗麻醉自己，就會以「咩年代」做自欺欺人嘅藉口，務求忘記自己食二手閪嘅處境／<br />\n證據？你又知非處者的配偶係咁諗？<br />\n<br />\n／非處可惡、player可恨，現任係非處嘅人可憐<br />\n但以上都係仆街，為咗自身利益/自欺欺人去宣揚錯誤觀念<br />\n佢哋話接受非處係「成熟」嘅表現？／<br />\n<br />\n咁點解「非處」係一樣唔好（「可惡」）嘅嘢？<br />\n<br />\n／「處女咪又係一塊膜」<br />\n$1000都可以只係一張紙<br />\n只有班非處會以此作藉口務求自己唔好貶值／<br />\n<br />\n比喻不倫<br />\n$1000之所以有價值，係因為背後有政府擔保其價值，<br />\n而呢個係一個合理的理由去證成其價值<br />\n因為人用鈔票嘅目的都係為咗方便交易，政府的承認能達到這個目的<br />\n<br />\n問題係處女膜的價值由邊個賦予<br />\n更重要的是誰才有資格賦予？<br />\n至少肯定唔係你。你憑咩？<br />\n亦都唔係社會。情侶之間的事，關班花生友撚事？<br />\n<br />\n／點會冇意思？你可以破一個保留咗幾十年嘅處，每一年都係忠貞嘅表現／<br />\n保留處同忠貞無必然關係<br />\n<br />\n處並非忠貞的必要條件<br />\n只要當事人拍拖期間，只與伴侶性交<br />\n關係仍然係單對單<br />\n咪係忠貞（given all other things equal）<br />\n<br />\n處並非忠貞的充分條件<br />\n如果有條女一邊拍拖<br />\n一邊周圍flirt仔<br />\n就算佢一直keep住係處，你都唔會話佢忠貞吧<br />\n<br />\n／你會唔會搵隻雞做你老婆？／<br />\n例子不恰當<br />\n你根本不能從「拒絕選擇性工作者作伴侶」（1）推出『承認破處降低人的價值』（2）<br />\n因為（2）只是（1）的充分卻非必要條件<br />\n你可以用其他理由「拒絕選擇性工作者作伴侶」<br />\n例如『質疑其忠誠度』、『擔心罹患性病』等，這兩個理由均與『承認性經驗降低人的價值』無關<br />\n<br />\n／都只有由自己親手去調教先可能有滿足感<br />\n事實上我更加敢講<br />\n只有屌處女先最開心／<br />\n<br />\n你個人的性癖好，並非必然與其他人相同<br />\n<br />\n／結過婚嘅人扑過好正常<br />\n但拍拖時期就扑咪唔正常囉／<br />\n<br />\n解釋？定係又係你自己覺得？<br />\n<br />\n／但拍拖時期乜都冇已經畀咗個處人<br />\n𠵱啲女就根本娶唔過／<br />\n點解？<br />\n即係選擇同自己鍾意的人做愛反而有問題（假設感情穩定）？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n／只有處先有資格要求處／<br />\n呢點我同意，做人不應搬龍"},{"pid":"8ceb021ecca7e4030133092a4eca61cf8b447ca2","tid":653056,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-04T11:00:53.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"b9233efe586c692bd27b22ec466bd556cecd3832","tid":653056,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-04T11:01:40.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"e87f7ee501820e01c146920032b269c3421e1021","tid":653056,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-04T11:03:44.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"82274d31676ba4727e59ac963db257a594ae1375","tid":653056,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-04T11:05:28.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"536b96626279e52d910a47adea7e16eee69bab7c","tid":653056,"uid":38395,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-05-04T11:11:05.000Z","msg":"認真po無人理"},{"pid":"78000e8c4c0f1ed4f16b344050cb1ae9ce94bb39","tid":653056,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"536b96626279e52d910a47adea7e16eee69bab7c","tid":653056,"uid":38395,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-05-04T11:11:05.000Z","msg":"認真po無人理"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-04T11:13:29.000Z","msg":"sosad<br
