A &pound;48,000 deposit would allow first time buyers to buy a home in 70% of Britain, while a down payment of &pound;11,000 would limit buyers to just 43% of the country.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><strong><ins>Only 28% of millennials believed they would be able to own a property without inheriting cash.</ins></strong></strong><br />\n<br />\nAccording to the research, millennials were also misguided when it came to the timescale of receiving their inheritance.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWhile the average millennial expected to receive their inheritance at the age of 50, one in seven expected to inherit money before the age of 35. But <ins><strong>according to data from the U.K.&rsquo;s Office for National Statistics, peak inheritance age is currently between 55 and 64, while researchers found the average inheritance age for today&rsquo;s millennials was likely to be 61.</strong></ins><br />\n<br />\n<strong><ins>Charles Stanley noted that as Britain&rsquo;s minimum pension age is 55, U.K. millennials relying on their inheritance for a deposit could be retired by the time they purchase their first property.</ins></strong><br />\n<br />\nJohn Porteous, group head of distribution at Charles Stanley, said in a press release Thursday that millennials were taking a &ldquo;risky&rdquo; approach by depending solely on inherited wealth.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;People are living longer than ever, so relying on an inheritance to get on the housing ladder is a risky strategy as you may get less, and much later than planned,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In reality, most people save and invest to get on the housing ladder &mdash; starting early and planning ahead is essential to achieving the deposit you need.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"ad6ad973035551347980fac3faf813bfb3c1a7ef","tid":2172797,"uid":216877,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-25T01:36:45.000Z","msg":"英國遺產稅都貴<br />\n假如香港人賣樓移民過去<br />\n拎住舊錢實會超過遺產稅個免稅額都唔知點避"},{"pid":"37dac2db1353edee50f30ba0198cdf90e1fef025","tid":2172797,"uid":89046,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"ad6ad973035551347980fac3faf813bfb3c1a7ef","tid":2172797,"uid":216877,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-08-25T01:36:45.000Z","msg":"英國遺產稅都貴<br />\n假如香港人賣樓移民過去<br />\n拎住舊錢實會超過遺產稅個免稅額都唔知點避"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-25T02:45:26.000Z","msg":"inheritance tax 40%<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/dust.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n另外gift tax都貴<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8df0664622a4b024f613b551a6cb032b392ac03f","tid":2172797,"uid":89046,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-26T11:24:54.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
