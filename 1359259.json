But since the former British colony was transferred back to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, some gang leaders have tried to assume a veneer of legitimacy through more conventional enterprises like land development.<strong><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\"> And to China&rsquo;s ruling Communist party, they have served as a force that can be leveraged to maintain social order in the rogue territory, and are willing to take on &ldquo;dirty jobs,&rdquo; according to Tit Wing Lo, a professor at the City University of Hong Kong and an expert on triads.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The Communist Party gives them a lot of money and in return they may be asked to maintain stability through what we call extra-legal governance,&rdquo; he tells TIME</span></span></strong>. This, Lo adds, is what may have happened in Yuen Long, a town near the Chinese border where two major triad groups have long held sway. But triad involvement would be hard to legally prove, operating as they do in the shady margins of society.<br />\n<br />\nThe idea that Beijing might rely on vigilantes-for-hire in Hong Kong, which handles its own policing and security affairs, was made explicit in 1993 by then-chief of China&rsquo;s Public Security Ministry Tao Siju. &ldquo;As long as these people are patriotic, as long as they are concerned with Hong Kong&rsquo;s prosperity and stability, we should unite with them,&rdquo; writer and academic Louisa Lim quotes Tao as saying in the New Yorker.<br />\n<br />\nSince then, several attacks on Beijing&rsquo;s opponents in Hong Kong have brought whispers of triad involvement, including the gruesome slashing of former newspaper editor Kevin Lau with a meat cleaver in 2014. Later that same year, a similar attack on pro-democracy demonstrators by pro-Beijing forces was also blamed on triads trying to break up the movement.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: red;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">&ldquo;When people&rsquo;s perception of the police is negative, that&rsquo;s when the triads are brought in,&rdquo; says Lo.</span></span></strong>"},{"pid":"0380f94ca1e571f669a280d8e641d3854889b339","tid":1359259,"uid":36592,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-24T05:52:47.000Z","msg":"同場加映:<br />\n[長文] 因時代周刊直指港府失去管治香港能力嘅分析<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1356861\" target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1356861</a>"},{"pid":"2a13b908806e00a95f376aca4e340cfbd46bc35a","tid":1359259,"uid":36592,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-24T05:53:33.000Z","msg":"相關資料:<br />\n[眾新聞] 警黑勾結呢單嘢玩出火，得罪晒全世界記者，收唔到科<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1353870\" target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1353870</a>"},{"pid":"8e5a467ff3af87cf20b39adaa1e4706c9d54a417","tid":1359259,"uid":36592,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-24T05:54:36.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"color: red;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong>中聯辦成功爭取香港警黑勾結揚威國際</strong></span></span><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4a784d71e21edcb62004e739a8de4a6cf84c812d","tid":1359259,"uid":39752,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-24T05:55:23.000Z","msg":"你哋搞嘅港鐵不合作運動根本錯撚晒<br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1359219\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1359219</a>"},{"pid":"5f50263d9f4038f8bfd0099807103d349bab6f57","tid":1359259,"uid":268957,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-24T05:58:13.000Z","msg":"而家既香港人，根本係用緊亞米巴變型蟲方式去抗共，轉移目標係唔會成功，只會提供更多子彈"},{"pid":"952fc11a8e1cf0d82a7c22ae55099a30903401ea","tid":1359259,"uid":101756,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-24T06:00:06.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
