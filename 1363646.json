The product name is 4006D REACT, a 40mm direct fire round with a velocity of 325 fps (100 m/s) and a max effective range of 120 ft. <br />\n<br />\nWhen asked if American citizens should request the US Government to ban the export of such bullets to HK and China, Corr said, &quot;I thought about it, but there is a danger that if the police had no rubber bullets they might use live rounds. I think it is more effective to boycott China generally until they grant democracy to Hong Kong. We should put Magnitsky sanctions on those individuals in Hong Kong who are responsible for police and Triad violence against peaceful protesters.&quot; <br />\n<br />\nAccording to ALS's PRODUCT DESCRIPTION, &quot;The 4006D REACT is a 40mm direct fire round designed as a blunt trauma pain compliance round. It is highly accurate and effective across a broad range of distances. It is recommended the operator attend an ALS less-lethal instructor training course to better understand product performance and injury potential.&quot; <br />\n<br />\nFB link: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/736732883431145?__tn__=-R\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhongkongbilingualnews%2Fposts%2F736732883431145%3F__tn__%3D-R&d=9aIS%2Fhk2hxf5w8hb7WAMUbBzIjlmttHRdZ2xAWa028c%3D&h=4c7c9033\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/736732883431145?__tn__=-R</a><br />\n<br />\nWeb link: <a href=\"https://www.hongkongbilingualnews.com/post/hong-kong-police-use-florida-co-rubber-bullets-on-protesters-by-chapman-chen-hkbnews\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hongkongbilingualnews.com%2Fpost%2Fhong-kong-police-use-florida-co-rubber-bullets-on-protesters-by-chapman-chen-hkbnews&d=9aIS%2Fhk2hxf5w8hb7WAMUbBzIjlmttHRdZ2xAWa028c%3D&h=54be4814\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.hongkongbilingualnews.com/post/hong-kong-police-use-florida-co-rubber-bullets-on-protesters-by-chapman-chen-hkbnews</a><br />\n<br />\nYellow Chinese caption from FTVV. <br />\n<br />\n#rubberbullet #anderscorr #ALS #ccp #communistchina #florida #maga2020 #extraditionlaw #hongkongresistance #liaisonoffice #lesslethal #Magnitskyact #chapmanchen #keepamericagreat"},{"pid":"1443a5a78805d1c022074d7d2e283d8c23ffb9db","tid":1363646,"uid":54125,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-25T08:30:32.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yipes.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
