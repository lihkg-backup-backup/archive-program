The text could pertain to any case in which states locked down their citizens rather than allow people freedom and permit medical professionals to bear the primary job of disease mitigation. <br />\n<br />\nSo far it has been signed by 435 medical doctors, 1,439 medically trained health professionals, and 9,901 citizens.<br />\n<br />\n信（節錄）<br />\n<br />\n After the initial panic surrounding covid-19, the objective facts now show a completely different picture &ndash; there is no medical justification for any emergency policy anymore.<br />\n<br />\nThe current crisis management has become totally disproportionate and causes more damage than it does any good.<br />\n<br />\nWe call for an end to all measures and ask for an immediate restoration of our normal democratic governance and legal structures and of all our civil liberties.<br />\n<br />\n&lsquo;A cure must not be worse than the problem&rsquo; is a thesis that is more relevant than ever in the current situation. We note, however, that the collateral damage now being caused to the population will have a greater impact in the short and long term on all sections of the population than the number of people now being safeguarded from corona.<br />\n<br />\nIn our opinion, the current corona measures and the strict penalties for non-compliance with them are contrary to the values formulated by the Belgian Supreme Health Council, which, until recently, as the health authority, has always ensured quality medicine in our country: &ldquo;Science &ndash; Expertise &ndash; Quality &ndash; Impartiality &ndash; Independence &ndash; Transparency&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nWe believe that the policy has introduced mandatory measures that are not sufficiently scientifically based, unilaterally directed, and that there is not enough space in the media for an open debate in which different views and opinions are heard. In addition, each municipality and province now has the authorisation to add its own measures, whether well-founded or not.<br />\n<br />\nMoreover, the strict repressive policy on corona strongly contrasts with the government&rsquo;s minimal policy when it comes to disease prevention, strengthening our own immune system through a healthy lifestyle, optimal care with attention for the individual and investment in care personnel.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/medical/no-medical-justification-emergency-measures-open-letter-100s-doctors-health-pros-urges-end\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zerohedge.com%2Fmedical%2Fno-medical-justification-emergency-measures-open-letter-100s-doctors-health-pros-urges-end&d=UZIDdMkqB5nEVwovtN1d9h4DU%2FdTpVEdsDcTgM8IVTs%3D&h=dd4aae87\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zerohedge.com/medical/no-medical-justification-emergency-measures-open-letter-100s-doctors-health-pros-urges-end</a>"},{"pid":"419636347e2829daddd6d567d9dd1b0cfd5ce56c","tid":2214286,"uid":2772,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-23T06:53:42.000Z","msg":"冇人睇醫生邊有生意<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d02ba2a20e9d0dcf16ed9bf8b95b43dd34a83c5b","tid":2214286,"uid":198175,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-09-23T06:54:49.000Z","msg":"唔封城, 照樣行街返工返學, 又唔Q戴口罩, 照去溝女浦吧, 咁即係想點?"},{"pid":"a1c46393344cc7dfc59a6fb04338d78e5556cc14","tid":2214286,"uid":196924,"like":2,"dislike":2,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-09-23T06:57:14.000Z","msg":"死返十億八億White trash<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"24720d5dbe5bef464ec2c4677b935b5c0a5781a0","tid":2214286,"uid":48083,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-23T07:01:13.000Z","msg":"話驗到positive 都不等於受感染<br />\n<br />\nThe test does not measure how many viruses are present in the sample.
