This is a term I invented to describe how the police continue to tackle Patriots who should easily have gotten away.<br />\n<br />\nHow the Compression tactic works:<br />\n<br />\n1) Police are normally at least 100 meters away.  Often more.  Wearing armor and other gear, even masks.<br />\n<br />\n2) They begin a &quot;running of the bulls&quot; as I call it.  The police run as quickly as possible to close the ground and tackle a few.  Police often begin the attack with teargas and/or rubber bullets.<br />\n<br />\n3) Patriots have plenty of time to run...but they get trapped due to streets filled with Patriots.  They cannot runaway fast enough simply due to crowded streets, and often the Patriots behind the front line are not paying attention.  The police need only seconds to close the gap, and the front liners cannot escape.<br />\n<br />\nThis results in a compression of Patriots.  The police simply pick off a few who could not escape.<br />\n<br />\nI was just here and might be in this video.  This is not my video but I saw the entire thing and this is just one of many compressions that happen when police surge during a running of the bulls.<br />\n<br />\nCompression can be mitigated by: spreading out the Patriots so there is plenty of running room.  Using WHISTLES as alerts.  Whistles are one of the oldest battlefield signals for close range.  Very effective.  <br />\n<br />\nWhistles also are good for Si Liu defense when the Lion Birds must defend internally from a crazy ChiNazi with a knife, as recently happened.<br />\n<br />\nWhistles.
