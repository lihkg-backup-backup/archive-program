The event aimed to highlight and identify trends in social apps that would be shaping the next decade of the space.<br />\n<br />\nHuffman&rsquo;s comments critiqued how TikTok tracks the actions of its users. The social media app was a hot topic of discussion throughout the event, and while Lessin asserted that the app had made a number of notable innovations, Huffman was one of the few at the event to offer deep criticisms of the app.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/reddit-ceo-tiktok-is-fundamentally-parasitic/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F02%2F26%2Freddit-ceo-tiktok-is-fundamentally-parasitic%2F&d=2%2B%2BG2pXT7lWIneVuf1o%2BJIDCThP5nbHt%2BrJRLkanJ30%3D&h=912159a3\" target=\"_blank\">https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/reddit-ceo-tiktok-is-fundamentally-parasitic/</a>"},{"pid":"349dcdc82e6e10aacb3b418e7d82f3ed9fc3b5d3","tid":1902397,"uid":222614,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-29T19:40:48.000Z","msg":"reddit 應該將 r/TikTok 鏟起佢 ...."},{"pid":"5621f3605c5bd6bffb5c3918b00d382fa817ec3f","tid":1902397,"uid":222614,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-29T19:41:24.000Z","msg":"reddit should eradicate r/TikTok"},{"pid":"f1bb6e3a8d6c5eb9bddfadf0323446b87656da22","tid":1902397,"uid":14953,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-29T20:12:04.000Z","msg":"TikTok just like a World Drug"}]}
