As the two sides traded unusually intense remarks, Blinken called the cameras back to counter the Chinese officials' comments -- particularly their slights about US democracy -- setting off an unexpected chain of rebuttals as each side responded to the others' remarks.<br />\n<br />\nBlinken had initially said the US intends to defend the &quot;rules-based order&quot; without which there would be a &quot;much more violent world&quot; and said that Chinese activities in places like Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as its cyber attacks on the US and economic coercion of US allies, &quot;threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability. That's why they're not merely internal matters, and why we feel an obligation to raise these issues here today.&quot;"},{"pid":"28b4d7ec7db2639ec25ba934cb64b0d471d08999","tid":2452449,"uid":41404,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-19T00:06:27.000Z","msg":"After Wang finished and aides started to usher cameras out of the room, Blinken interjected, &quot;Hold on one second please.&quot; The top US diplomat motioned for the press to return. &quot;Hold on one second,&quot; he said. &quot;Director, state counselor, given your extended remarks, permit me please to add just a few of my own before we get down to work.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e7d4a1ad7ac8f24f98491422110aaaf37334cf2b","tid":2452449,"uid":127575,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-19T00:09:09.000Z","msg":"左膠：中方講得好<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wail.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c6b2a1fdb12455693e6535d1e10dc2d685fd48b5","tid":2452449,"uid":67468,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-19T00:09:55.000Z","msg":"中國:哦<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wink.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d05c8db008bae4fdfed923a25c8cceb411156e4b","tid":2452449,"uid":312598,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-19T00:18:15.000Z","msg":"大家做吓樣啫<br />\n唔洗咁認真"},{"pid":"d24e597242c967bdd65cca667c9ba7a7a3d40fe0","tid":2452449,"uid":70238,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"d05c8db008bae4fdfed923a25c8cceb411156e4b","tid":2452449,"uid":312598,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2021-03-19T00:18:15.000Z","msg":"大家做吓樣啫<br />\n唔洗咁認真"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-19T00:22:39.000Z","msg":"終国口交部vs美國口交部。<br />\nATNA 典範。仲要開兩日，交足戲。"},{"pid":"cfe29d862609ffc4dad0a86b173ab0a0b5249199","tid":2452449,"uid":247845,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-03-19T00:27:24.000Z","msg":"關注"}]}
