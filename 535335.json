Many of the &lsquo;new Hong Kongers&rsquo; form part of a generation that have only known Chinese rule, yet feel deeply alienated from it, seeing it as a threat to their way of life.<br />\n<br />\nPopulist political currents have emerged within this cultural and societal context. Advocating independence of Hong Kong as a city-state, they are fiercely hostile to what they call the &lsquo;mainlandization&rsquo; of the polity, and have promoted anti-migrant discourses and direct actions that have led to accusations of xenophobia.<br />\n<br />\nDrawing on unstructured, in-depth interviews with participants in the Umbrella Movement, who had varying levels of activity and diverse political affiliations, this paper explores these developments through a revised conception of Benedict Anderson&rsquo;s theory of the imagined community. The chapter argues that this deeply alienated ideological form of &lsquo;localist&rsquo; has been constituted geopolitically by the nature of Hong Kong&rsquo;s combined development with the Chinese Mainland.//<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/human-rights-development-and-global-justice-series-tickets-41941960533\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eventbrite.co.uk%2Fe%2Fhuman-rights-development-and-global-justice-series-tickets-41941960533&d=dQqPzvoHOUZC4X%2B5LzeEsrZGMQxn7aheim1dKZ3ASAU%3D&h=f53d1b80\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/human-rights-development-and-global-justice-series-tickets-41941960533</a>"},{"pid":"8fbd23f84b76056257c2d2cb43e104579189a35c","tid":535335,"uid":132859,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-20T17:50:38.000Z","msg":"香港獨立係decolonisation，係將香港依嗰potential nationalism帶去其終極目的(建立nation state)嘅必然一步<br />\n以前西媒話係xenophobic真係笑死人<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
