I&rsquo;m their daughter and they love me so much, and they don&rsquo;t want anything to happen to me. But we are students and we&rsquo;re the ones who will own this place in the future. Yes I&rsquo;m only a teenager, and I&rsquo;m still growing, and I&rsquo;m still learning more. But I can speak while I&rsquo;m learning more. And I know right from wrong. Our freedoms are disappearing, and I don&rsquo;t want to live in a place where I can&rsquo;t speak freely about my opinion. It&rsquo;s so important to hear everyone&rsquo;s opinion. When you only look at something from one angle&mdash;it may seem perfect. But there might be problems that you can only see from another angle. So everyone must be free to share their angle, or things will get worse. Some people think that protesting is pointless. Yes China is very powerful, but everything is possible because we are fighting for the right thing. And truth will always win. Even if it takes one hundred years. I&rsquo;m still too young to stand on the front line, but one day I will stand up and tell the whole world that we in Hong Kong are not afraid, and that we will not hide or escape, and that we&rsquo;ll always fight for freedom.&rdquo;<br />\n已經有9萬幾個like喇 <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7565f4fef9938895781c9d5a0d6ad04cd2f5cc49","tid":1681765,"uid":47605,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-29T15:40:35.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><img src=\"https://na.cx/i/7xTYJ2h.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2F7xTYJ2h.jpg&h=cd8db3a4&s={SIZE}\" /></blockquote>"},{"pid":"efd8f747b217670b9fe1e36fbdfd9f6b670851b8","tid":1681765,"uid":14897,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-29T16:01:43.000Z","msg":"推<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n氣牆勁"},{"pid":"981f6939c2de59f71a7357fa966a8851cb666f26","tid":1681765,"uid":78392,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-29T16:04:35.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/argue.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/argue.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/argue.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"647d1db0e6fdd0aa55b5c2820b3ca2ab677b2ce3","tid":1681765,"uid":268160,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-29T16:04:48.000Z","msg":"Tui"}]}
