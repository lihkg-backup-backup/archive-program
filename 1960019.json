The zoo says that Nadia along with her sister Azul, plus two Amur tigers, and three African lions had &quot;developed a dry cough and all are expected to recover.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe tiger's positive COVID-19 test was confirmed by USDA&rsquo;s National Veterinary Services Laboratory, based in Ames, Iowa, the zoo says.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world&rsquo;s continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,&quot; the zoo said in its news release. &quot;Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers. It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe four affected tigers live in the zoo&rsquo;s Tiger Mountain exhibit.<br />\n<br />\nThe zoo stressed that there is &quot;no evidence that any person has been infected with COVID-19 in the U.S. by animals, including by pet dogs or cats.&quot; <br />\n<br />\nThe conservation society's four zoos and its aquarium have been temporarily closed since March 16 due to the pandemic."}]}
