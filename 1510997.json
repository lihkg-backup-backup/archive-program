/>\n前晚黑衫示威者途經新城市廣場受到市民熱烈歡迎，打碎咗一眾藍絲同內地網民嘅玻璃心。<br />\n<br />\n特首林鄭呢排係咁話要搞對話平台，但其實民意真係唔難睇到，只要落下區就會感受到，好似前晚網上流傳一條片，幾十個應該係由荃灣搭港鐵返到沙田嘅黑衫人，經過新城市廣場時受到市民英雄式嘅歡迎，周圍嘅街坊歡呼拍掌嘅聲音幾乎無停過，不過呢條片打碎一眾藍絲同大陸憤青網民嘅玻璃心，完全接受唔到佢哋日鬧夜鬧黑衫人，原來先係受市民支持。<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://static.appledaily.hk/images/apple-photos/apple/20190827/large/1566838881_b414.jpg\"

/>\n呢條片入面，班戴晒頭盔面罩豬嘴、政府同警察口中嘅「暴徒」，返到佢哋自己屬於嘅社區，本來喺新城市廣場嘅一班街坊，即刻好似分紅海咁讓出一條路，幾十個黑衣人係中間穿過，被現場過百街坊夾道歡迎，不斷歡呼拍掌，仲一齊叫「光復香港，時代革命」口號。<br />\n<br />\n呢條片亦立即在網上瘋傳，對於一班日鬧夜鬧黑衫人係「暴徒」嘅藍絲，呢個打擊可謂十分大，有藍絲完全難以相信，喺fb留言問佢係咪生活喺平行世界？呢條片又俾人傳返大陸，成班大陸憤青網民嘅玻璃心即時碎晒，有人不滿大陸人日撐夜撐差人對付「暴徒」，點解香港市民反而支持「暴徒」？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n西環出面 林鄭閉門晤青年<br />\n<br />\n其實講到尾，呢一切咪又係北京、港府控制輿論，唔講事實全部，以為可以自欺欺人嘅結果！好似林鄭要搞對話平台，佢點搞呢？原來又係由西環出手，搵班自己友匿埋傾偈當對咗話，好似噚日佢由西環出面，聯絡國際青年商會香港總會、傑出青年協會，以及香港遊樂場協會呢啲友好組織，搵班年輕人對話，佢哋不單閉門，仲要有大大個西環官員坐喺度，你估有人敢講真話咩？而林鄭照舊乜都話唔做得，但就特別提到開學後要盡力保護警察子女，仲話最近正在「做校長的工作」，叫校長要掌握教師政治立場。<br
