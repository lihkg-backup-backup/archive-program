Getting access to its fleshy, odorous insides, however, remained an enigma to the &ldquo;foreigner friend&rdquo;, even after steps were taken to remove the thorny shell. It all made sense after photos were taken&mdash; his &ldquo;friend&rdquo; had simply shaved off the thorns instead of actually hacking into the husk.<br />\n<img src=\"https://img.eservice-hk.net/upload/2018/08/01/195222_b0c959c60456bdc72cb145e101c0ed5b.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.eservice-hk.net%2Fupload%2F2018%2F08%2F01%2F195222_b0c959c60456bdc72cb145e101c0ed5b.png&h=15804a10&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nOf course, Tan might have crafted a tall story for the lulz and the viral clicks, and we guess he succeeded in getting thousands of likes and shares. The true source of the shaven-smooth durian is unknown, but the images appeared on the Facebook page of Malaysian radio station Sinar FM back on July 14.<br />\n<img src=\"https://img.eservice-hk.net/upload/2018/08/01/195309_696649b8f62080ac16e484caa451e71f.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.eservice-hk.net%2Fupload%2F2018%2F08%2F01%2F195309_696649b8f62080ac16e484caa451e71f.png&h=ba233537&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nWhile the dream of naturally thornless durians (who hasn&rsquo;t had their legs pricked when carrying a plastic bag full of the thorny things?) remains a fantasy, one could always purchase these gigantic ones with their thorns carved out in Thailand by Por Pala-U Farm in the beach town of Hua Hin.<br />\n<br />\nOver in Davao, Philippines, there&rsquo;s a version of durian with nubby skin in lieu of thorns &mdash; a genetic mutation, according to the Year of the Durian blog."},{"pid":"14fc87d078cf18d818796deb8f4aff38a38168e5","tid":760946,"uid":175783,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-08-01T16:11:46.000Z","msg":"俾人踢爆即潛<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
