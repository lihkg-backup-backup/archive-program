In the course of these movements, the government keeps turning a deaf ear to the five demands arrogantly, and hiding behind the evilized, overpowered police force. The incapability of government has made the whole society dichotomous with social unrest, leading to mutual distrust between citizens and the police force.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Fitch Rating, Hong Kong&rsquo;s creditability has been expected to be lower med not due to consecutive protests, but because the distrust towards the Hong Kong government. Our government conspires with the police to exercise totalitarianism to rule over the society violently, jeopardizing our status as the international financial center. We, as bankers/financial workers, have the responsibility to bring law and order out of chaos in order to restore the economical prospect of Hong Kong. <br />\n<br />\nIn addition to the possible chaotic traffic and risk of workers&rsquo; safety on the day of work strike, We are here to sincerely and earnestly request your agreement to designate 5th August 2019 as a day to execute &ldquo;work from home&rdquo; policy. We promise to pay extra effort on our job duties and minimize the effect on our project deadlines. We hope that you will approve our request and spread the message of &ldquo;notice of no objection&rdquo; in the intranet in showing support to Hong Kong. <br />\n<br />\nLastly, we are here to reaffirm the five demands to our Government:<br />\n1. Implement the Dual Universal Suffrage<br />\n2. Withdraw the Extradition Bill completely<br />\n3. Release all Arrested Protesters unconditionally<br />\n4. Retract the characterization of &ldquo;riot&rdquo; of the June 12 protests<br />\n5. Set up an Independent Commission of Inquiry into police behaviour<br />\n<br />\nYours sincerely,"}]}
