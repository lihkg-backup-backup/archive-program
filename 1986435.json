Populations like the one in Hong Kong could disappear within a generation."},{"pid":"4fa0a4d0577024e3915c3e9ba58645381a156d92","tid":1986435,"uid":143499,"like":2,"dislike":2,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-24T01:19:40.000Z","msg":"半年幾千人失蹤死咗你唔去理， 海豚嘅priority會唔會高過人類呀<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"786c5ee85f70d2c12477e86285cb46a8b59fe181","tid":1986435,"uid":12599,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"3f9de28ab23af13aeabd67b46d7b886fd3bdf6b9","tid":1986435,"uid":204539,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-04-24T01:18:09.000Z","msg":"又唔見啲保育團體做嘢架喎<br />\n白海豚無保育價值咩<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/upset.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-24T01:21:42.000Z","msg":"起橋，起東大嶼有錢收，保育海豚無錢收<br />\n<br />\n梗係揀人仔"},{"pid":"f4e47e6908276d2ee80a42990901ce2477980f8d","tid":1986435,"uid":254594,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-24T01:22:26.000Z","msg":"比支那用哂黎入藥"},{"pid":"9c9522155ae04eefbfbb0e73fb3661905a561296","tid":1986435,"uid":97080,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-24T01:24:19.000Z","msg":"大橋<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
