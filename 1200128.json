The law is clearly a breach of Hong Kong&rsquo;s human right, as it allows fugitives to be handed to mainland China. Hong Kong People&rsquo;s freedom to speech and freedom to assembly have inevitably been curtailed by the law.<br />\n<br />\nWe urge you to enforce the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and impose sanction on xxxxx, freeze his/ her ( as well as his/ her spouse yyyyyyy and children zzzzzzz&rsquo;s )assets, and ban his / her and his / her family members from entering the U.S.<br />\n<br />\nWe sincerely hope that you could help sanction xxxxxxxxx, whose support of the extradition law has definitely led to much worsened human rights in Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nYours faithfully,<br />\nChris Wong<br />\n（on behalf of Hong Kong citizens)"},{"pid":"e9767c27ca25fa04ecf9dd88624a931cf8146f5b","tid":1200128,"uid":248235,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-10T16:33:56.000Z","msg":"PUSH"}]}
