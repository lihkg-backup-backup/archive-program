app.<br />\n<br />\nApple said in a statement that &ldquo;many concerned customers in Hong Kong&rdquo; contacted the company about the mapping app. Apple said it immediately began investigating the app&rsquo;s use and found it &ldquo;has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,&rdquo; the statement said.<br />\n<br />\nApple did not comment beyond its statement, and the app&rsquo;s developer did not immediately have a comment on the removal.<br />\n<br />\nUnder Apple&rsquo;s rules and policies, apps that meet its standards to appear in the App Store have sometimes been removed after their release if they were found to facilitate illegal activity or threaten public safety.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2011, Apple modified its app store to remove apps that listed locations for drunken driving checkpoints not previously published by law enforcement officials.<br />\n<br />\nAsked for comment after the People&rsquo;s Daily piece was published, HKmap.live&rsquo;s developer, who has not revealed his or her identity, said the app merely consolidated information that was available in the public domain, such as groups on Telegram, another service protestors were using to communicate.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Protest is part of our freedom of speach (sic) and I don&rsquo;t think the application is illegal in HK,&rdquo;

Regardless I would like to criticism it as an logical fallacy (Slippery Slope) where there is no direct reflection. Since I do not seen any court ruling which proven your statement above. I strongly complain your injustice decision against HKmap which is  prejudice and unacceptable.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough I agree with you that we can ignore the fact that most protesters using the app just to prevent personal harm from police outraged force ambushed (Since police safety should always higher than protesters), your assumption of the usage is also prejudice. As a pro-government Hong Kong citizens, HKmap is very useful for me to locate police force so that me and my mainland China friends can go to the street to show our support to the policemen and prevent them being targeted and ambushed by those cockroach. Therefore I think your removal of HKmap is somehow an endangered movement to our Hong Kong society.<br />\n<br />\nLastly, I have learned from the Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that many criminals use Facebook and Instagram in low-breaking such as e-Shopping fraud and social media deception. I strongly suggest that you should also remove those American-made app which so led to serious harm to Hong Kong citizens, otherwise it will show the world that Apple is an injustice and biased company, which is seriously harming 1.4 billion Chinese.<br />\n<br />\nTherefore, I demand:<br />\n1. An official reply of my complaints within 72 hours.<br />\n2. Let HKmap即時地圖 shelf again on App Store.<br />\n3. An official apology for your injustice, prejudice decision.<br />\n4. Six Demands, Not on less!"},{"pid":"da6527876059cd0be294cb00e2c2622d78807c81","tid":1643217,"uid":10552,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-10T16:11:54.000Z","msg":"中文版：<br />\n<br />\n主題：在HKmap被下架一事作出投訴<br />\n<br />\n親愛的蘋果公司：<br />\n<br />\n本人現正對貴 公司於十月九日將「HKmap即時地圖」（該程式）下架作出嚴正投訴。<br />\n<br />\n你在聲明中指出，該程式透過披露警方位置影響公聚安全。先不論這陳述應否作為滑坡謬誤的一例子，本人直至今天（十月十日台灣國慶）從未於任何法庭裁決引證到有一小撮激進暴力示威者以此功能伏擊警察。因此我認為你對該程式的指控是不公及不合理的。<br />\n<br />\n雖然如此，我認同貴 公司認為警察的人生安全高於示威者。但我認為你對廣大的iOS用戶對該程式的用途亦不盡理解。由該程式上架至今，我和我的國內同胞一直依賴該程式尋找出勤中的警察，並帶同金錢及食物對他們作出慰問及保護他們免受暴徒襲擊。因此，我認為你們的下架行為是好心做壞事，反而大大影響了廣大香港市民的安全。<br />\n<br />\n最後，我亦從網絡安全及科技罪案部網頁得知有大量騙徒透過應用程式如Facebook、Instagram等進行如網上購物騙案和網上交友陷阱。在一視同人的原則下，我認為貴 公司亦應將那些美國製應用程式下架，回復香港社會和平，否則會向世人揭露貴 公司不公、偏頗的真面目，及嚴重傷害14億中國人民感情！<br />\n<br />\n我要求：<br />\n1. 貴 公司在七十二小時內回覆我的投訴。<br />\n2. 將HKmap重新上架。<br />\n3. 貴 公司就此事作出正式道歉。<br />\n4. 六大訴求，缺一不可。<br />\n<br />\n完。"},{"pid":"14e71470d2982e01b1c39a52adace7718096e1bf","tid":1643217,"uid":23169,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-11T03:08:12.000Z","msg":"Tim Cook just adds fuel to the fire.
