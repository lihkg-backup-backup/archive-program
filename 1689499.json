Across the board, they see anyone who is a protester as less than human. This is key, as CCP is queuing them up to kill Hong Kong people. This is not a matter of if, but when. <br />\nThe messages they want to send to Hong Kongers are,<br />\na) Being anywhere on the street near a protester is illegal and will be met with violence. <br />\nb) Being anywhere near the police is illegal and will be met with violence. <br />\nPolice aren&rsquo;t interested in taking people to court or charging them. This is State terrorism, pure and simple. <br />\nCitizens can only avoid violence by staying home. And by home that means, your apartment. Residential complexes and public spaces can become no-go areas if the police deem them to be. <br />\nThis is now an epic power struggle between a violent armed State and a united, but unarmed populace. <br />\nPeking sees that HK is no longer a global news story. HK can no longer grab the world headlines with million man marches, because the police have made it too dangerous for most people to go out and amass. The international media is only interested if there is a) a solution b) the PLA come. c) a massacre. CCP is trying to play this global media apathy to their advantage. This is a deliberate and calculating tactic by Peking to break the deadlock and come out as winners over a broken city - no concessions, no solutions, no mass marches, bcus violence is too high, no PLA, bcus HK police will gladly terrorise citizens day after day. <br />\nPeople I meet keep asking me, what is the end game? <br />\nThe answer is as simple as it is epic. The end of the CCP. <br />\nHong Kongers have awakened the world to the malign intent of a China led by CCP. Hong Kongers are paying the price in tears and blood for 30 years of global appeasement of this terrible regime. <br />\nWho can tell when the end will come, but we are the beginning of the end for CCP. <br />\nHong Kongers will keep fighting for their city, and in doing so they are actually changing the world.</blockquote>"},{"pid":"bc264193d14afb85b9fb2fd329d957e7ac19a36c","tid":1689499,"uid":282569,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T23:35:29.000Z","msg":"佢深入淺出咁推廣 #全球抗共 比英文讀者<br />\n<br />\n又 佢講到咁明 外國媒體嘅旁觀心態 無論對外國人士 定香港抗爭者 都係好事"},{"pid":"8b5849f973c63a300e12d8c99411d57fccb343d1","tid":1689499,"uid":41545,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T23:36:14.000Z","msg":"問題係點拖死中共<br />\n要斷晒佢資金流入？"},{"pid":"d424a98898ee05683f7fbd0c793418e033770133","tid":1689499,"uid":289751,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T23:36:27.000Z","msg":"CCP想拖死個運動<br />\n完。<br />\n宜家係賭CCP支爆先定香港人死哂先。"},{"pid":"e2656029632b521d1b99b953a560889009f651a3","tid":1689499,"uid":289751,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"8b5849f973c63a300e12d8c99411d57fccb343d1","tid":1689499,"uid":41545,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T23:36:14.000Z","msg":"問題係點拖死中共<br />\n要斷晒佢資金流入？"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T23:37:52.000Z","msg":"外資撤緊.<br />\n比唔到中資上市, 阿里爸爸今個月上市"},{"pid":"e06cbb26ee5feb58ddfbd513480cbe66535a7747","tid":1689499,"uid":322732,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T23:50:58.000Z","msg":"有冇可能全球罷買中資<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"41eeb8e9e4b90a4e29f7b8c700b40c470c295ccf","tid":1689499,"uid":273319,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"bc264193d14afb85b9fb2fd329d957e7ac19a36c","tid":1689499,"uid":282569,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T23:35:29.000Z","msg":"佢深入淺出咁推廣 #全球抗共 比英文讀者<br />\n<br />\n又 佢講到咁明 外國媒體嘅旁觀心態 無論對外國人士 定香港抗爭者 都係好事"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-03T00:02:18.000Z","msg":"有感<br />\n大大力刮咗一巴<br />\n刮落一啲話要和平畀外國睇嘅人度<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/whip.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8a70fc011e225a2a82d697d156d2b4987055d698","tid":1689499,"uid":273319,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"8b5849f973c63a300e12d8c99411d57fccb343d1","tid":1689499,"uid":41545,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T23:36:14.000Z","msg":"問題係點拖死中共<br />\n要斷晒佢資金流入？"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-03T00:07:03.000Z","msg":"繼續製造混亂<br />\n一方面消耗軍費<br />\n另一方面趕走外資<br />\n<br />\n利申9up"},{"pid":"b56ccbd630bdeb2de50b6bfdfb58847dbc8a0a35","tid":1689499,"uid":325772,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-03T00:12:20.000Z","msg":"估唔到外國人都見到頭2點"},{"pid":"eaea4cdd92609be4e9c1bf7a06bf818017e9fc06","tid":1689499,"uid":53577,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-03T00:12:52.000Z","msg":"佢比99%香港人還清楚而家情況!<br />\n<br />\n勇武要認真讀下佢講啲乜,<br />\n<br />\n和理非等死都得, 集中營一定有你哋份.<br />\n<br />\n至於要返工嘅賤種, 繼續做你哋嘅賤種."},{"pid":"0c028dffdd8cc3cdc97da50285b1e1c52e5afd15","tid":1689499,"uid":282569,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"41eeb8e9e4b90a4e29f7b8c700b40c470c295ccf","tid":1689499,"uid":273319,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"bc264193d14afb85b9fb2fd329d957e7ac19a36c","tid":1689499,"uid":282569,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T23:35:29.000Z","msg":"佢深入淺出咁推廣 #全球抗共 比英文讀者<br />\n<br />\n又 佢講到咁明 外國媒體嘅旁觀心態 無論對外國人士 定香港抗爭者 都係好事"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-03T00:02:18.000Z","msg":"有感<br />\n大大力刮咗一巴<br />\n刮落一啲話要和平畀外國睇嘅人度<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/whip.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-03T00:13:49.000Z","msg":"咪就撚係<br />\n成日用和平做旗號 話為咗要打國輿論戰<br />\n根本個輿輪lead/拖住<br />\n佢而家畫公仔畫出腸 係睇警暴唔過眼之餘 真係企喺幫手點醒盲從示威者角度出發"},{"pid":"bf9cc530b4b87691be37568d5d9b9e50c36bdcca","tid":1689499,"uid":176313,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-03T00:14:15.000Z","msg":"做嘢先會死架&hellip;"},{"pid":"f839a53fcc1790a562f26193f5873a62f4014598","tid":1689499,"uid":282569,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"8b5849f973c63a300e12d8c99411d57fccb343d1","tid":1689499,"uid":41545,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2019-11-02T23:36:14.000Z","msg":"問題係點拖死中共<br />\n要斷晒佢資金流入？"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-03T00:17:00.000Z","msg":"全球聯手抗共、打壓中共<br />\n好似好虛 但真係引發支爆唯ㄧ途徑<br />\n亦係香港唯ㄧ生路"},{"pid":"a90995d6923e3f8c678160c3493be9ae7a391030","tid":1689499,"uid":273319,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-03T00:26:47.000Z","msg":"可能要對外國人做多啲民生層面嘅文宣<br />\n提供一啲支援香港嘅實際行動<br />\n<br />\n舉個例<br />\n呼籲罷用華為，因為佢會偷你啲個人資料"}]}
