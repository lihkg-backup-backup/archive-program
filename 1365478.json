Fulham&rsquo;s spending destabilized the club, but Aston Villa&rsquo;s spending is partly to keep their squad stable.<br />\n<br />\nA huge part of Aston Villa&rsquo;s success last season was their midfield trio of Jack Grealish, John McGinn and Conor Hourihane, so unsurprisingly Dean Smith hasn&rsquo;t overhauled his central midfield.<br />\n<br />\nVilla&rsquo;s loan signings were also vital in helping them earn promotion from the Championship. Yannick Bolasie for the first half of the season and Anwar El Ghazi for the second half helped create the opportunities for Tammy Abraham to score 25 goals last season. At the back, Axel Tuanzebe and Tyrone Mings provided a reasonably solid central defensive partnership (although Villa shipped a lot more goals than many of their promotion rivals.)<br />\n<br />\nAston Villa made the transfers of Mings and El Ghazi permanent this summer, but Abraham has returned to Chelsea and Tuanzebe to Manchester United.
