Most of the people who protested against the tightening of authoritarianism are very serious.<br />\n<br />\nAt the same time, the authority most prefers to use DIVIDE AND CONQUER to divide our land, and then defeat them one by one.<br />\n<br />\nIf we can learn from history, we can see that the government, as an army of violence, is an army of fear of thought, that is, our land! So the government always thinks about the division of our land, and we know that our land must be united!<br />\n<br />\nHe is most interested in manipulating the media, and getting our hands and feet into trouble with reporters, causing him to make wrong decisions and split and divide the people who originally followed him. But we must know that our struggle is against tyranny, and our beliefs and determination will not be affected by other factors different from our way of thinking. Therefore, we must get rid of any situation that causes divergence of public opinion.<br />\nIn order to maintain unity, we must believe that history is what we need. We should not judge people in protest, but in pursuit of goals.<br />\nThe method of unity is not important, but we must unite to oppose tyranny and safeguard human rights.<br />\nCome on!"},{"pid":"560a801031bf8d4db7b76c21e03d2aa83ba1c890","tid":2203506,"uid":274532,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-15T11:17:10.000Z","msg":"<img
