President Trump has been thoroughly scolded for calling the virus from China the &ldquo;Chinese virus&rdquo; &mdash; don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s be beastly to the ChiComs &mdash; but the culpability of the Chinese government in the disaster that is playing out around the world is discussed, if it is discussed at all, in the most muffled way. There is a long history of attaching geographic names to diseases. If the present instances are unfair to the Chinese people, who have suffered massively from the outbreak, a better name would be &ldquo;Xi&rsquo;s disease<br />\n<br />\nIndeed, we do not blame the Chinese people for the fact that a novel coronavirus cropped up in Wuhan. We blame the government in Beijing for making the problem dramatically worse by trying to cover it up, for its ridiculous efforts to try to shift blame for the epidemic onto the United States and others, and for its ongoing attempts to veil its own shameful incompetence by expelling journalists from the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal.<br />\n<br />\nBeijing&rsquo;s vanity &mdash; and its insecurity &mdash; gave the coronavirus &ldquo;a critical monthlong head start,&rdquo; as James Palmer put it in Foreign Policy. The Communist Party machine that rules 1.4 billion people in China may look like an immovable monolith, but it has weaknesses and fissures. The Chinese people at large may not feel much sympathy for the despised Uighur minority, but they know that if the Uighurs can be rounded up and put in concentration camps, then so can they. They have watched as the government of Xi Jinping has violated the terms of the settlement under which, in theory, Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy a high degree of autonomy and self-rule. They have seen the brutal suppression of dissidents at home and Beijing&rsquo;s attempts, too often successful, to bully its neighbors and trading partners. They know firsthand the bottomless corruption of the Chinese ruling elite. And they have, for a generation, accepted that corruption and repression in exchange for security and a rising standard of material life. The rulers in Beijing know that they are always one serious recession away from being turned out &mdash; and worse &mdash; and they so feared economic disruption and damage to their own institutional prestige that they placed a losing bet that the heavy hand of their police state would be heavy enough to quash the coronavirus outbreak.<br />\n<br />\nWe are all now paying a price for that corruption and stupidity.<br />\n<br />\nA new disease can crop up anywhere. We do not blame Beijing for that. We blame Beijing for the other Chinese virus: the repression it practices at home and seeks to export, and its criminal negligence in this epidemic.<br />\n<br />\n...<br />\n<br />\nThe Beijing regime has long been a boot on the neck of the Chinese people, but it is now a menace to the world at large. There are many things that we hope will change in the wake of this crisis. The character of the government in Beijing should be one of them.<br />\n<br />\n佢地從來無支持過侵侵 好憎侵侵<br />\n<br />\n但今次屌支支共屌到泊泊聲<br />\n<br />\n佢講到中國人亦有中國人的問顯<br />\n容許個咁撚腐敗同壓迫既政權出現<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n世界轉向了"},{"pid":"5efa9780ca0d00f4718c92f8e9ed225850b5f5d2","tid":1933479,"uid":193217,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T10:09:28.000Z","msg":"唔好睇輕呢段野<br />\n佢表達既唔係個人意見<br />\n而係陣型 美國保守派既陣型<br />\n美國人今次真係嬲撚到仆街"},{"pid":"a5ac4f43ac9c66cfbc9eb31d45339f587b619c11","tid":1933479,"uid":193217,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T10:12:01.000Z","msg":"國家評論是美國的一份半月刊雜誌，由作家小威廉&middot;F&middot;巴克利創建於1955年。該雜誌出版紙本的同時也可以在線訂閱，但網站上的免費內容和雜誌內容迥然不同。雜誌的在線版本National Review Online形容自己是「美國最大且最受歡迎的保守派新聞、評論和觀點」<br />\n<br />\n美國開始團結<br />\n憎侵侵果班都轉晒方向"},{"pid":"9c5b932c7f2cb3e50856e6b48bce15c890930c47","tid":1933479,"uid":2197,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T10:12:42.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"82ae73294addd3a828f935231ef6c9adf2f95225","tid":1933479,"uid":3513,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T10:13:05.000Z","msg":"皮已正 但好多白左仲懵懵下"},{"pid":"9434b1c9b0bdc1a0e1e6bff43174ba9633069c95","tid":1933479,"uid":3513,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"9c5b932c7f2cb3e50856e6b48bce15c890930c47","tid":1933479,"uid":2197,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T10:12:42.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T10:13:26.000Z","msg":"中左底線啦.... 玩撚大左"},{"pid":"2b6ccad976f9c333d603510bc65ab5e864e7ea4f","tid":1933479,"uid":167548,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T10:13:42.000Z","msg":"支支想玩污名化美軍, 玩出禍<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"dd5ef68a4efe9d367959dd09f5e0a50ea945496c","tid":1933479,"uid":49575,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T10:14:07.000Z","msg":"本來都無咩野 多得中共式火水救火"},{"pid":"fe81e2e28346924fcc322102f30eafcd5a9317f6","tid":1933479,"uid":167548,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T10:14:49.000Z","msg":"利申聽啲藍屍信隻病毒是USA-originated <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/haha.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1af781ca20131fdb1c59da62d3f697f2cbece69a","tid":1933479,"uid":193217,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T10:20:27.000Z","msg":"The Beijing regime has long been a boot on the neck of the Chinese people, but it is now a menace to the world at large.
