And so linear is concave, now the upper level set of U are convex, U is a concave function, we know that concave function has lower level set, BC is convex, we know that convex function has lower level set, so the upper level set of U are convex, the lower level set of Budget Constrain are convex, so in that case, it is pretty clear that we have a maximum.<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\nA lower level set is convex, U function is concave, so the upper level set is convex. Because of the convexity of upper level set and the convexity of lower level set, if we find the point which the slopes are the same, it's gonna be a max, it's the highest level curve we can get. So what we need for a maximum is not the u be concave and the constrain is convex, what we really need is the upper level set of U is convex and the lower level set of the constrain convex. You dont need the U functions be concave and the constrain convex , you just need the upper level set of U be convex and lower level set of constrain be convex."},{"pid":"219070c777f80fbc835371877f68b24c1cab0af4","tid":270398,"uid":36383,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T11:01:17.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ea019a6fe9895df4ed94b2a0f4f62bc035c3d1b5","tid":270398,"uid":38778,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T11:03:18.000Z","msg":"In Economics We trust.<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"700b62ad9f3bd39328c8d1f554a050036a41d5ae","tid":270398,"uid":90845,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T13:44:58.000Z","msg":"小心啲 U concave 和 quasi-concave的分別喎。"},{"pid":"ddcf4d9312d94c8b57888d27593ac59bea0f4ebe","tid":270398,"uid":44073,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T14:03:08.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"7a7a48bcb89afc480f809db1e97e394c5bbba371","tid":270398,"uid":54930,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T15:41:45.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>小心啲 U concave 和 quasi-concave的分別喎。</blockquote><br />\n點分<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"79b0e02ce63eab7bbf817616c9c08b3a589b06e1","tid":270398,"uid":44073,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T16:26:01.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"}]}
