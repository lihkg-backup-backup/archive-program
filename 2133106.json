In accordance with animal law in Japan, if your pet is a social animal, you must have at least two of them living together. Most citizens honor it. According to the veterinarians, you should clip your bunny's nails every month. Rabbits are compatible with most other pets if you teach the other pets well. At Tokyo University, researchers conducted an experiment last year and this morning where they showed they could bond a <span class=\"gold\">rabbit</span> with a <span class=\"gold\">dog</span> in a short period of time. They were happy to find their results were compatible with the results of the study undertaken last year. Hereafter, Joe had his bunnies and Akita living together. He believes he'll continue luving with them in the hereafter. You can take the House Rabbit Journals for free and read them at your leisure. Joe speaks five languages fluently. He told me 'Because it has a jargonistic tone, instead of writing &quot;as per our previous conversation&quot;, we can simply write &quot;as we discussed&quot; or &quot;as discussed&quot;. Instead of writing &quot;as per your request&quot;, we can just write &quot;as you requested&quot;. Instead of saying &quot;as per our agreement&quot;, we can simlly say &quot;as we agreed&quot;. Rather than say &quot;please find attached the receipt&quot;, we can just say &quot;attached is the receipt&quot; or &quot;enclosed is the receipt&quot; or &quot;I've attached the receipt&quot; or &quot;I've enclosed the receipt&quot;. Rather than say &quot;I enclose herewith two documents&quot;, it's more natural to say &quot;enclosed are two documents&quot; or &quot;attached are two documents or I've attached two documents&quot; or &quot;I've enclosed two documents&quot;. Instead of saying &quot;here is the report for your perusal&quot;, it's more natural to say &quot;here is the report for your review&quot;. Instead of saying &quot;please return the form at your earliest convenience&quot;, we can say &quot;please return the form by next Friday&quot;.'"},{"pid":"bf9385155e8c26ec8c13bf14a217067e3581a7bd","tid":2133106,"uid":321976,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"d9fc37c1efc80bce53f290ce39bcea80dbbe98cf","tid":2133106,"uid":27025,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-07-31T00:04:31.000Z","msg":"話說前幾日領養左隻唐狗女<br />\n6個月大，佢都幾乖<br />\n不過佢係屋企唔肯去廁所，尤其係大便<br />\n呢排好似都會打風落雨<br />\n出唔到街，擔心佢會死忍<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-31T09:19:23.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/if7a3AZ.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2Fif7a3AZ.jpg&h=a6039630&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n可以參考吓。"}]}
