President Trump had a meeting with Xi Jinping at the G20 and he seemed to make a concession by no longer banning American companies from selling goods to Chinese tech firm Huawei, which the U.S. has said is a national security threat and could be used to spy. So, is the president taking them off the blacklist something he should be doing?<br />\n<br />\nSEN. GRAHAM: <strong>Well it's a lot of leverage because Huawei is a huge Chinese company, and it really is owned by the Chinese government, it's not a private sector company as we would know it.</strong> Microsoft came into my office trying to make sure that they could sell some technology to China that would not compromise our national security. So I don't know what he agreed to regarding exceptions to the ban. <strong>If they're minor exceptions, that's okay, but if we're selling Huawei major technology, that would be a mistake.</strong> So I don't know.<br />\n<br />\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't worry that this is too much of a concession on national security grounds?<br />\n<br />\nSEN. GRAHAM: I don't know yet. It's clearly a concession. There's some type equipment we could sell to Huawei and other Chinese companies that would not hurt our national security. <strong>But there's a reason that Huawei has been on the- on the banned list. It is a Chinese company owned by the Chinese government deeply controlled by the military that could be used to hijack technology, data and- and steal trade secrets and other things.</strong> So, I don't know the nature of the exception. There'll be a lot of pushback if this is a major concession. If it's a minor concession, I think it's part of the overall deal."},{"pid":"f55a87c3e1f2a1fd5faa2b0d362f941309b90265","tid":1270547,"uid":45914,"like":5,"dislike":15,"score":-10,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T00:50:13.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"320f457d7f46b9dd0f42f95fcdd2f7fa9b1304e2","tid":1270547,"uid":134071,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T00:50:14.000Z","msg":"唔少共和黨議員都炮轟「華為」<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-trump-adviser-larry-kudlow-insists-us-sales-to-huawei-wont-imperil/?cmpid=rss&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theglobeandmail.com%2Fworld%2Fus-politics%2Farticle-trump-adviser-larry-kudlow-insists-us-sales-to-huawei-wont-imperil%2F%3Fcmpid%3Drss%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&d=YBElpbzmALMQinc%2Bu7edP1u%2BYei5PLor89YqF%2FSdhCs%3D&h=757e9690\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-trump-adviser-larry-kudlow-insists-us-sales-to-huawei-wont-imperil/?cmpid=rss&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter</a><br />\n<br />\nSeveral Republican senators immediately expressed concerns.
