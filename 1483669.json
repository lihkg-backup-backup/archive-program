British National Overseas citizens are the only few nationalities with no right of abode in their own country.<br />\n<br />\nAs you may see on the news, China has breached the Sino-British Joint Declaration repeatedly, putting the lives of Hong Kong people at risk. We have no choice but to suffer under the Chinese rule.<br />\n<br />\nWe (British National Overseas citizens) are quality British. We can make Britain great again with the following facts:<br />\n1. Hong Kong people are highly educated. The majority of the young people received tertiary education. <br />\n2. GDP per capital of Hong Kong is comparable to that of UK, which ranks rank 15th in the world according to the International Monetary Fund (2018).<br />\n3. The average Hongkonger owns USD$245,000, which ranks 14th in the world according to the Global Wealth Report 2018 published by the Credit Suisse Research Institute.<br />\n4. Hong Kong people share common value with British.<br />\n5. Hong Kong people are pragmatic, industrious. We want to contribute to society.<br />\n6. We respect the rule of law because this is taught by the British before 1997.<br />\n<br />\nAs Tom Tugendhat (MP) put forward: &ldquo;The UK had obligations to Hong Kong citizens before 1997, and the extension of overseas citizenship, which is in many ways a second-tier citizenship, was a mistake, and I think it&rsquo;s one that should be corrected. At a time when there are clearly tensions in Hong Kong, the UK could reassure many Hong Kong citizens that their existing rights are recognised by the UK, and they are valued.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nPlease help Hong Kong by signing this petition:<br />\n<a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/244402\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpetition.parliament.uk%2Fpetitions%2F244402&d=xzf4O3tGv54ZmzQe4QccrD9kuezr8BQg8uGmIe3q97E%3D&h=e1e9927a\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/244402</a><br />\n<br />\nYou help is much appreciated.<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks,<br />\nBritish National Overseas citizens<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/jtvxPGP.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FjtvxPGP.jpg&h=a84e7b9a&s={SIZE}\" />"}]}
