The only other people in the room were Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Witty and Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill.<br />\n<br />\nThe use of US-based Zoom has 'exploded' in popularity but concerns have been raised over its security, according to an industry expert.<br />\n<br />\nIt is thought swathes of businesses and organisations have flocked to use the technology in the last week as the UK went into lockdown, in a bid to continue meetings with employees who have been forced to work from home.<br />\n<br />\nGrowing numbers of people are also using it socially to catch up with friends virtually while stuck indoors.<br />\n<br />\nIt has prompted some online debate as to whether there are security and privacy concerns about using the platform.<br />\n<br />\nA message to MoD staff, seen by PA, said: 'We are pausing the use of Zoom, an internet-based video conferencing service, with immediate effect whilst we investigate security implications that come with it.'<br />\n<br />\nA decision will then be made about whether to continue using the programme, the email added.<br />\n<br />\nPaul Bischoff, from <a href=\"http://Comparitech.com\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2FComparitech.com&d=8fAJgc%2Bq%2B0y88RV8Svjv4Y2ydpG6lAcy7lEd76f4zig%3D&h=c56b5f1a\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">Comparitech.com</a> which researches and tests out security, privacy and networking technology, told PA that Zoom is 'exploding in popularity' and usage is becoming more 'commonplace'.<br />\n<br />\nWhile the programme is 'fairly secure', he warned the company was 'slow' to address a 'webcam security flaw' last year which 'angered' some users and security experts.<br />\n<br />\nThe problem allowed an attacker to hijack the user's webcam through Safari on Apple Macs, he said.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to a media reports earlier this month, users were warned against 'Zoom bombing' after sessions were hijacked by strangers sharing porn videos.<br />\n<br />\nAround the same time, Zoom, which describes its service as reliable and easy to use, published an article with advice for users entitled 'How to keep the party crashers from crashing your Zoom event'.<br />\n<br />\nMr Bischoff said: 'The software has no known serious vulnerabilities at the moment, but that doesn't mean a hacker won't find a new vulnerability tomorrow.<br />\n<br />\n'The company also collects some personal information about users and shares it with a few third parties.'<br />\n<br />\nHe added it is important to verify links and senders before clicking on them because 'criminals will probably create phishing pages designed to look like Zoom pages, but they really just steal your passwords and other information'."},{"pid":"7edbe17e11770d5927f9542809b8a2c6d8a45e46","tid":1943855,"uid":30791,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-26T04:26:55.000Z","msg":"<img
