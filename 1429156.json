At home sitting in a recliner or an armchair or on a sofa rather than in a chair or on a stool can work wonders for your body. Eating a balanced diet of veggies and fruits and a little meat does wonders for your health. Exercise and meditation do wonders for mind and body. I&rsquo;m waiting for my friend on the corner outside Times Square. He lives just round the corner so it&rsquo;ll take him five minutes to come. Meanwhile a pedestrian came and asked if there was any medical centre nearby because he had been suffering from heatstroke. I told him there were a clinic and a pharmacy just around the corner. As summer is around the corner people suffer from heatstroke more easily"}]}
