src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n以下為節錄<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n-女人最適宜的職業是看護和教育兒童，因為她們本身實際上就很幼稚、輕佻漂浮、目光短淺，一句話，她們的畢生實際就是一個大兒童&mdash;&mdash;是兒童與嚴格意義上的成人的中間體。看吧，一個姑娘整天與兒童為伍，跟他們一起跳舞、唱歌，回過來想想，一個男人即使想誠心誠意這樣去做，但他處於那個姑娘的位置，他怎能忍受呢。<br />\n<br />\n-實際上，女人可以被描述為理智上的目光短淺者，儘管女人也可以憑直覺去理解眼前的事物，但畢竟視野狹窄而顧及不到遠處。所以，那些表面上不存在的，逝去和將來的事情對女人的影響，遠比對男人的影響要小，這就解釋了女人為什麼更能接受奢侈的生活，而她們的嗜好有時會達到瘋狂地步的緣由。在女人心中，男人就是掙錢、幹事的，消費才是女人自己的事&mdash;&mdash;如果可能，丈夫在世時，為了維持家用，把薪俸交給妻子，至少在丈夫死後就是這樣的，所以才更使她們堅定了自己上述想法。<br />\n<br />\n-在這裡，我們發現了在女人的秉性中所缺乏的就是毫無正義感。根本原因就在於我們上面所述的女人缺乏判斷力和思考力，當然也在於她們所處的地位，自然之神則令她們性別的孱弱。女人不依賴力量，而是依賴詭計，亦即依賴她們狡黠的本能和虛偽的本性，就像雄獅有尖爪利齒、象與野豬有獠牙、牛有角、烏賊有黑煙樣墨汁那樣，自然之神賦予女人防衛的武器就是掩飾的詭術。而自然之神賦予男人的則是強壯的體魄和理智。掩飾是女人的本能，無論是聰明的女人還是愚蠢的女人均如此。女人隨時隨地都在運用這種本領，這也是天經地義的，就好像是受到襲擊的動物一定用自衛的方式一樣，她們覺得這樣做就是她們的權力。"},{"pid":"f08619d9e0547f12dbf583eb1d78b707e544d896","tid":461906,"uid":42119,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-08T05:35:54.000Z","msg":"<img

privilege which the institution of monogamy, and the laws of marriage which accompany it, assign to the woman, whereby she is regarded throughout as a full equivalent of the man, which she is not by any means, cause intelligent and prudent men to reflect a great deal before they make so great a sacrifice and consent to so unfair an arrangement. Therefore, whilst among polygamous nations every woman finds maintenance, where monogamy exists the number of married women is limited, and a countless number of women who are without support remain over; those in the upper classes vegetate as useless old maids, those in the lower are reduced to very hard work of a distasteful nature, or become prostitutes, and lead a life which is as joyless as it is void of honour. But under such circumstances they become a necessity to the masculine sex; so that their position is openly recognised as a special means for protecting from seduction those other women favoured by fate either to have found husbands, or who hope to find them. In London alone there are 80,000 prostitutes. Then what are these women who have come too quickly to this most terrible end but human sacrifices on the altar of monogamy? The women here referred to and who are placed in this wretched position are the inevitable counterbalance to the European lady, with her pretensions and arrogance. Hence polygamy is a real benefit to the female sex, taking it as a whole. And, on the other hand, there is no reason why a man whose wife suffers from chronic illness, or remains barren, or has gradually become too old for him, should not take a second. <span style=\"color: red;\">Many people become converts to Mormonism for the precise reasons that they condemn the unnatural institution of monogamy. </span>The conferring of unnatural rights upon women has imposed unnatural duties upon them, the violation of which, however, makes them unhappy. For example, many a man thinks marriage unadvisable as far as his social standing and monetary position are concerned, unless he contracts a brilliant match. He will then wish to win a woman of his own choice under different conditions, namely, under those which will render safe her future and that of her children. Be the conditions ever so just, reasonable, and adequate, and she consents by giving up those undue privileges which marriage, as the basis of civil society, alone can bestow, she must to a certain extent lose her honour and lead a life of loneliness; since human nature makes us dependent on the opinion of others in a way that is completely out of proportion to its value. While, if the woman does not consent, she runs the risk of being compelled to marry a man she dislikes, or of shrivelling up into an old maid; for the time allotted to her to find a home is very short. In view of this side of the institution of monogamy, Thomasius&rsquo;s profoundly learned treatise, de Concubinatu, is well worth reading, for it shows that, among all nations, and in all ages, down to the Lutheran Reformation, concubinage was allowed, nay, that it was an institution, in a certain measure even recognised by law and associated with no dishonour. And it held this position until the Lutheran Reformation, when it was recognised as another means for justifying the marriage of the clergy; whereupon the Catholic party did not dare to remain behindhand in the matter.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 好撚正"}]}
