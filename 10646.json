Use of [Dengue Vaccine] Effective in Some Regions, Risky in Others<br />\n<br />\nThe World Health Organization is continuing to assess the risks and benefits of the first vaccine developed to prevent dengue fever. <br />\n<br />\nAccording to the new report, the vaccine could potentially reduce the incidence of dengue fever between 6 percent and 25 percent in countries with moderate to high transmission rates, where at least 50 percent of children get infected for the first time by their ninth birthday. *Investigators concluded a policy of routinely vaccinating 80 percent of 9-year-olds is needed to realize the reduction in cases*.<br />\n<br />\nApproximately half of the world's population is at risk for contracting dengue, a mosquito-borne illness that can cause high fever, joint pain, bleeding and potentially, death by dengue shock syndrome.<br />\n<br />\nA person can potentially be infected by four [different strains of the virus], and can be infected more than once. A second infection is generally the worst. In people who have been infected the first time, the vaccine may prevent a serious second infection. <br />\n<br />\nAn estimated 400 million people are infected every year with dengue fever in [tropical countries], with 2 million developing a severe, hemorrhagic form of the disease. *Of these*, some 25,000 people die.<br />\n<br />\nIn the earlier study, published in the journal Science, researchers found Dengvaxia can reduce severe illness and hospitalizations by 20 to 30 percent in countries where infection rates are high. Regulators in several countries, mostly in Latin America, have approved the vaccine for use."},{"pid":"4a5ae875967533883996280d89a3d2e6b7b710ca","tid":10646,"uid":8141,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-12-01T13:25:28.000Z","msg":"Source: <a

Clear Air, Israel Shuts Charcoal Factories, Costing Palestinians Jobs <br />\n<br />\nFor years, residents of central Israel *have been complaining about air pollution* from Palestinian factories in the nearby West Bank. Now that authorities have finally *cracked down*, shutting a group of the worst offending [charcoal] plants in one notorious town, Palestinians complain that hundreds were thrown out of work by their military occupiers. <br />\n<br />\nIn Israel, factories face close environmental oversight, but in the semi-autonomous West Bank it&rsquo;s far trickier. For instance, the home of the Palestinian charcoal industry in Yabed is in an area that falls under Palestinian civil authority, but where Israel retains security control, as in most of the West Bank&rsquo;s area.<br />\n<br />\nAfter years of *failed dialogue* with the local Palestinian leadership, Israel&rsquo;s military *took matters into its own hands* in November, shutting down more than a dozen factories and [confiscating] equipment and 160 tons of wood that was to be used to produce charcoal.<br />\n<br />\nMordechai said a quarter of Yabed&rsquo;s children and 70 percent of those in the charcoal industry have reported some form of [respiratory] illness. <br />\n<br />\nCOGAT spokeswoman Hadar Horen said Mordechai has held meetings with residents. She said he hopes to find a way to reopen the factories under healthier conditions. She also said that Israel *has granted thousands of work permits for Palestinian laborers*, and that villagers were encouraged to apply for them to find alternative

And talk about the possible diplomatic and economic blowback from Beijing is growing.<br />\n<br />\nCall me<br />\n<br />\nOn Friday, President-elect Trump broke with decades of diplomatic tip-toeing and spoke directly with Taiwan&rsquo;s President Tsai Ing-wen on the phone. The call shocked Beijing not only because with it Trump became the first president-elect to make such a call, but also because in his Tweet, Trump referred to her by her official title: President Tsai.<br />\n<br />\nThe United States switched diplomatic ties to Beijing in 1979 and China claims the democratically-ruled island as part of its own territory. Under agreements made as part of that shift in diplomatic recognition, Washington agreed to cut political ties with Taiwan.<br />\n<br />\nBut just as Beijing was recovering from that assault on its diplomatic senses, Trump released two more Tweets early Monday, Beijing time.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into..&rdquo; he said in one Tweet and continued in another&hellip; &ldquo;their country (the U.S. doesn&rsquo;t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?

So which is it this year: Better or worse? The challenge for Donald Trump is how profoundly the country disagrees about the answer.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s hard to measure the scale of his disruption. This real estate baron and casino owner turned reality-TV star and provocateur&mdash;never a day spent in public office, never a debt owed to any interest besides his own&mdash;now surveys the smoking ruin of a vast political edifice that once housed parties, pundits, donors, pollsters, all those who did not see him coming or take him seriously. Out of this reckoning, Trump is poised to preside, for better or worse.<br />\n<br />\nFor those who believe this is all for the better, Trump&rsquo;s victory represents a long-overdue rebuke to an entrenched and arrogant governing class; for those who see it as for the worse, the destruction extends to cherished norms of civility and discourse, a politics poisoned by vile streams of racism, sexism, nativism. To his believers, he delivers change&mdash;broad, deep, historic change, not modest measures doled out in Dixie cups; to his detractors, he inspires fear both for what he may do and what may be done in his name.<br />\n<br />\nThe revolution he stirred feels fully American, with its echoes of populists past, of Andrew Jackson and Huey Long and, at its most sinister, Joe McCarthy and Charles Coughlin. Trump&rsquo;s assault on truth and logic, far from hurting him, made him stronger. His appeal&mdash;part hope, part snarl&mdash;dissolved party lines and dispatched the two reigning dynasties of U.S. politics. Yet his victory mirrors the ascent of nationalists across the world, from Britain to the Philippines, and taps forces far more powerful than one man&rsquo;s message.<br />\n<br />\n<a

money services, experts said Thursday, calling for the technology to be introduced in other developing countries.<br />\n<br />\nThe impact was most dramatic among single mothers who used M-Pesa, a text message-based mobile payment system, after switching from farming to business and retail sales, the journal Science found.<br />\n<br />\nThe expansion of M-Pesa, which is used in virtually every Kenyan home, lifted 194,000 households &mdash; or 2 percent of households nationwide &mdash; above the poverty line in six years, the study found.<br />\n<br />\nIt provides further evidence that mobile phone technology can help to bring financial services to the 80 percent of African women who do not have bank accounts and bolster growth of the world's poorest continent.<br />\n<br />\nM-Pesa

concept of education.<br />\n<br />\nTwelve-year-old Mishal Junaid loves the unconventional methods of this Khan Lab School.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;When I wake up in the morning I want to wake up, unlike my last school where I want to sleep in and not go to school,&rdquo; she said.<br />\n<br />\nJunaid and her sister&rsquo;s response to the school surprises their parents.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Our children, they love going to school, to the point that even if they are tired or sick or have the flu or whatever, they will not skip school.

You get to set your own goals; you have a schedule. You go to different classes,&rdquo; said 9-year-old student Holly Thompson.<br />\n<br />\nThe school is the idea of Salman Khan, the founder of Khan Academy &mdash; famous for its free online educational videos that have millions of users worldwide. Khan said he started Khan Lab School because he thinks the current education system is flawed, and he hopes to create a better learning model.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Where I see the future going is somewhat revisiting the past. There&rsquo;s a lot of really good things about the one room schoolhouse that you might have had in the rural areas that you still have today in a lot of places where you have mixed age classrooms. The advantage there is that older students can take responsibility and mentor younger ones. Younger students get more people. They get the teacher, but also other students being invested in their work,&rdquo; said Khan."},{"pid":"9c7b4702dafc7a751824c9694736884d17a34208","tid":10646,"uid":8141,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-12-10T16:27:52.000Z","msg":"Personalized learning<br />\n<br />\nKhan said students also learn material at their own pace through videos and more attention from teachers through one-on-one dialogue instead of lectures.

They are stuck in their artifacts. What we&rsquo;re trying here is really to challenge that,&rdquo; he observed.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The role of a teacher needs to change from being kind of a lecturer toward more being like a curator, a tutor but also lifelong learner and an assessor instead of just somebody who just lectures. And on the student side the student is shifting, as well, from a consumer to be more creative.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nKhan is experimenting to see what elements of this private school can apply to public schools, with students from more disadvantaged families.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;That is why we partner with local schools that serve all sorts of demographics,&quot; said Khan. &quot;This is I think an imperative for all students that it levels the playing field much more if all of your work is done while you&rsquo;re at school in that 8:30 to 6 p.m. It puts less of a burden on working parents if their kids are taken care of until 6, and it&rsquo;s productive time.&quot;"},{"pid":"94963d41e181f92c0fbb874f90741a488f99b27a","tid":10646,"uid":8141,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-12-10T16:28:54.000Z","msg":"Source : <a

Dylan Nobel Prize speech<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\nBob Dylan:<br />\n<br />\nGood evening, everyone. I extend my warmest greetings to the members of the Swedish Academy and to all of the other distinguished guests in attendance tonight.<br />\n<br />\nI&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t be with you in person, but please know that I am most definitely with you in spirit and honored to be receiving such a prestigious prize. Being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature is something I never could have imagined or seen coming. From an early age, I&rsquo;ve been familiar with and reading and absorbing the works of those who were deemed worthy of such a distinction: Kipling, Shaw, Thomas Mann, Pearl Buck, Albert Camus, Hemingway. These giants of literature whose works are taught in the schoolroom, housed in libraries around the world and spoken of in reverent tones have always made a deep impression. That I now join the names on such a list is truly beyond words.<br />\n<br />\nI don&rsquo;t know if these men and women ever thought of the Nobel honor for themselves, but I suppose that anyone writing a book, or a poem, or a play anywhere in the world might harbor that secret dream deep down inside. It&rsquo;s probably buried so deep that they don&rsquo;t even know it&rsquo;s there.<br />\nIf someone had ever told me that I had the slightest chance of winning the Nobel Prize, I would have to think that I&rsquo;d have about the same odds as standing on the moon. In fact, during the year I was born and for a few years after, there wasn&rsquo;t anyone in the world who was considered good enough to win this Nobel Prize. So, I recognize that I am in very rare company, to say the least."},{"pid":"9e17c90ae4af7cba158bb71b3b39dec825823211","tid":10646,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-12-12T02:25:37.000Z","msg":"I was out on the road when I received this surprising news, and it took me more than a few minutes to properly process it.

Kong at a crossroads<br />\nMake no mistake. The battle going on in Hong Kong&rsquo;s courts is not a dry legal issue about whether two young lawmakers took their oaths properly and should therefore be permitted to take their seats in the Legislative Council (&ldquo;Nipped in the bud&rdquo;, November 19th). The opportunistic attempt to try to ban legislators by judicial means, supported by a lightning-quick interpretation of the Basic Law, was taken by Hong Kong&rsquo;s chief executive and the people he answers to.<br />\n<br />\nWe are at a dangerous moment. A drive may be on to rid Hong Kong of independence advocates. When that goal has been achieved, probably through more court judgments and interpretations, the focus will switch to other inconvenient viewpoints. Perhaps it will be issue-specific, such as opposition to national education, or resistance to security legislation, or maybe it will be a more general antipathy towards democratic and liberal ideas.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong could go down the authoritarian-lite route, with a democratic fa&ccedil;ade but where you risk being sued for expressing contrarian views, leading to self-censorship, or it may be headed towards full-blown suppression. Whichever route the government takes, polarisation has already set in, between those in Hong Kong who hold themselves out as loyalists, or think it is expedient to do so, and those who hold liberal, democratic values.

Police officers were also injured in skirmishes with protesters.<br />\n<br />\nThe heavy-handed police measures, including the city&rsquo;s first use of tear gas in years and the presence of officers with long-barreled guns, appeared to galvanize the public, drawing more people onto the streets. On Monday morning, protesters controlled major thoroughfares in at least three parts of the city. A few unions and the Hong Kong Federation of Students called for strikes, and the federation urged a boycott of classes.<br />\n<br />\nLate Monday morning, the Hong Kong government said it had pulled back the riot police from roads where protesters had blocked traffic. The government urged protesters to end their sit-in demonstrations.<br />\n<br />\nChina Restricts Voting Reforms for Hong Kong AUG. 31, 2014<br />\nThe confrontation threatened to tarnish Hong Kong&rsquo;s reputation as a safe enclave for commerce, and immediately raised the political cost of Beijing&rsquo;s unyielding position on electoral change here; footage and photos of unarmed students standing in clouds of tear gas facing off with riot police officers flashed around the world on Sunday. It also set the stage for a prolonged struggle that poses a test for President Xi Jinping of China, who has championed a harsh line against political threats to Communist Party rule.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;If this one gets out of control, Xi will also lose face,&rdquo; Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a commentator on Chinese politics who teaches at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said in an interview. &ldquo;Everyone knows he&rsquo;s the one running the show.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThousands of pro-democracy protesters had been gathering in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters since Friday, despite official warnings to leave. But on Sunday afternoon, the police moved in, lobbing tear gas canisters into the crowd and stopping supporters of the protest from entering the area."},{"pid":"d29df439c5728d23ab80a74b5190c10b6d4c4eeb","tid":10646,"uid":22858,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-12-21T14:49:09.000Z","msg":"Thousands of people who had been prevented from entering the protest area then spilled onto the nearby streets, and protests and confrontations with the police multiplied across the city, as news and images of the crackdown spread. The police repeatedly hurled tear gas at the roaming crowds, further infuriating the protesters.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this, never imagined it,&rdquo; said Kevin Chan, a 48-year-old factory manager who joined many thousands of people gathered at night on the road near the government offices. &ldquo;The government must awaken that this is the Hong Kong people,&rdquo; he said, gesturing to the crowd, mostly people in their 20s. &ldquo;These are not their enemies. These are the people.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe escalation of the protests, and the unusually strong response by the police, pointed to the possibility of a long confrontation between a city government pressured by the Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s demands for top-down control and residents&rsquo; demands for a city leadership chosen by democratic means.<br />\n<br />\nThe protest at the government offices was started by students demanding such electoral changes. Beijing last month proposed that the public would be able to vote for the city&rsquo;s chief executive, beginning in 2017. But a committee dominated by people loyal to the Chinese government would be able to screen out candidates who did not have Beijing&rsquo;s backing.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;What is going on now, in addition to any immediate public order issues, is a battle for the hearts and minds of the Hong Kong public,&rdquo; said Michael C. Davis, a professor of law at the University of Hong Kong, who has closely followed the debate over election reform. &ldquo;Beijing may be indifferent to protest or at least not inclined to give in. The Hong Kong government needs public support.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe police issued a warning Sunday evening saying that a lockdown had been imposed on several downtown areas, including the vicinity of the central government&rsquo;s offices, and declared any assembly near the offices unlawful. Officials had earlier in the weekend reported 78 arrests.<br />\n<br />\nBut late into the night and on Monday morning, many thousands of residents remained on the streets, denouncing the police crackdown and staging sit-ins in several neighborhoods outside the original protest area. In the neon-lit shopping districts of Causeway Bay and Mong Kok, which were packed with shoppers, hundreds of protesters blocked traffic."},{"pid":"eb4f647a899154a1923cd94c61413572153e1da1","tid":10646,"uid":22858,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-12-21T14:49:19.000Z","msg":"At Admiralty, an area dominated by sleek malls, office towers and hotels, the main avenues were dense with thousands of chanting protesters, many wearing homemade masks and wet towels in case of tear gas. The police also used tear gas in the heart of Hong Kong&rsquo;s financial district, known as Central, where a much smaller crowd had gathered under the HSBC Building, a feature of the city&rsquo;s skyline.<br />\n<br />\nRicky Lau, 26, a business student at Chinese University of Hong Kong who was there, said the police had shot tear gas without warning.<br />\n<br />\nAlan Leong, the leader of the Civic Party and a member of the city legislative council, said, &ldquo;Tear gas may have the immediate effect of dispersing the peaceful demonstrators, but if you make people cry, and the tears are from their heart, how can you govern?&rdquo; In an interview on the sideline of the protest, he recalled that the Hong Kong police used tear gas in 2005 against protesters during the World Trade Organization meeting and in 1967 when leftists loyal to Mao Zedong rioted across the city.<br />\n<br />\nOn Monday morning, protesters in thinning numbers continued to occupy roads and intersections, including at Admiralty, where the police urged the crowds to leave the roads, which are usually busy with commuters heading to work. Wednesday will be a public holiday in Hong Kong, which could encourage more protesters to take to the streets.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong was a British colony until 1997, when China resumed sovereignty. Since then, it has operated under a policy of &ldquo;one country, two systems,&rdquo; which keeps its independent judiciary and many freedoms, including a robust tradition of free speech. But many democratic groups say that China has chipped away at those freedoms, and that the election law proposals were the latest, most infuriating example.<br />\n<br />\nThe Chinese government endorsed the tough approach to the protests. The Hong Kong government blamed the unrest on Occupy Central With Love and Peace, a group that has spearheaded demands for greater democracy.<br />\n<br />\nOccupy Central had planned to begin protests in the financial district on Wednesday. But the group changed course on Sunday, declaring that the &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; in front of the city government would be the base of protests.<br />\n<br />\nSteve Lee, 23, a recent university graduate who joined the protest, sobbed on the sidewalk after being exposed to tear gas. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how the government can, in less than 30 seconds after a warning, use tear gas against peaceful student protesters,&rdquo; he said.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Hong Kong has gone crazy,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It is no longer the Hong Kong I know, or the world knows.&rdquo;<br />\n<br

Media Use Linked to Depression <br />\n<br />\nHeavy usage of social media can lead to depression, according to a new study.<br />\n<br />\nWriting in the journal Computers in Human Behavior, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health (CRMTH), say &ldquo;use of multiple platforms is more strongly associated with depression and anxiety among young adults.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nSpecifically, researchers found that people who report using between seven and 11 social media platforms are three times more likely to develop depression and anxiety than those who use between zero and two platforms.<br />\n<br />\nThese findings were the same even when adjusted for the total time users spent on social media.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;This association is strong enough that clinicians could consider asking their patients with depression and anxiety about multiple platform use and counseling them that this use may be related to their symptoms,&rdquo; said lead author and physician Brian A. Primack. &ldquo;While we can&rsquo;t tell from this study whether depressed and anxious people seek out multiple platforms or whether something about using multiple platforms can lead to depression and anxiety, in either case the results are potentially valuable.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nFor the study, researchers sampled 1,787 American adults between 19 and 32 to determine social media use and depression. The surveys asked about 11 social media sites, including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, LinkedIn and others.<br />\n<br />\nWhile those who used seven to 11 of these platforms reported three times more depression, Primack says more study needs to be done.<br />\n<br />\nResearchers are not sure why heavy use of social media drives depression and anxiety, but they do have some theories.<br />\n<br />\nFor one, multitasking &rdquo;is known to be related to poor cognitive and mental health outcomes,&rdquo; researchers said.<br />\n<br />\nAlso the &ldquo;distinct set of unwritten rules, cultural assumptions and idiosyncrasies of each platform are increasingly difficult to navigate when the number of platforms used rises, which could lead to negative mood and emotions,&rdquo; researchers said.<br />\n<br />\nLastly, being on more platforms leads to a greater chance to commit a &ldquo;social media faux pas,&rdquo; which can cause repeated embarrassment."},{"pid":"93e08c0a47b4f1b2841ae28081a66846377c4e7d","tid":10646,"uid":8141,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-12-23T18:13:02.000Z","msg":"<a

Six people survived the crash and were taken to local hospitals, according to authorities.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The dream is over,&quot; Plinio David de Nes Filho, chairman of the club's board told TV Globo. &quot;Yesterday morning I was saying goodbye to them, they told me they were going in search of the dream, to make this dream a reality.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;And we, very excitedly, shared this dream with them. But the dream was over this morning.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nChapecoense was supposed to play the first leg of its Copa Sudamericana final on Wednesday against Colombian side Atletico Nacional from Medellin before its plane came down.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Chapecoense was one of the most lovely fairy tales,&quot; Argentine sports journalist Martin Mazur told CNN. &quot;Unlike what happens with the big Brazilian clubs, Chapecoense's humble story and its magnificent run in the Copa Sudamericana was naturally embraced by Brazilian football fans in general, becoming a fans' favorite.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It was South America's Cinderella -- nobody could have predicted this macabre ending.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe Copa Sudamericana, the second biggest intercontinental club competition in South America and the equivalent to Europe's Europa League, had provided the backdrop to Chapecoense's remarkable story.<br />\n<br />\nThe club, from Chapeco in the state of Santa Catarina in the south of Brazil was only formed in the 1970s and was playing in the country's fourth tier as recently as 2007.<br />\n<br />\nA team with few big names, apart from Cleber Santana, who once played for Atletico Madrid and Mallorca in Spain, it went toe-to-toe with the big boys of Brazilian football.<br />\n<br />\nFull of grit, team spirit and determination, not to mention quality, Chapecoense was a relatively unfashionable team hoping to tread a path laid out by English champions Leicester City.<br />\n<br />\n<a

style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Predictions for 2017: politics</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\">23 DECEMBER 2016 &bull; 9:00AM</span><br />\n<br />\nFollowing a turbulent 2016, the Telegraph's political commentators voice their predictions for 2017, from Brexit and elections in Europe to the Donald Trump presidency, Russia and the Middle East.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Let's be clear on policy for Brexit and climate change</em><br />\n<br />\nNo crystal ball is needed to predict the dominant political stories of 2017. For the UK it will be about Brexit: the triggering of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty at the end of March to enable the UK to leave the European Union, the response of the EU and the subsequent discussions. For the wider world it will be all about the first year of the Trump presidency in the US.<br />\n<br />\nSo far as Brexit is concerned, I would expect the British position to be clear. We will offer a free trade agreement with the EU with no strings attached. By &ldquo;no strings&rdquo; I mean the restoration of unfettered UK control of our own borders (although EU citizens already resident in the UK would have the equally unfettered right to remain), the cessation of UK contributions to the EU budget and the end of the supremacy of European law and the European Court of Justice over UK law and the UK courts.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough this would be overwhelmingly in the interests of EU businesses &ndash; and thus the faltering EU economy &ndash; which sell far more to us than we do to them, I expect this proposal to be rejected. The European Union is a political, not an economic, project. Europe&rsquo;s leaders &ndash; and above all the Eurocracy &ndash; are scared that were they to accept this proposal, other member states would demand the same, and the entire European project would start to unravel.<br />\n<br />\nWhat will become increasingly clear during 2017 is that we&rsquo;ll have to fall back to the second-best option: trading with the EU on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. That is no disaster. Our trade with the vast majority of the rest of the world is on WTO terms, and we do far more trade with the rest of the world than we do with the rest of the EU.<br />\n<br />\nOur trade with the rest of the world has for some time been growing faster than our trade with the EU. The question isn&rsquo;t whether we will have &ldquo;access&rdquo; to the so-called single market: everybody does. The question is what the terms of access will be &ndash; WTO terms are perfectly acceptable.<br />\n<br />\nAs all this becomes apparent, I expect the debate to shift to the much more important Brexit issue of how we will conduct ourselves once we have regained our freedom of action. In particular, of the vast corpus of EU legislation and regulation, which at present we are obliged to have as part of UK law, which do we wish to repeal or amend?"},{"pid":"366a58db46ae8ac511eb392cb5ccf7fd33923523","tid":10646,"uid":22858,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-12-26T13:15:44.000Z","msg":"Once we regain control of our borders, what should our immigration policy be? And, free from the EU Common Agricultural Policy, what should our farming policy be?<br />\n<br />\nAs to this last point, there is a read-across to trade policy. It is little short of a scandal that, in order to protect European farmers, EU tariffs on food imports from the developing world are three times as high as on manufactures. We should take the opportunity to slash these, which would mean both cheaper food and greater help to the developing world &ndash; unlike official development aid which, as economist Prof Angus Deaton has found, can do more harm than good.<br />\n<br />\nAs to President-elect Trump, prediction is harder, since he revels in being unpredictable. But while there is cause for concern, one positive change stands out. On climate policy, whether or not he goes ahead with his promise to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, it is clear &ndash; not least from the choice of Scott Pruitt to head the US Environmental Protection Agency &ndash; that he intends to ignore it, as indeed both China and India, while pretending to abide by it, are doing.<br />\n<br />\nThis is no disaster, too. Over the past century-and-a-half of industrialisation, it&rsquo;s officially estimated average global temperature has risen by 1C. Fossil fuels have made a contribution to this, though how much is uncertain. But this is trivial: there are plenty of countries thriving with a temperature well above the global average.<br />\n<br />\nBut what&rsquo;s far from trivial is the cost of current climate policy to the British economy. The UK accounts for less than 2 per cent of global CO2 emissions, but a new report by Peter Lilley for the Global Warming Policy Foundation, based on official figures, finds this to be in excess of &pound;300billion &ndash; a burden that falls most severely on the poorest.<br />\n<br />\nWith Mr Trump &ndash; on this issue, at least &ndash; leading the world in a more rational direction, the UK might come to its senses on climate policy in 2017.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\"><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/predictions-2017/politics/\"

George Soros<br />\n<br />\nNEW YORK &ndash; Well before Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, I sent a holiday greeting to my friends that read: &ldquo;These times are not business as usual. Wishing you the best in a troubled world.&rdquo; Now I feel the need to share this message with the rest of the world. But before I do, I must tell you who I am and what I stand for.<br />\n<br />\nI am an 86-year-old Hungarian Jew who became a US citizen after the end of World War II. I learned at an early age how important it is what kind of political regime prevails. The formative experience of my life was the occupation of Hungary by Hitler&rsquo;s Germany in 1944. I probably would have perished had my father not understood the gravity of the situation. He arranged false identities for his family and for many other Jews; with his help, most survived.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1947, I escaped from Hungary, by then under Communist rule, to England. As a student at the London School of Economics, I came under the influence of the philosopher Karl Popper, and I developed my own philosophy, built on the twin pillars of fallibility and reflexivity. I distinguished between two kinds of political regimes: those in which people elected their leaders, who were then supposed to look after the interests of the electorate, and others where the rulers sought to manipulate their subjects to serve the rulers&rsquo; interests. Under Popper&rsquo;s influence, I called the first kind of society open, the second, closed.<br />\n<br />\nThe classification is too simplistic. There are many degrees and variations throughout history, from well-functioning models to failed states, and many different levels of government in any particular situation. Even so, I find the distinction between the two regime types useful. I became an active promoter of the former and opponent of the latter.<br />\n<br />\nI find the current moment in history very painful. Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of closed societies &ndash; from fascist dictatorships to mafia states &ndash; are on the rise. How could this happen? The only explanation I can find is that elected leaders failed to meet voters&rsquo; legitimate expectations and aspirations and that this failure led electorates to become disenchanted with the prevailing versions of democracy and capitalism. Quite simply, many people felt that the elites had stolen their democracy.<br />\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US emerged as the sole remaining superpower, equally committed to the principles of democracy and free markets. The major development since then has been the globalization of financial markets, spearheaded by advocates who argued that globalization increases total wealth. After all, if the winners compensated the losers, they would still have something left over.<br />\n<br />\nThe argument was misleading, because it ignored the fact that the winners seldom, if ever, compensate the losers. But the potential winners spent enough money promoting the argument that it prevailed. It was a victory for believers in untrammeled free enterprise, or &ldquo;market fundamentalists,&rdquo; as I call them. Because financial capital is an indispensable ingredient of economic development, and few countries in the developing world could generate enough capital on their own, globalization spread like wildfire. Financial capital could move around freely and avoid taxation and regulation.<br />\n<br />\nGlobalization has had far-reaching economic and political consequences. It has brought about some economic convergence between poor and rich countries; but it increased inequality within both poor and rich countries. In the developed world, the benefits accrued mainly to large owners of financial capital, who constitute less than 1% of the population. The lack of redistributive policies is the main source of the dissatisfaction that democracy&rsquo;s opponents have exploited.

It started out at as a bold experiment in what Popper called &ldquo;piecemeal social engineering.&rdquo; The leaders set an attainable objective and a fixed timeline and mobilized the political will needed to meet it, knowing full well that each step would necessitate a further step forward. That is how the European Coal and Steel Community developed into the EU.<br />\n<br />\nBut then something went woefully wrong. After the Crash of 2008, a voluntary association of equals was transformed into a relationship between creditors and debtors, where the debtors had difficulties in meeting their obligations and the creditors set the conditions the debtors had to obey. That relationship has been neither voluntary nor equal.<br />\n<br />\nGermany emerged as the hegemonic power in Europe, but it failed to live up to the obligations that successful hegemons must fulfill, namely looking beyond their narrow self-interest to the interests of the people who depend on them. Compare the behavior of the US after WWII with Germany&rsquo;s behavior after the Crash of 2008: the US launched the Marshall Plan, which led to the development of the EU; Germany imposed an austerity program that served its narrow self-interest.<br />\nBefore its reunification, Germany was the main force driving European integration: it was always willing to contribute a little bit extra to accommodate those putting up resistance. Remember Germany&rsquo;s contribution to meeting Margaret <br />\nThatcher&rsquo;s demands regarding the EU budget?<br />\n<br />\nBut reuniting Germany on a 1:1 basis turned out to be very expensive. When Lehman Brothers collapsed, Germany did not feel rich enough to take on any additional obligations. When European finance ministers declared that no other systemically important financial institution would be allowed to fail, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, correctly reading the wishes of her electorate, declared that each member state should look after its own institutions. That was the start of a process of disintegration.<br />\n<br />\nAfter the Crash of 2008, the EU and the eurozone became increasingly dysfunctional. Prevailing conditions became far removed from those prescribed by the Maastricht Treaty, but treaty change became progressively more difficult, and eventually impossible, because it couldn&rsquo;t be ratified. The eurozone became the victim of antiquated laws; much-needed reforms could be enacted only by finding loopholes in them. That is how institutions became increasingly complicated, and electorates became alienated.<br />\n<br />\nThe rise of anti-EU movements further impeded the functioning of institutions. And these forces of disintegration received a powerful boost in 2016, first from Brexit, then from the election of Trump in the US, and on December 4 from Italian voters&rsquo; rejection, by a wide margin, of constitutional reforms.<br />\n<br />\nDemocracy is now in crisis. Even the US, the world&rsquo;s leading democracy, elected a con artist and would-be dictator as its president. Although Trump has toned down his rhetoric since he was elected, he has changed neither his behavior nor his advisers. His cabinet comprises incompetent extremists and retired generals."},{"pid":"33f124c4a3c08fbda508022584a009de8ab49690","tid":10646,"uid":50815,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-12-30T04:27:17.000Z","msg":"留名"},{"pid":"d778aebfd70e8ff83b969eb7b38db056258b2ac6","tid":10646,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-12-30T04:27:28.000Z","msg":"What lies ahead?<br />\nI am confident that democracy will prove resilient in the US. Its Constitution and institutions, including the fourth estate, are strong enough to resist the excesses of the executive branch, thus preventing a would-be dictator from becoming an actual one.<br />\n<br />\nBut the US will be preoccupied with internal struggles in the near future, and targeted minorities will suffer. The US will be unable to protect and promote democracy in the rest of the world. On the contrary, Trump will have greater affinity with dictators. That will allow some of them to reach an accommodation with the US, and others to carry on without interference. Trump will prefer making deals to defending principles. Unfortunately, that will be popular with his core constituency.<br />\n<br />\nI am particularly worried about the fate of the EU, which is in danger of coming under the influence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose concept of government is irreconcilable with that of open society. Putin is not a passive beneficiary of recent developments; he worked hard to bring them about. He recognized his regime&rsquo;s weakness: it can exploit natural resources but cannot generate economic growth. He felt threatened by &ldquo;color revolutions&rdquo; in Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere. At first, he tried to control social media. Then, in a brilliant move, he exploited social media companies&rsquo; business model to spread misinformation and fake news, disorienting electorates and destabilizing democracies. That is how he helped Trump get elected.<br />\n<br />\nThe same is likely to happen in the European election season in 2017 in the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. In France, the two leading contenders are close to Putin and eager to appease him. If either wins, Putin&rsquo;s dominance of Europe will become a fait accompli.<br />\n<br />\nI hope that Europe&rsquo;s leaders and citizens alike will realize that this endangers their way of life and the values on which the EU was founded. The trouble is that the method Putin has used to destabilize democracy cannot be used to restore respect for facts and a balanced view of reality.<br />\n<br />\nWith economic growth lagging and the refugee crisis out of control, the EU is on the verge of breakdown and is set to undergo an experience similar to that of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Those who believe that the EU needs to be saved in order to be reinvented must do whatever they can to bring about a better outcome."},{"pid":"129ed6014d789945b5d9cf11fcd7fc8287aa11fe","tid":10646,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2016-12-30T11:33:44.000Z","msg":"最新一期紫荊雜誌刊登了港澳辦主任王光亞先生的專訪後，很多傳媒記者問我的看法，我作出了以下的回應：<br />\n<br />\n我是本著愛國愛港、是非分明的心參選特首。我的首要任務是令香港重拾和諧，重回長遠發展正軌，促進香港穩定繁榮。本屆政府沒有客觀反映港人的訴求，所以我由第一天宣布參選就堅持，誠實地向中央反映重啟政改的要求，與「全面、準確、客觀地」如是反映是一致的。<br />\n<br />\n作為一位前法官，我亦會堅持法治精神，嚴守基本法。我將來當然亦會以「符合香港法律規定、符合香港情況的方法」，向市民清楚解釋政策和中央的觀點，會作為兩地之間的有效橋樑。<br />\n<br />\n我相信我的目標、態度和能力，都與王光亞主任所提出的吻合。<br />\n<br />\nI am a man of integrity who loves China and Hong Kong.

style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Trump takes office, vows an end to &lsquo;American carnage&rsquo;</span></em><br />\n<br />\nDonald John Trump was sworn in Friday as the nation&rsquo;s 45th president and delivered a fiery nationalist manifesto that promised a populist restoration by stripping power from Washington&rsquo;s elites and ending an era of &ldquo;American carnage.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nFraming his ascension as transformational and global in its impact, Trump delivered a dark inaugural address in which he pledged fealty to all Americans. But he made little overt attempt to soothe a nation still wounded from arguably the &shy;ugliest election season of modern times and signaled that he intends to govern as if waging a permanent political campaign.<br />\n<br />\nAs Trump addressed hundreds of thousands of supporters from the West Front of the Capitol &mdash; a crowd plainly more sparse and subdued than the record one for Barack Obama&rsquo;s historic inauguration eight years ago &mdash; scores of violent protesters clashed with police in the streets of downtown Washington.<br />\n<br />\nTrump reprised the central &shy;arguments of his candidacy and harshly condemned the condition of the country he now commands. He said communities had fallen into disrepair with rampant crime, chronic poverty, broken schools, stolen wealth and &ldquo;rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,&rdquo; Trump declared in his 16-minute address.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it&rsquo;s going to be only America first. America first.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nTrump immediately settled into the job, beginning a series of executive actions designed to systematically tear down Obama&rsquo;s legacy. He signed one executive order pertaining to the Affordable Care Act that White House press secretary Sean Spicer said would &ldquo;ease the burden of Obamacare as we transition to repeal and replace.&rdquo; Separately, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus planned to issue a memorandum to all federal departments and agencies ordering an immediate freeze on regulations.<br />\n<br />\nTrump signed the health-care &shy;order while seated at the Resolute Desk of the Oval Office, which had been redecorated with gold curtains (a change from Obama&rsquo;s crimson drapes). Busts of President Theodore Roosevelt and former British prime minister Winston Churchill were added to be displayed along with one of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.<br />\n<br />\nThe day of pageantry and ritual &mdash; orchestrated both to celebrate the installation of a new commander in chief and to symbolize a peaceful transfer of power &mdash; began with a church service and included a military review, a triumphant &shy;parade down Pennsylvania Avenue and evening balls.<br />\n<br />\nA tuxedo-clad Trump and wife Melania, who wore an off-the-shoulder white gown, performed their first dance to a cover of Frank Sinatra&rsquo;s &ldquo;My Way,&rdquo; with the president mouthing the lyrics.<br />\n<br />\nThe proceedings showcased the paradoxes of Trump. His inaugural speech, delivered in a light rain, presented a scathing indictment of the very lawmakers and former presidents who sat behind him on the dais. The president charged the &shy;entrenched powers in both political parties with exploiting &ldquo;the forgotten men and women of our country.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The time for empty talk is over,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;Now arrives the hour of action.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nYet moments later, retreating &shy;inside the Capitol for a signing ceremony of his first executive actions, the president was chummy with the congressional leaders from both parties who embody the established order he had vowed to destroy.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\"><a
