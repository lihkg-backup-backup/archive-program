Tejada,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI would like to ask you and your government to evacuate all citizens of your country from Hong Kong for the sake of their safety and health. More than 150,000 Filipino domestic helpers and other Filipino citizens are now exposed to tear-gas filled Hong Kong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the past 5 months, Hong Kong Police Force has fired nearly 10,000 tear gas bullets. Recently, they even fire more than 1,000 on one single day. Almost all districts of Hong Kong have experienced such insane tear gas shooting: commercial areas like Central and Wan Chai, tourist spots like Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui, and residential areas like Sha Tin, Tai Po and Tseung Kwan O, where most of the Filipino helpers work and live. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ingredients of tear gas bullets used by Hong Kong Police Force are not officially announced and no proper guidelines of handling patients exposed to tear gas are released by the Department of Health of Hong Kong. It is believed that O-Chlorobenzalmalononitrile (agent CS) is the main ingredient. When it is shot, it evaporates under heat and releases hazardous chemicals like hydrochloric acid (HCI), cyanide compounds and dioxins. According to a report of U.S. National Institutes of Health, these chemicals can harm immune system, endocrine system, central nervous system and reproductive ability. On Nov 13th, a reporter who frequently works on the protest frontline has been diagnosed with chloracne. There are also reports of babies showing signs of allergic reactions after being exposed to tear gas at home. As the stock of tear gas bullets made in the U.S. are used up, the bullets used now are made in China. The ingredients are even more mysterious and the damage done is even harder to estimate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother risk is the unreasonable arrest by the Hong Kong Police Force. From July until now, there are more than 4500 people arrested, including passers-by. A lot of them got abused and suffer from serious physical and mental damages, but they are avoided to have immediate proper diagnoses. They are even prevented from consulting their lawyers. The basic rights of the arrested are exploited. Not only Hong Kongers, but people of different races, journalists and tourists are arrested. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a Hong Kong citizen, I feel grateful about the hard work of Filipino domestic helpers and their devotion to the prosperity of Hong Kong, so I do not want them to get hurt. The unrest of Hong Kong has happened for more than 5 months. Hong Kong Government uses brutal police violence to intend to solve political issues. May I ask you again to evacuate all the citizens of your country under protection? Although the action will affect a lot of families and even the economy of Hong Kong, it is high time they went home without suffered from unnecessary damage. When time passes, the toxins accumulated in your citizens&rsquo; bodies increase. They will pass these toxins to their next generations. That definitely brings heavy load to the health care system and even economic damage to your country. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegards,<br />\r\nXXX<br />\r\nA Hong Konger supports friendship between Hong Kong and The Philippines."},{"pid":"e4c0ff61dc929602f741c61afdae6bb8de411639","tid":1743736,"uid":164091,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-21T10:47:48.000Z","msg":"呢個係印尼外傭組織版本<br />\r\natkihk_2000@yahoo.com<br />\r\natki.indonesia@gmail.com<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Sir/Madam,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI would like to ask you to help Indonesian domestic helpers to leave Hong Kong and ask Indonesian Government to evacuate all citizens from Hong Kong for the sake of their safety and health.
