As chants of &ldquo;Hong Kong independence&mdash;the only way out!&rdquo; started to drown out chants of &ldquo;stand with Uyghurs,&rdquo; I realized with horror that a rally ostensibly in solidarity with oppressed Uyghurs had been hijacked into becoming a propaganda event to promote a Hong Kong nation built on racial exclusion&mdash;possible first steps toward fascism.<br />\nDespite their links, the presumption that Hongkongers and Uyghurs share identical stakes in their struggles is misguided and harmful to those we are supposedly in solidarity with. It is, of course, important for us to help each other &mdash; for example, in resisting&nbsp;technologies&nbsp;of&nbsp;repression&nbsp;employed by the PRC in both regions. However, these experiences can only be effectively shared and utilized through relationships of genuine solidarity built on a mutual respect for the differences that divide us and, indeed, are produced by us."},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T12:09:56.000Z","msg":"As descendants of Han migrants from the mainland, Hongkongers play an indirect role in upholding the Han chauvinism that threatens Muslim communities in Xinjiang. Hongkongers must also not overlook the context of global Islamophobia, which is very much alive in Hong Kong. South Asian and Muslim Hongkongers have long endured racism and Islamophobia from their Han counterparts,&nbsp;including protesters. Before we can join our revolution to the struggles of others, we must first undertake &ldquo;a revolution of ourselves.&rdquo;<br />\nBut as with too much in this movement, any chance to think critically about the Uyghur solidarity rally and its ideological content was quickly overshadowed by chaotic&nbsp;scenes of police violence&nbsp;that brought the event to an abrupt and premature end. This only makes our reflection more necessary.&nbsp;<br />\nHong Kong&rsquo;s movement must overcome its instrumentalist and insular tendencies to clearly articulate the future it is fighting for&mdash;and what it is not. It must ask: who is our movement excluding when it always insists on unity, even with racist nationalists? How can we fight Chinese nationalism without resorting to a far-right Hong Kong nationalism?&nbsp;<br />\nA more powerful alternative is to recognize the hegemony of state and capital as the real enemy, and the basis for our allyship with oppressed people everywhere&mdash;including people in mainland China. We can stand with oppressed minorities in Xinjiang by learning about their politics and history, sharing resources, and challenging Islamophobic and racist institutions in Hong Kong &mdash;&nbsp;instead of making these reductive and ultimately opportunistic shows of solidarity. To paraphrase a common admonition between Hong Kong protesters: we must not treat as condoms those we recognize as our comrades."},{"pid":"e399f8160b810f5c61926552640217b8c1408e2f","tid":1933647,"uid":251732,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"c5a1ffb27099f81746bcfd41f00d4a38369f9b5f","tid":1933647,"uid":5103,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-19T12:03:12.000Z","msg":"<span
