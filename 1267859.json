My experience coding in my bedroom, working as a student, working in CS research, and working at a growing startup are all valuable kinds of experience. But they aren&rsquo;t all the same. Early in your career, you can learn 10x more in a supportive team in 1 year, than coding on your own (or with minimal feedback) for 5 years. If your code is never reviewed by other developers, you will not learn as fast as you can &ndash; by an enormous factor.<br />\n<br />\nThat&rsquo;s why mentors are so important, and the team you work with is worth so much more than a couple bucks in your paycheck. Don&rsquo;t accept a junior position where you&rsquo;ll be working alone, if you can help it! <strong><span style=\"color: red;\">And don&rsquo;t accept your first role (or, honestly, any role) based on salary alone.</span></strong> The team is where the real value is.<br />\n<br />\nI also learned that job titles don&rsquo;t &ldquo;make&rdquo; you anything. It&rsquo;s kind of like, being a CTO with a 5-person team is different than with a 50-person team or a 500-person team. The job and skills required are totally different, even if the title is identical. So just because I had a &ldquo;senior&rdquo; job title did not make me a senior engineer at all. Furthermore, hierarchical titles are inherently flawed, and difficult to compare cross-company. I learned it&rsquo;s important not to fixate on titles, or use them as a form of external validation.<br />\n<br />\n我知道搵工唔好用錢為首要一定會俾人屌，不過都Post出嚟<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<a href=\"https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/06/03/absolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmonicalent.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F06%2F03%2Fabsolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer%2F&d=FGEw0iwwiNltpS2R1LMyGtgc6rz%2Ba6PLwHdujBQ9FQE%3D&h=5d4f1ea3\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/06/03/absolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer/</a>"},{"pid":"968a701a235f59afe2a57e9fa2af5572c75f3990","tid":1267859,"uid":129573,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-30T12:25:05.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wink.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a6ad31746c24e453d17cccb97db10952b58a34ca","tid":1267859,"uid":3441,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"968a701a235f59afe2a57e9fa2af5572c75f3990","tid":1267859,"uid":129573,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-30T12:25:05.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wink.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-01T11:26:10.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"bf2d37dad05112026bf7933e7fcd0b62cc075164","tid":1267859,"uid":226562,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T04:10:04.000Z","msg":"diu 香港啲老闆叫個 intern 幫佢做十幾萬一個project都夠膽死<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a513f1b7281104b5c3835b19c1dba1103f5e5347","tid":1267859,"uid":130565,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T04:42:26.000Z","msg":"通常D code 都好難maintain  or maintain 唔到<br />\n因為我intern個陣都寫過<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4ca03050a47a72256125a6af7b9a9ccb4b2f43e8","tid":1267859,"uid":226562,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"a513f1b7281104b5c3835b19c1dba1103f5e5347","tid":1267859,"uid":130565,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T04:42:26.000Z","msg":"通常D code 都好難maintain  or maintain 唔到<br />\n因為我intern個陣都寫過<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-05T04:51:16.000Z","msg":"香港嗰啲係咁架啦<br />\nsales 壓價<br />\nprogrammer 就做到傻<br />\nmain 條毛咩"},{"pid":"a546aabc72ff8f0fea7188cd5f0b434e850d0bef","tid":1267859,"uid":53406,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-21T05:36:33.000Z","msg":"Not applicable in Hong Kong"}]}
