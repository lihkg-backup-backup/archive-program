She even had put her self interest more than to the rational news to influence the progress of China. Aren&rsquo;t her children chinese nationals? . I heard of her bised journalism justifying China every time in past her post. BBC just should have corresponded with those chinese government&rsquo;s traineed English speaking flunkies.<br />\n<br />\nSo, with her new regular post back in BBC headquarter, did she say how much she gets paid or at least, it was equal pay? So she could take the new post?<br />\n<br />\nShe is a just making fake headlines on behalf of BBC as if it lets people speak up, while not changing."},{"pid":"b31372cfd23e0f18018215f3f665c144eba8a473","tid":522995,"uid":17103,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-01-08T05:58:49.000Z","msg":"係咪著名比中共入晒既 BBC China? <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n佢有講中東, 北美比佢高, 但係係 BBC China 佢個位有無第二個男人一齊做?<br />\n<br />\n如果唔係, 點比?<br />\n<br />\n呢 D 女人真係越黎越玩死女人, 咁搞法 HR 本來專請無賓周既優勢都無埋"},{"pid":"a54f1941ecc8bc3568d94efd52091fb30b1454d6","tid":522995,"uid":11148,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"b31372cfd23e0f18018215f3f665c144eba8a473","tid":522995,"uid":17103,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-01-08T05:58:49.000Z","msg":"係咪著名比中共入晒既 BBC China? <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n佢有講中東, 北美比佢高, 但係係 BBC China 佢個位有無第二個男人一齊做?<br />\n<br />\n如果唔係, 點比?<br />\n<br />\n呢 D 女人真係越黎越玩死女人, 咁搞法 HR 本來專請無賓周既優勢都無埋"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-08T06:13:45.000Z","msg":"好事黎,班女人最好不停搞事,等老細hr覺得請個有j好過請有閪 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
