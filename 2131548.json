In accordance with animal law, if your pet is a social animal, you must have at least two of them living together. Most citizens honor it. According to the veterinarians, you should clip your bunny's nails every month. Rabbits are compatible with most other pets if you teach thr other pets well. At Tokyo University, researchers conducted an experiment last year and this morning where they showed they coild bond a <span class=\"gold\">rabbit</span> 🐇with a <span class=\"gold\">dog</span> 🐕🦮🐕&zwj;🦺🐩in a short period of time. They were happy to find their results were compatible with the results of the study undertaken last year. Hereafter, Joe had his bunnies and Akita living together. He believes he'll continue living with them in the hereafter. You can take the House Rabbit Journals for free and read them at your leisure. Joe speaks five languages fluently. He told me 'Because it has a jargonistic tone, instead of writing &quot;as per our previous conversation&quot;, we can simply write &quot;as we discussed&quot; or &quot;as discussed&quot;. Instead of writing &quot;as per your request&quot;, we can just write &quot;as you requested&quot;. Instead of saying &quot;as per our agreement&quot;, we can simply say &quot;as we agreed&quot;. Rather than say &quot;please find attached the receipt&quot;, &quot;we can just say &quot;attached is the receipt&quot; or &quot;enclosed is the receipt&quot; or &quot;I've attached the receipt&quot; or &quot;I've enclosed the receipt&quot;. Rather than say &quot;i enclose herewith two documents&quot;, it's more natural to say &quot;enclosed are two documents&quot; or &quot;attached are two documents&quot; or &quot;I've attached two documents&quot; or &quot;I've enclosed two documents&quot;. Instead of saying &quot;here is the report for your perusal&quot;, it's more natural to say &quot;here is the report for your review&quot;. Instead of saying &quot;please return the form at your earliest convenience&quot;, we can say &quot;please return the form by next Friday&quot;.'"},{"pid":"e0d3e13b3307c34f7aaf097b745f4eed79015bee","tid":2131548,"uid":205516,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"1bc5d75083068e3e5b56150ab874f6b1228929de","tid":2131548,"uid":303864,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-07-31T01:38:03.000Z","msg":"雖然唔係好關事 但係有冇人帶帶龜去移民既經歷 因為遲啲去澳洲但好撚鐘意隻龜想帶埋去 有冇人知澳洲既安排係點 或者有親身經驗可以分享下<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-02T12:42:11.000Z","msg":"澳洲唔俾任何爬蟲入口<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/no.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
