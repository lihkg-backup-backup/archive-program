Truthfulness compels me to. I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country&rsquo;s most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.<br />\n<br />\nI suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it. Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service.<br />\n<br />\nI helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912 (where have I heard that name before?). I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested. During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room would say, a swell racket. Looking back on it, I feel that I could have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n今天，西方大財團仍然為毒販和恐怖分子洗黑錢，這就是民主法治的世界<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yipes.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\nNo one from Wachovia went to jail &ndash; and, said Woods at the time of the settlement: &quot;These are the proceeds of murder and misery in Mexico, and of drugs sold around the world.
