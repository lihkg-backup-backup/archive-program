As the ceremony approaches on Feb. 28, the categories have been analyzed to determine what they mean for the awards season. Several nominees have already made history, but with final voting taking place and due back to Ernst &amp; Young&rsquo;s accounting firm by Feb. 23, many films and performances could be record-breakers or trendsetters if they are selected as winners. Read all the records that could be set with each set of nominees for the Globes on Variety. With just under 30 days until the Oscar nominations, set to be announced on March 15, the race continues to take shape, possibly presenting more twists and turns over the next few weeks.<br />\n<br />\nChlo&eacute; Zhao&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nomadland&rdquo; is back on top for best picture, with Aaron Sorkin&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Trial of the Chicago 7&rdquo; and Lee Isaac Chung&rsquo;s &ldquo;Minari&rdquo; rounding out the top three spots. Emerald Fennell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Promising Young Woman&rdquo; is still catching on, with some industry people believing it has a chance to win it in the end for Focus Features. Not the wildest of theories. Regina King&rsquo;s &ldquo;One Night in Miami&rdquo; rounds out the top five contenders. Still, the film has always felt like something that either catches on significantly in all the expected categories or ends up a nomination day underperforming, such as films like Ava DuVernay&rsquo;s &ldquo;Selma&rdquo; (2017) or Sean Penn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Into the Wild&rdquo; (2007)."},{"pid":"66fb22987ceb893a98d84ea6dd9f6913646d4674","tid":2416638,"uid":18012,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-02-21T08:37:19.000Z","msg":"杯葛奧斯卡啦仲睇<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n成班仆街偽人<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
