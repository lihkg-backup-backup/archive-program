The HEPA-filtration system used a prefilter screen, a bag filter (Eurovent [EU] 8 rating), and a HEPA filter (EU13 rating). The low-cost-filtration system contained mosquito netting (prefilter), 2 fiberglass furnace filters, and 2 electrostatic furnace filters. Bag filtration involved the use of a filter rated EU8 and a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) of 14. The 95%-DOP, 0.3-&mu;m-filtration system involved a pleat-in-pleat V-bank disposable filter with a 95% efficiency rating for particles 0.3 &mu;m or greater in diameter and ratings of EU9 and MERV 15. No form of intervention was used in the control group. The experimental facilities consisted of 2 chambers connected by a 1.3-m-long duct containing the treatments. Recipient pigs, housed in chamber 2, were exposed to artificial aerosols created by a mechanically operated mister containing modified live PRRSV vaccine located in chamber 1. Aerosol transmission of PRRSV occurred in 0 of the 10 HEPA-filtration replicates, 2 of the 10 bag-filtration replicates, 4 of the 10 low-cost-filtration replicates, 0 of the 10 95%-DOP, 0.3-&mu;m-filtration replicates, and all 10 of the control replicates. Using a similar approach, we further evaluated the HEPA- and 95%-DOP, 0.3-&mu;m-filtration systems. Infection was not observed in any of the 76 HEPA-filtration replicates but was observed in 2 of the 76 95%-DOP, 0.3-&mu;m replicates and 42 of the 50 control replicates. Although the difference between the 95%-DOP, 0.3-&mu;m and control replicates was significant (P &lt; 0.0005), so was the level of failure of the 95%-DOP, 0.3-&mu;m system (P = 0.02). In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, some methods of air filtration were significantly better than others in reducing aerosol transmission of PRRSV, and HEPA filtration was the only system that completely prevented transmission.<br />\n<br />\n當然Setting會對efficiecny有影響...<br />\n<br />\n4 - 洗衣服<br />\n<br />\n-   病毒不耐熱<br />\nThis would indicate that the virus is more stable than the known human coronaviruses under these conditions.

In suspension, HCoV-229E gradually lost its infectivity completely while SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for up to 9 days; in the dried state, survival times were 24 h versus 6 days. Thermal inactivation at 56 degrees C was highly effective in the absence of protein, reducing the virus titre to below detectability; however, the addition of 20% protein exerted a protective effect resulting in residual infectivity. If protein-containing solutions are to be inactivated, heat treatment at 60 degrees C for at least 30 min must be used.<br />\n<br />\nHeat inactivation of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus<br />\nThe culture supernatants of the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were submitted to three temperatures over time and tested for infectivity by TCID50 method on Vero E6 cells. At 56&deg;C, almost 25 minutes were necessary to reduce the initial titre by 4 log10. Increasing temperature to 65&deg;C had a strong negative effect on viral infectivity as virucidy dropped significantly to 1 minute. On the contrary, no significant decrease in titre was observed after 2 hours at 25&deg;C. These data might be useful in establishing biosafety measures in laboratories against MERS-CoV.<br />\n<br />\n總結<br
