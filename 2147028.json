so-called US sanctions shameless and despicable<br />\n************************************************************<br />\n     The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has today (August 8) vehemently criticised the so-called &quot;sanctions&quot; by the United States (US) Government against 11 officials of the Central People's Government and the HKSAR Government as shameless and despicable.<br />\n      <br />\n     &quot;Imposed under the so-called Office of Foreign Assets Control's Specially Designated Nationals List of the US Department of the Treasury, the latest US Government measure represents blatant and barbaric interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China (PRC), using Hong Kong as a pawn in its ploy to create troubles in China-US relationship, out of self-serving interests of some US politicians,&quot; a Government spokesman said.<br />\n      <br />\n     &quot;Taking advantage of anti-government riots in Hong Kong since June last year, the US Congress and the White House have passed successive laws and pronounced executive order targeting the HKSAR under the pretext of human rights, democracy and autonomy.  It should be obvious to and resented by many people, locally and around the world, that the US acts are displaying double standards and hypocrisy, let alone blatantly breaching international laws and basic norms governing international relations. <br />\n      <br />\n     &quot;Hong Kong is an inalienable part of the PRC.
