Despite that 1/7 of the population of Hong Kong have expressed their opposition against the act on the street, the government did not show any intention to suspend the law. Therefore, the protestors organised another strike on Wednesday. The strikers were only equipped with helmets, masks and umbrellas for protection while the police srtiked, opened fire and deployed tear gas to unarmed men and women, boys and girls, old and young. <br />\n<br />\nWhat's extradition law? <br />\nWhat's the impact? <br />\nIt's a law which allows the police to send any suspect in HK to China courts for trial, sentences and punishment. However, unlike in HK and any other countries in the world, laws, freedom, human rights and justice are not appreciated in China, where people would face no fair judgement and be unfairly punished. One can be put in jail for years long just because of a video or a speech about democracy. If the law pass, the freedom of speech would vanish in HK. Whoever speaks against China, or just tells the truth would be arrested, and may spend the entire life in jail. If it passes, I could be in jail for example. And this applies to everyone in HK, including every single foreigner studying, working or travelling in HK. <br />\n<br />\nWhat can I do for help? <br />\n1. Share this to anyone you know, spread this information as wide as possible, let everyone knows what we are doing and how unfair it is. <br />\n<br />\n2. Write and send links or videos to the presses and journalists to let them tell the world. <br />\n<br />\n3. Kindly sign a petition or write an email, a letter to your government to express your concern, to encourage them to speak about it, so that we are not alone and all nations are by the side of us, justice, humans rights and freedom. <br />\n<br />\n4. If there is any protest about it in your city, join the march. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBut what can we and the government accutally do. <br />\n<br />\nGovernment:<br />\n1. Stop and forbid weapon supplies for China and Hong Kong. (as long as they have and we don't, we can't fight against them) <br />\n<br />\n2. Suspend the citizenship of the Hong Kong senior officials.<br />\nForbid the access of Hong Kong officials. <br />\n<br />\nUniversities, <br />\n1. Stop all fundings and academic activities to China's universities or organisations. <br />\n<br />\nCitizens, you, <br />\n1. Avoid buying any China's products, to apply pressure economically on both China and Hong Kong. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n事源係好多外國朋友都有關心香港咩事，WhatsApp 都寫左幾萬字，所以都要有個系統話比人知同埋方便人傳消息。<br />\n<br />\n好多人睇住咖，加油呀，唔好放棄呀"},{"pid":"2511cd4c9493effd73806f008789befce623139b","tid":1224705,"uid":62133,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-15T05:06:15.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"491ce4ae00def686b218f36053b7968328edc62d","tid":1224705,"uid":251581,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-15T05:14:25.000Z","msg":"正 <br />\n一路諗緊如果用英文<br />\n解釋逃犯條例 <br />\n應該點講<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ba8bd81659d748aedd2348c8b349e89f37137437","tid":1224705,"uid":62133,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"491ce4ae00def686b218f36053b7968328edc62d","tid":1224705,"uid":251581,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-15T05:14:25.000Z","msg":"正 <br />\n一路諗緊如果用英文<br />\n解釋逃犯條例 <br />\n應該點講<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-15T05:21:11.000Z","msg":"我d英文都唔係好得<br />\n我會整返德文版<br />\n<br />\n如果內容經巴打睇過ok<br />\n我會請外國朋友寫埋意法西加泰版<br />\n<br />\n求大家幫下手<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"06a8456650d4722cf5c9c37c49a79293c66d3953","tid":1224705,"uid":62133,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-15T05:40:23.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"00f18e17b37f5b9c4afec83dc40abbecb978e634","tid":1224705,"uid":62133,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-15T05:55:22.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"8ef8205049d89bef62e747ac7f95a4f4369261b3","tid":1224705,"uid":62133,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-15T07:17:35.000Z","msg":"推"},{"pid":"8e0558086555a33030b5e58137a42685eb00e71c","tid":1224705,"uid":62133,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-15T08:22:49.000Z","msg":"推<br />\n點解無人幫推<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ad9e80040014f102975fc68daf3e5a9e776a7a79","tid":1224705,"uid":250104,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-15T14:20:51.000Z","msg":"推"}]}
