The promoter has announced that a rematch between shane and oscar is in the works. During their first fight, shane started off the fight with a right cross followed by a left uppercut which knocked him out. Apparently oscar suffered a minor injury which took the edge of his performance. Both are fantastic fighters but in a rematch I think oscar will eshe the match. The fans are excited about the rematch but oscar has upped the ante by demanding a salary twice as much. Hopefully it'll eventually happen. John will be fighting in december. If he tests positive for steroids again the fans will be terribly disappointed in him. The promoter will also be bitterly disappointed with him since last year three of his tests came back positive. As a result he was suspended for a year. However if he loses because of ring rust due to having been suspended for a year the fans including me will be deeply disappointed by the result. My brother who's a fan of him will also be terribly disappointed at the fact that he loses due to ring rust because of having been suspended. Last year I was bitterly disappointed to find his fight with Dan was overturned to a no contest. The fans too were deeply disappointed to hear he would be suspended. Four years ago john gought matt in which he was disqualified for landing illegal downward elbows. Therefore he lost by disqualification at which I was a bit disappointed. Two years later he used yet another illegal move in a fight against anthony which was a knee to the grounded opponent's head. The referee could've stopped the match which would've been a cheap triumph for Anthony for fortunately he didn't. Instead he called for a timeout to let him have a rest. John said in the post-fight press conference that when the referee called a timeout he immediately had flashbacks of his match with Matt. The chairman sometimes pretends to be a fighter's friend but will sell him down the river the moment it makes financial sense for him. He pretended like he was Tito's friend but once he was past his prime he sold him down the river by dismissing him. The sport used to be big in japan. Now it's most popular in the united states but not that popular in the global scheme of things."},{"pid":"9e4b698562ab4285955fe582ef6f4cc02e2bc3d7","tid":341238,"uid":197098,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-24T10:10:55.000Z","msg":"The promoter has announced that a rematch between chris and paul is in the works.
