The war is not on the streets of HK, it is in the world's media.  The battles you conduct with the police are important, they are fuel to keep the attention of the world's media.

In fact, I expect they would be quite happy if you did as it would give them justification to eliminate you.  They don't care how much damage they cause to HK in the process of eliminating you.  They've build shiny new cities bigger than HK in a few years.  They've got lots of people willing to live there.

You need world opinion on your side.  If the CCP won't back down, you need to get them to roll the PLA in without reasonable justification.  That will keep world opinion.  But, you must NOT fight the PLA.<br />\n<br />\nYou do not need weapons beyond what protesters typically have.  Do not kill the police.  Do not kill the PLA soldiers.  If you do, you will lose the war, you will lose HK.
