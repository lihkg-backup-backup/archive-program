Why not? My friend Josh brings his tub of protein every time he goes to Netherland. Josh is a gym membership salesman who'll be making a follow-up call and sending a follow-up email to a customer who's interested in joining the ten year membership. I used to work in a gym and whenever a customer paid a visit to the gym I always followed it up with a call or an email. Some of my colleagues followed it up with a visit to the customer. My friend Rika who wants to join his gym had a meeting yesterday and a follow-up has been scheduled for tomorrow. She's also writing a follow-up to the acclaimed &quot;The invisible man&quot; so she's so busy that she won't have time to pay a follow-up visit to the gym for the time being. Therefore I handed her the membership agreement for Josh instead and will follow up with her in the next couple days. The membership costs eight hundred dollars a month which is well worth it for the whole range of facilities you can use. They sell a tub of whey protein for four hundred dollars which is well worth if as it's normally two times more expensive. The cost of a tub of soy protein has edged down from five hundred dollars to four hundred and ninety dollars while the cost of creatine has edged higher by ten dollars. The cost of milk protein has edged up from four hundred to four hundred and twenty dollars whereas the cost of casein protein has edged lower by five dollars. Last Wednesday Rika complained that she was treated badly at Starbucks. As a result a barista provided a referral to a senior staff member who in turn referred her case to the manager. She'll follow up with the manager on the case to be sure that it'll be dealt with seriously. In addition she's been suffering from a stomachache so I gave her a referral to a gastroenterologist. Recently she posted on an online forum and suggested building an art gallery so as to boost tourism which was supported by many people on the forum. They asked the forum administrator for a referral to a district councilor. They'll follow up with the district councilor on the matter being discussed. I too will follow the issue up. His suggestion of building an art museum so as to boost tourism is deemed appropriate. I had my personal training in the gym this morning and was soaking wet. Then I soaked in a jacuzzi. The gym is situated beside the jacuzzi where you can see the inside of the gym clearly. I saw a slender guy lift a two pound dumbbell for all he was worth but still couldn't complete the exercise lol. I enjoy hitting the gym and I know my personal trainer is worth her salt as I'm making good progress with my physique. She's a vivacious, in-your-face woman who's sometimes too honest for her own good. I dislike going to Physical Fitness because the salespeople there are way too in-your-face."}]}
