In his head, he is moving to the LaLiga side having accepted their personal terms and has even spoken to Diego Simeone. The Portuguese attacking midfielder is hoping that a deal can be agreed next week. <br />\n<br />\nAtl&eacute;tico Madrid have offered &euro;15 million with &euro;10 million in potential add-ons as reported by AS. The Portuguese side are optimistic after Real Betis signed William Carvalho for more than was initially proposed. Sporting Club are looking for between &euro;45 million and &euro;50 million for the 23-year-old.<br />\n<br />\nGiven the situation at Sporting Club, however, Atl&eacute;tico feel like they have the advantage in negotiations. The player unilaterally cancelled his contract with the club and Atl&eacute;tico do not want to pay over the odds. An amicable exit has been tried but in case, they await a decision by FIFA on Gelson and other players who did the same with their contracts. <br />\n<br />\nGelson is currently on holidays and Portugal have been knocked out of the World Cup since June 30. This weekend, it will be 21 days since Gelson has played and that is the number of days given by Atl&eacute;tico's technical staff for players who played at the World Cup. If all works out, Gelson will be available next week.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://en.as.com/en/2018/07/18/football/1531913772_113769.html\"
