Over the last three months, at least ten people have lost their lives fighting for our rights and freedom, and the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) have arrested over 1200 protesters and they have suffered from the police&rsquo;s abuse of violence. From many video evidences, we have witnessed how the police would randomly attack and arrest any passerby, and forge false evidences by putting weapons and gas masks into their backpacks. <br />\n<br />\nPresumption of innocence has always been the fundamental principle in Hong Kong&rsquo;s judicial system. Yet the HKSAR Government and the HKPF have shown otherwise. Citizens would be treated as protesters simply based on the colour of their clothing and ages, not to mention the fact that even if they really were protestors the Police do not have the right to brutally attack and torture them. We believe that many have been wrongfully charged, some of them have had their bails denied. The prosecution relies solely on the evidence that the police provide, yet when the police are so corrupted that they would do anything to bend facts and truths to fit their rhetorics, the right to a fair trial is no longer respected. In order to reinstall the faith of people in Hong Kong&rsquo;s human rights and the judicial system, the wrongful charges to these innocent people must be revoked.<br />\n<br />\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is still trying to fake a peaceful scene before the National Day of the PRC on October 1st, hence Hong Kong has yet been burnt down to ashes despite all the chaos that are happening on a daily basis. However, it can be foreseen that after October 1st, the CCP will relentlessly carry out large-scale political persecutions against Hong Kong people just as how they had purged the Uyghurs. We are under a humanitarian crisis outcry, we are devastated, yet we have not lost hope. We have faith that the democratic countries over the world would not stay out of the situation and watch these with folded arms, we still have faith that the liberal world will come to rescue, protect and liberate the &ldquo;West Berlin in the 21st century&rdquo; from the despotic oppression. Hong Kong people are currently collecting evidences of human rights violation by the CCP and HKSAR officials, including HKPF and those pro-Beijing lawmakers, for your reference to see who have been trying to demolish the &ldquo;One Country, Two Systems&rdquo; principle.<br />\n<br />\nWe believe that this is not just a battle for Hong Kong alone, by helping to defend Hong Kong&rsquo;s autonomy, democracy, freedom and human rights, this would show the world that these are the values that we all hold dear. Hong Kong look forward to the day when freedom and democracy prevail. <br />\n<br />\nSincerely,<br />\n<br />\n（           ）"},{"pid":"c9b3b23ac230b1e26054856c741a3161e1b8f26a","tid":1572215,"uid":62011,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-15T15:28:14.000Z","msg":"將香港問題拉入國際層面。"},{"pid":"96523b00911e484a9b39493ef017f61a243e8155","tid":1572215,"uid":62011,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-15T15:28:38.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/972393926144079/posts/2647424808640974/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F972393926144079%2Fposts%2F2647424808640974%2F&d=Vjn4Al6Q2mdpb7%2BU1BdqDu4Wvb5rKEvwepesSl%2FR16E%3D&h=adde79ee\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/972393926144079/posts/2647424808640974/</a>"},{"pid":"0dc60bce411093c0a28ed3507285244795e56eca","tid":1572215,"uid":62011,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-15T15:28:48.000Z","msg":"唔好放棄啊。"},{"pid":"dcaadbc31fdddeb62b7c4fe99186a7fd8ae71a08","tid":1572215,"uid":300478,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-15T15:32:02.000Z","msg":"推唔郁啊<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"99dee245688f005f6bd5b5924a6ed8556fdf1c6b","tid":1572215,"uid":49178,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-15T15:37:32.000Z","msg":"推<br />\n例如呢"},{"pid":"d4c27226e96828f8fe422d8c78bfbe5352cd3944","tid":1572215,"uid":193475,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-15T16:33:30.000Z","msg":"推呀"}]}
