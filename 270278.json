SpaceX began launch operations there in February, and has now flown six rockets from the seaside launch complex.<br />\n<br />\nThe Falcon 9&rsquo;s first stage engines shut down and deployed the rocket&rsquo;s second stage more than 40 miles (65 kilometers) over the Atlantic Ocean, then the booster activated nitrogen cold gas thrusters to flip around and fly tail first.<br />\n<br />\nWhile the upper stage accelerated into orbit, three of the Merlin&rsquo;s first stage engines ignited to begin maneuvers to return the first stage to Landing Zone 1, and two more braking burns slowed the 156-foot-tall (47-meter) for a smooth vertical touchdown around 9 miles (14 kilometers) from where the mission started.<br />\n<br />\nThe landing marked the fifth time SpaceX has returned a rocket booster to Cape Canaveral &mdash; all successful. The commercial launch company has recovered 11 rockets in 16 tries overall, a figure that includes landings at sea."},{"pid":"c2e25046aeb98859efc198ecc4efcf9914d9501e","tid":270278,"uid":83623,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T14:51:30.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ab3eeb41edee16fa1b3d3e717088bce012b29f88","tid":270278,"uid":61050,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T15:05:00.000Z","msg":"Musk bb真係好叻豬<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/love.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5ca1717857297f980596753caecc91ca980e9d77","tid":270278,"uid":25424,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T15:28:46.000Z","msg":"商業化<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a19d923e63080972ca9ff3a181cca09e2f94ece9","tid":270278,"uid":2054,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T15:30:01.000Z","msg":"Tesla撈埋太空船<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f44008973e16085b317ee941ef2978f7970babd4","tid":270278,"uid":26506,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T15:32:35.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>Tesla撈埋太空船<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n.... <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/surprise.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/chicken.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"60f0b8c29d31c345ede9f2c80a99e2e42a83636a","tid":270278,"uid":83623,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-04T15:42:07.000Z","msg":"回收已經routine 化咗<br />\n下一次任務會係第二次重用第一級(節)"},{"pid":"575e4be5be5d8c8a4d5d37a055d614c23d029f06","tid":270278,"uid":33787,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-05T06:15:28.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"1e056948cd3097eeddf08e10d6e1e3e3705e957c","tid":270278,"uid":83623,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-05T06:32:02.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>真係好快手<br />\nT+8分鐘已經land番支野</blockquote><br />\nbooster flip 個時間不停加快<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n今次味完全定位已經開引擎"},{"pid":"6ce25d58fde07c72f1726fee4390ef59e9d09c61","tid":270278,"uid":39750,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-05T07:39:17.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f2b105c79ab8c65ac54b35c85d3f2011b04eebcd","tid":270278,"uid":57677,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-05T07:41:47.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"3455d1f7a18b4cd535e555ac7a1addc59be8a707","tid":270278,"uid":33263,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-05T08:40:11.000Z","msg":"<blockquote><blockquote>Tesla撈埋太空船<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\n.... <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/surprise.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/chicken.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></blockquote><br />\nSpaceX仲未上市<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/biggrin.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 如果真係上既話，<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
