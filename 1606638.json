Serious Injury of Journalist by Police Projectile.<br />\n<br />\nOn 29th September 2019, Ms Veby Indah a Hong Kong journalist for an Indonesian Language Hong Kong publication was seriously injured by a projectile fired from a police 12 Gauge Shotgun.  <br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: gold;\">The projectile is believed to be a bean bag round (Type 12 Gauge Drag Stabilised Round, with 40g projectile and velocity speed of 270fps/82mps) or Rubber Bullet (12 gauge Rubber Fin Rocket ( Direct Fire) , High Velocity (ALS120HV) with velocity of 650fps (198m/s), casings of which were found near the scene .</span></strong></span><br />\n<br />\nAt the time Ms Veby was reporting on the protests in Hong Kong for her publication.  She was situated on the elevated footbridge linking HK Immigration Tower to Wanchai MTR Exit A4.  She was wearing a high visibility vest with &lsquo;Press&rsquo; markings, a protective helmet with &lsquo;Press&rsquo; markings. Her press credentials were displayed from a lanyard round her neck. She was standing with other members of the press on the footbridge at the top of the stairs. They were similarly dressed in high visibility vests and helmets with &lsquo;Press&rsquo; markings. They were not intermingled with protestors. <br />\n<br />\nMoments before the shooting, police officers including the shooter, had been at the top of the stairs where the group of press were gathered. The shot was fired by the officer from a position half way up the stairs to the footbridge in the direction of the group of press. <br />\n<br />\nThe projectile struck Ms Veby&rsquo;s protective eye goggles from a distance of approximately 12 meters. The impact caused severe injury to her right eye, a cut near her right eye which required stitches and injury to her left eye. <br />\n<br />\nShe received emergency medical treatment at the scene and was subsequently admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Hospital in Chai Wan. The injury to her right eye is such that doctors cannot presently assess the full extent of the damage to her right eye or provide a prognosis. It is anticipated that doctors will be able to carry out a scan on her right eye in approximately 7 days to be able to better assess the full extent of her injuries."},{"pid":"c28927a508c18f902ba648ac86f9ce121de672c6","tid":1606638,"uid":65139,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-30T15:27:21.000Z","msg":"Commenting on the circumstances, Mr Vidler who is representing Ms Veby, said:-<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;This projectile was fired at a potentially lethal distance and from a low angle where the impact could only be on the upper body or head. This was in breach of manufacturer guidelines, any conceivable professional instruction and international norms.  Ms Veby and the press around her were also clearly identifiable as members of the press and were the only people in the officer&rsquo;s field of vision. They posed no threat to the police.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n &ldquo;Ms Veby is lucky to be alive and but for her protective goggles, she would definitely have been blinded. At present, very substantial visual impairment still remains a possibility&rdquo;.  <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Responsibly for this incident lies squarely with the Commissioner of Police who has failed to control the increasingly reckless behaviour of some of his officers, and with the officer who fired at Ms Veby. <strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"color: gold;\">She will be filing criminal complaints against the Commissioner of Police and the officer. She will also be filing civil proceedings to seek redress.&rdquo;  </span></span></strong><br />\n<br />\nMs Veby is too unwell at present to give press interviews but takes this opportunity to thank the medical staff at Pamela Youde Nethersole Hospital, members of her church, her employer publication and the Hong Kong Journalists Association for their care and support.<br />\n<br />\nMedia enquiries should be directed to Michael Vidler of Vidler &amp; Co Solicitors."},{"pid":"28a967064431134a40bd36b793d3bd8dfdb6869d","tid":1606638,"uid":65139,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-30T15:27:58.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/112018101490/posts/10156880335981491?sfns=mo\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F112018101490%2Fposts%2F10156880335981491%3Fsfns%3Dmo&d=Rx4KuutU7IQQNt32%2FBGh6iuJrf%2BHou%2F%2F5XtIYOa%2FW4Y%3D&h=d8b30a88\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/112018101490/posts/10156880335981491?sfns=mo</a>"},{"pid":"36515b5bfdb0235322eeb692d5abd636ab78713d","tid":1606638,"uid":14918,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-30T15:28:43.000Z","msg":"香港市民支持印印"},{"pid":"c3f4fd49e74700599097d244df415ddcef3806d1","tid":1606638,"uid":290118,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-30T15:29:27.000Z","msg":"等睇律師行被人淋紅油<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"362ed42c77a3b9bfcb2b5fe94feabb9c7c9045c4","tid":1606638,"uid":83344,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-30T15:33:51.000Z","msg":"香港記者俾人射完頭就剩係記協出嚟up兩句"},{"pid":"e6fafd3fa2c8bf4e97629c1c92ae6f05d605748d","tid":1606638,"uid":226569,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-30T15:34:06.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/wine.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d67c6e95dfc018ddfb23e5f8945ba76c99fc6fe6","tid":1606638,"uid":326746,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-30T15:34:31.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d146ecf6d8b00ed42b68d10247119d556d14a641","tid":1606638,"uid":4661,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-30T15:34:45.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
