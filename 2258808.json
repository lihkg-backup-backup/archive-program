It involves 8 steps in total.<br />\n<br />\nTo begin with, the flour was reserved in a storage tank with silos which was then put into a mixer with water and oil. With the help of rollers, the mixture was then released onto the dough sheets for flattening after the mixing procedure. Afterwards, It was cut into stripes and compressed into a noodles discs. <br />\n<br />\nWhen the stripes were compressed into discs, it was sent to be cooked with oil.  The next step for the noodles discs were to be carried out for the drying process after dipping into oil. Next, the noodles were put into separate cups with ingredients added on such as vegetables and spices. At last, each cup would be added with a label and sealing which were then sent to the department stores and supermarkets respectively for supply.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Task 2</strong> - 278 words<br />\n<em><strong>Some say that advertising is extremely successful at persuading us to buy things. Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it. <br />\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.</strong></em><br />\n<br />\nIt is common to see that advertising the products online or in newspaper is one of the contributing factors for the profit achievement and every companies are paying millions of dollars to promote their products. While some customers think it boots their shopping intentions, some would ignore the boring advertisement. This essay will talk about both sides and I believe advertising can drive people shopping.<br />\n<br />\nAdvertising can create imagination for people to have a better life. It is obvious that advertising the high-technology products generates lots of fantasies to the customers. For example, the IPhone 4 advertisement built up a amazing story which created an illusion that having a smartphone makes your life easier. Indeed, this advertisement made millions of people got crazy and therefore the product broke the sales record among all the competitors.<br />\n<br />\nWithout creativity, however, some advertisements are dimmed to be dull to most of the customers. When the advertising strategies are the same pattern among the companies, it not only cannot catch people attention, but it will make people sick of these spams. They would rather buy some software applications to block all the adverts online than give their patience on few second advertisements. <br />\n<br />\nWhile advertising seems to be good for companies to promote their products, companies should pay attention to what people need most in order to avoid themselves from trapping into money-hole. Advertisement is one of the great tools to spread your ideas to the world and interact with people. If a company realize the importance of creativity and the values of the products to customers, it will gain much respect and reputation for itself, driving people to buy their products.<br
