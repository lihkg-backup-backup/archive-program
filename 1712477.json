《告國際港人書》","createTime":"2019-11-12T14:29:22.000Z","updateTime":"2019-11-15T14:13:57.000Z","uid":251732,"like":355,"dislike":1,"uniUserReply":59,"replies":[{"pid":"c2e0eca4242a09f3f2f4ed9eb406f45dc58a7af4","tid":1712477,"uid":251732,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-12T14:29:22.000Z","msg":"近呢兩晚嘅黑警鎮壓，都已經正式宣告不對等內戰嘅開始， 特別係而家仍然進行緊嘅暴大戰役， 都顯示林鄭月娥為首嘅赤納粹傀儡政府，以及佢哋嘅背後走狗同支持者，都唔再視香港嘅年輕人為人類看待， 並用盡佢哋所能去消滅過下代人，從而延續赤納粹嘅政治生命。<br />\n<br />\n故此，我喺呢度有幾句說話，想同喺海外進行文宣嘅手足，同身在海外嘅香港人講， 因為以下建議，可能會係你哋文宣轉風向嘅參考:<br />\n<br />\n首先，除咗要落力爭取西方政商界嘅支持之外， 同時亦都要全面令海外普羅大眾明白，一但香港嘅抗共革命失敗嘅話， 唔單止會令所有喺香港有資產利益嘅人士蒙受損失之外 ，亦都會使各國將會面對中共赤納粹所操控嘅動員勢力，破壞貴國自身社會秩序和威脅文明世界的存亡， 當中包括宣傳戰、人口殖民、代理操控、 經濟戰 、貨幣操控、甚至代理戰爭。 <br />\n呢啲事情嘅發生，都係可能會因為世界各國都對中共嘅侵略性舉動視若無睹或坐以待斃， 而可以借香港鎮壓嘅經驗照板煮碗再嚟多次。<br />\n所以必須要令海外群眾了解到中共赤納粹嘅危險性 ，並提醒香港所發生嘅事情，佢哋嘅地方亦都有可能發生！<br />\n<br />\n此外， 大家都唔好忘記赤納粹亦都開始對西方世界以及社交媒體，進行類似俄羅斯操控西方政治嘅宣傳戰， 當中包括抹黑前線手足、正當化血腥手段，以及轉移視線， 佢哋呢啲內容農場式嘅謊言謬論，都好容易借西方言論自由嘅 漏洞去灌輸佢哋呢種反智嘅假訊息， 從而操控 西方民意打壓抗爭手足。 <br />\n所以喺做文宣爭取海外政商界和民眾支持嘅同時，亦都要旗幟鮮明逐點反駁佢哋嘅荒謬言論， 因為當權者長時間講咁多大話， 會令群眾都相信嗰個大話係真嘅， 簡單啲就係戈培爾效應<br />\n<br />\n另外，我喺呢度要特別同美國人講， 現時港共政府嘅血腥鎮壓已經可以符合到特朗普全面取消中美trade deal嘅理由， 就係佢講句香港嘅抗爭運動走向六四式血腥鎮壓嘅話，就直接停止談判同達成協議。 故此就算大多數政商界，未必會喺輿論上企喺香港抗爭者嗰一面嘅話， 亦都唔好擔心， 因為你哋係有權用佢哋嘅選票同經濟能力去制裁嗰啲違背文明價值觀嘅政商大佬。 <br />\n所以必須要明白解救香港人於水深火熱之中嘅必要性 ， 從而可以令我哋嘅前線手足有一個堅強嘅後盾支持。<br />\n<br />\n最後，我喺呢度同所有有睇呢篇文嘅大家講 ( 包括長時間監察連登著嘅黑警走狗同土共 ) ， 港共同赤納粹嘅所作所為已經好一清二楚， 因為佢哋嘅一舉已經係干犯咗反人類嘅罪行， 為咗自己嘅政治目的以及政治存亡，就不惜以攬炒嘅心態，去犧牲香港平民百姓嘅生命財產安全，以及公然褫奪佢哋嘅基本公民權利， 甚至當然喺大眾眼前 向手無寸鐵嘅平民致命武力， 從而將恐懼植入喺社會當中。<br />\n所以呢個時候仲唔以你所能去反抗嘅話， 喺嗰個政權機器眼中你只不過係一個可以宰殺嘅行屍走肉， 就算你點維護呢個政權，你都要好似性玩具咁樣被用完即棄， 更加唔洗講你以後將會被貼上遺臭萬年嘅罪名。<br />\n<br />\n「光復香港時代革命」並唔係一個恐怖主義式嘅意識形態， 係象徵住一個可以喺屬於自己嘅家園安居樂業、生兒育女、一展所長嘅希望， 時代革命就係代表以社會變革嘅力量去打造光明大路， 從而可以令我哋嘅子女可以係一個冇恐懼壓迫嘅家園一入面成長。<br />\n<br />\n我希望手足們可以喺呢個內戰當中，留住自己唯一嘅生命去奮鬥落去， 直至到我哋呢個家園重獲自由， 或與敵同歸於盡。<br />\n<br />\n我們永不忘記 我們永不原諒<br />\n我們必定反抗 我們必定報仇<br />\n<br />\n光復香港時代革命<br />\n驅逐共黨解放香港<br />\n肅清警隊刻不容緩<br />\n<br />\n皇天"},{"pid":"9d838ff110f258734620fcdc5e49371251221e45","tid":1712477,"uid":251732,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-12T14:29:42.000Z","msg":"pish

these nights, the suppression from the Hong Kong Police shows the beginning of an unfair battle, especially in the battle of the Chinese University of Hong Kong right now. It is obvious that Carrie Lam, the head of Chinazi puppet government, and the supporters behind her, do not perceive Hong Kong teenagers as human. They attempt to eliminate the next generation as much as possible, to extend the Chinazi government.<br />\n<br />\nTherefore, I want to say something to the foreign brothers that are spreading propaganda, and also to the Hongkongers living overseas, because the following suggestions could be important for making of the propagandas:<br />\n<br />\nFirst, besides gaining the support from the political and business leaders, we also need to let all foreigners know, if the anti-Communism revolution fails, not only will all assets owners in Hong Kong suffer losses, but it will also lead to the manipulation of all countries by the Chinazi power, destroying the regulations of countries and threatening the civilized world. This includes the propaganda war, colonization, manipulation, economic war, currency manipulation and even real war. These will happen probably because of the ignorance of the invasive actions from the Chinazi government in all countries, and the government can even reference the suppression of Hong Kong, and do the same for other countries. Therefore, we need to let all foreigners know about the dangers of Chinazi, and remember what happened in Hong Kong, as it might also happen in other places!<br />\n<br />\nBesides, we should not forget that Chinazi is manipulating the West and its social media, just like the propaganda war of the USSR, including the accusation of the protesters, normalizing violent means, and shifting its focus. These lies are similar to content farms, utilizing the freedom of speech in the West to instill these fake messsages in order to control the public opinion to suppress the protesters. Therefore, while spreading propagandas to gain support from the foreign public, we should clearly refute their absurd lies, because when the power holder tells lies for a long time, the public would believe in those lies, just like the Goebbels effect.<br />\n<br />\nMoreoever, I want to tell the US people that the violent suppression by the Hong Kong government matches the reason that Trump would fully cancel the US-China trade deal, as he says that if the Hong Kong social movements becomes the violent suppression in Tiananmen Square, they would halt the talk on trade deals and agreement. So even if many political and business leaders do not stand with Hong Kong protesters, we should not worry, as we have the rights to vote and use the economic powers to sanction leaders that go against the civilized views. Therefore, we need to know the importance of saving Hong Kong people under fire, and let the protesters know that they are strongly supported. <br />\n<br />\nFinally, I want to say to all who see this message (including those police dogs and wumao monitoring the forum) that the actions of the Hong Kong government and Chinazi are very obvious that they violated the rights of human. They just want to fulfill their political goals with whatever it takes by sacrificing the lives of Hong Kong citizens and assets, taking away the civil rights from them, and even using lethal force on unarmed civilians, to implant a fearful atmosphere in the society. So if you do not fight against them with all we have, then you are just a dead man walking that can be slaughtered at any moment. No matter how you protect this regime, you will be quickly abandoned after being used, just like a condom, not to mention the crime labelled on you forever."},{"pid":"15d25ab4a026dc410efe853e15ea5482fa19c93b","tid":1712477,"uid":48433,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2019-11-12T16:17:15.000Z","msg":"&quot;Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times&quot;
