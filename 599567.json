Not Air Until 2019<br />\nSay it ain&rsquo;t so.<br />\n<br />\nBy Mallory Chin/Jan 4, 2018/Entertainment<br />\n<br />\nLooks like diehard Rick and Morty fans will have to wait until 2019 for Season 4 of the hit show to make its return to Adult Swim. During a recent podcast interview, one of the show&rsquo;s writer, Ryan Ridley, said that as far as he was aware no one had even started working on the new season yet. He also pointed out that the script for Rick and Morty&rsquo;s third season was finished in November 2016, about eight months before the show returned to Adult Swim.<br />\n<br />\nRidley also stated that based on previous production schedules it would pretty surprising if the show&rsquo;s fourth season managed to air before 2019, which could mean the wait could be longer than the gap between the second and third season, which was 18 months.<br />\n<br />\nRidley stated:<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;They really take their time. I never understood why everybody &mdash; all parties, Dan, Justin, and Adult Swim &mdash; didn&rsquo;t get their shit together, and make the show fast. I just don&rsquo;t get it. It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me. I&rsquo;m sure they all have their reasons. I know how long this show takes to write, let alone animate. I&rsquo;d be surprised if there was a fourth season on the air anytime sooner than 2019&hellip; late 2019. Get your shit together, you guys. Get it all together, and put it in a backpack.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"50d81018b951a7dfa20a58e60803a4c9365e46cd","tid":599567,"uid":42852,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-03-22T02:11:44.000Z","msg":"有排等<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a4c563d872122a158af6f86544dfc657f375fcd1","tid":599567,"uid":45627,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-03-22T02:35:55.000Z","msg":"等冇所謂呀<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 唔好冇就得"},{"pid":"dd3756357bf74673233823509c551335cb2c25ad","tid":599567,"uid":46140,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-03-22T03:08:23.000Z","msg":"第三季個尾真係差咗"}]}
