A dog barking, an fire engine siren wailing, a child shouting, an airplane roaring overhead and a lightning storm will scare rabbits. Therefore, walking a rabbit on a leash is not recommended. Indoor rabbits have a much longer lifespan than outdoor rabbits, because indoor rabbits are protected from poor weather conditions and enemies. They feel safe, protected, sheltered and monitored and that they are part of the family ! An average lifespan of an indoor house rabbit is 8-14 years. An average lifespan of rabbit kept in an outdoor hutch or cage is 3-6 years. The happiest rabbit expression is called Binky. When a rabbit binkies, it jumps into the air and twists its head and body in the opposite direction before falling back to the ground. Besides binkies, a rabbit even twirls, flops, shakes its head and stretches its legs. All this is telling you that it is happy and overall pleased with you and its life. The video below shows two rabbits binkying, full of happiness.<br />\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/pqOeRBSpaCs\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FpqOeRBSpaCs&d=GMKqUHOqK0NWwf0BctgWdQtTNu1qqkxUxYmVHECffP4%3D&h=639aec23\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/pqOeRBSpaCs</a><br />\n<br />\nMore information on why indoor rabbits live longer: <a href=\"https://rabbit.org/indoor-living-is-best-for-rabbits/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Frabbit.org%2Findoor-living-is-best-for-rabbits%2F&d=GMKqUHOqK0NWwf0BctgWdQtTNu1qqkxUxYmVHECffP4%3D&h=949af164\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://rabbit.org/indoor-living-is-best-for-rabbits/</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://rabbit.org/why-to-keep-your-rabbit-indoors/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Frabbit.org%2Fwhy-to-keep-your-rabbit-indoors%2F&d=GMKqUHOqK0NWwf0BctgWdQtTNu1qqkxUxYmVHECffP4%3D&h=1b30ba6b\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://rabbit.org/why-to-keep-your-rabbit-indoors/</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\">N.B.: </span>Too many people abandon rabbits primarily because they do not understand rabbits and think that rabbits are boring and that they don't bond with humans. Rabbits are highly intelligent, social and affectionate. While they don't like to be picked up from the ground, they much prefer to be cuddled and petted while they are on the ground or in your lap. If you're interested in adopting, you can visit the Hong Kong Rabbit Society and <span style=\"color: green;\"><strong>choose a rabbit for adoption</strong></span>.
