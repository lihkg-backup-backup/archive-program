Examples include the United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Poland, Sweden, Estonia, Romania, Denmark, and Latvia. Greece has agreed to use Ericsson, rather than Huawei, to develop its 5G infrastructure.<br />\n<br />\nSome of the largest telecom companies around the globe are also becoming &ldquo;Clean Telcos.&rdquo; Orange in France, Jio in India, Telstra in Australia, SK and KT in South Korea, NTT in Japan, and O2 in the United Kingdom are rejecting doing business with tools of the Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s surveillance state, like Huawei. The big three telecommunications companies in Canada have decided to partner with Ericsson, Nokia, and Samsung, because public opinion was overwhelmingly against allowing Huawei to build Canada&rsquo;s 5G networks.<br />\n<br />\nTelef&oacute;nica states in its Digital Manifesto that &ldquo;security is paramount,&rdquo; and its CEO and Chairman Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a &Aacute;lvarez-Pallete L&oacute;pez recently declared, &ldquo;Telef&oacute;nica is proud to be a 5G Clean Path company. Telef&oacute;nica Spain and O2 (UK) are fully clean networks, and Telef&oacute;nica Deutschland (Germany) and Vivo (Brazil) will be in the near future without equipment from any untrusted vendors.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nJapan&rsquo;s NTT states, &ldquo;The safety and security of our customers and their personal information is our top priority. In this context, the statement by US government regarding 5G Clean Network is consistent with our position. That is why we are glad to be appreciated as a 5G Clean Telecommunications company and are committed to only using trusted vendors in our 5G networks in Japan and as we expand our business around the world.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/clean_telcos_v5-06242020.jpeg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.state.gov%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F06%2Fclean_telcos_v5-06242020.jpeg&h=8766743c&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"0aa4d41ce367f6bfc567ef361b79d4910683c2fc","tid":2117097,"uid":265839,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-20T14:53:46.000Z","msg":"&quot;Clean&quot; network<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n支那污糟邋遢"},{"pid":"77b4a6d28f77b24eae2b455e74aeafc4d05e3fca","tid":2117097,"uid":36551,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-07-20T15:05:12.000Z","msg":"台灣五個台全部都唔用屎為<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n中華、遠傳 &gt; Ericsson + Nokia<br />\n台灣大哥大、亞太、台星 &gt; Nokia"},{"pid":"f44328ac1f61373d800036eb841a023386ab4179","tid":2117097,"uid":8511,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-07-20T15:07:42.000Z","msg":"orange 係咪以前誠哥既orange?"},{"pid":"e2562fe52943ef9674bdfeb09aba7095a23924bb","tid":2117097,"uid":279835,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-20T15:08:21.000Z","msg":"香港今次成為Dirty Networks 成員了. <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8304da447d579dca5e8c6b74347b509bf945cf34","tid":2117097,"uid":279835,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"f44328ac1f61373d800036eb841a023386ab4179","tid":2117097,"uid":8511,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-07-20T15:07:42.000Z","msg":"orange 係咪以前誠哥既orange?"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-20T15:09:52.000Z","msg":"曾經係. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hk/Orange_\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fzh.wikipedia.org%2Fzh-hk%2FOrange_&d=bKbBxrmwQkzC5eAvTqWhP1HO27hz5fVRhbnvZL2FK%2Bg%3D&h=a2ff3e08\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hk/Orange_</a>(%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8)"},{"pid":"8cddeb2eac1bfa318cfe2160c79af3b7b5fe555f","tid":2117097,"uid":40267,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"77b4a6d28f77b24eae2b455e74aeafc4d05e3fca","tid":2117097,"uid":36551,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-07-20T15:05:12.000Z","msg":"台灣五個台全部都唔用屎為<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n中華、遠傳 &gt; Ericsson + Nokia<br />\n台灣大哥大、亞太、台星 &gt; Nokia"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-20T15:17:32.000Z","msg":"我對台仔有啲保留<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/L69vm14.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FL69vm14.jpg&h=1aad7205&s={SIZE}\" /><img src=\"https://na.cx/i/vteCMtL.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FvteCMtL.jpg&h=7a3cf7a4&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"844aa788e1ede6650d46b16a286cc5bb15949aee","tid":2117097,"uid":310461,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"77b4a6d28f77b24eae2b455e74aeafc4d05e3fca","tid":2117097,"uid":36551,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-07-20T15:05:12.000Z","msg":"台灣五個台全部都唔用屎為<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n中華、遠傳 &gt; Ericsson + Nokia<br />\n台灣大哥大、亞太、台星 &gt; Nokia"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-20T16:21:57.000Z","msg":"i like Ericsson even though they may not have best look on products but very solid on hardware!!"},{"pid":"68c7cc9dde37855a8f413255f58b62bd91ea1a2d","tid":2117097,"uid":286146,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-21T07:09:50.000Z","msg":"個供應鏈都大<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n真係全球反華為"},{"pid":"a749a073be0f61f3e4520fcb945f8cc9f6e98233","tid":2117097,"uid":286146,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"77b4a6d28f77b24eae2b455e74aeafc4d05e3fca","tid":2117097,"uid":36551,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":3,"replyTime":"2020-07-20T15:05:12.000Z","msg":"台灣五個台全部都唔用屎為<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n中華、遠傳 &gt; Ericsson + Nokia<br />\n台灣大哥大、亞太、台星 &gt; Nokia"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-21T07:10:36.000Z","msg":"反觀香港<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n得數記唔係用屎為"}]}
