It was a profile that was already discussed last summer and it still remains in the Rossoneri's thought process. It remains a temptation because Roma are not convinced of the formula of the proposed transfer. The Turkish player is no longer a main part of the squad, but he may get more playing time after Zaniolo's injury. Under is still a big investment for Roma and they won't entertain the thought of selling without the right offer. The thought is still there, but realizing it remains a dream for now.  <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://gianlucadimarzio.com/en/milan-tempted-by-romas-cengiz-under-the-latest\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgianlucadimarzio.com%2Fen%2Fmilan-tempted-by-romas-cengiz-under-the-latest&d=EP%2BJfZZVzGvO4DQPpGaiyACffgmrlYx1zcVg66SIO7I%3D&h=595b4bc2\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://gianlucadimarzio.com/en/milan-tempted-by-romas-cengiz-under-the-latest</a>"},{"pid":"5985857c51b8bcd0863f70dc87610d49e5a14680","tid":1822998,"uid":16659,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-15T06:15:45.000Z","msg":"Milan, PSV set on Ricardo Rodriguez: price set<br />\n<br />\nThe negotiations between Milan and PSV for Ricardo Rodriguez will come down to how much financial muscle the Dutch club wants to flex.
