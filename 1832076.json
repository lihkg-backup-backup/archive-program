In the front garden he planted a litchi tree, a mango tree, a chestnut oak, two black maples, three red maples and bushes in the lawn. Some of the bushes produce bassoon-shaped flowers. He also grew flowers such as pink roses, red roses, orchids, violets, sunflowers, lavender and hydrangeas, most of which are in bloom. There're some exquisite flowerpots placed near the lawn as decoration. He mows the grass every now and then. He hires a gardener to manicure his garden from time to time. His back garden is enormous which is two thousand five hundred square foot in size. It used to be a lawn but he turned it into a meadow blanketed in wild flowers and exotic flowers. Some of the flower buds haven't opened yet but as the weather gets warmer thr flowers open. Even inside his house he has a vase of hydrangeas and a few plotted plants, some of which are just coming into bloom. Orchids can be cultivated in vases or flower pots. In summer beautiful summer flowers bloom in the meadow. In spring the meadow is covered in pretty spring flowers. In the fall the meadow is a mass of lovely fall flowers. In the winter it's blanketed with beautiful winter flowers. It's an extraordinary garden. Every valentine's day he buys her a bouquet of red roses and hydrangea. They're lovely cut flowers. His new chairs are covered by plastic sheeting. His new television is covered by protective plastic wrappings. About seventy one percent of the earth's surface is covered with water..On mars two percent of its atmosphere is covered by carbon monoxide whereas twenty percent is covered with carbon dioxide."},{"pid":"f50a109ed1b10be5b6d0cfa51350490e22bd9c48","tid":1832076,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-25T05:28:22.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/LAr6oAKieHk\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FLAr6oAKieHk&d=DnofPF37Lcb9g14kkk4r6ife5Xzx4ME6JwL9AZsFK0I%3D&h=6285f3fb\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/LAr6oAKieHk</a>"},{"pid":"55648be7dbdbd181622e866aa412afc9a84278b8","tid":1832076,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-26T05:41:51.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZFQPupSEnk\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCZFQPupSEnk&d=DnofPF37Lcb9g14kkk4r6ife5Xzx4ME6JwL9AZsFK0I%3D&h=6f925469\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZFQPupSEnk</a>"},{"pid":"1807a3608f0dec570147fd7c096e05245ce37a98","tid":1832076,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-27T12:38:08.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/lJZJb0QWRrU\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FlJZJb0QWRrU&d=DnofPF37Lcb9g14kkk4r6ife5Xzx4ME6JwL9AZsFK0I%3D&h=3bad4582\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/lJZJb0QWRrU</a>"},{"pid":"5ea80e332ebdb040af10c5a50e3ea15b8f9faabf","tid":1832076,"uid":173179,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-27T17:32:23.000Z","msg":"今次真係唔知可以點開"},{"pid":"893063e04b73cc311a14b0b66e3d72f180f60309","tid":1832076,"uid":2040,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-27T17:58:10.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d6cbb11ac636be0e29cdd8274c3bb38fb3ea00af","tid":1832076,"uid":154406,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-28T05:16:51.000Z","msg":"我唔會開"},{"pid":"ae56cf203c5302ef61132e06d2fa467a8495c894","tid":1832076,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-30T13:17:31.000Z","msg":"Happy new year, I hope all your endeavours in 2020 are successful."},{"pid":"05d70f1662e7ee642fb8bbf2f2d01b576524b603","tid":1832076,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-31T04:08:39.000Z","msg":"LeBron James' cousin and I have been wanting to go on a cruise around the atlantic ocean exploring new islands 🏝for a long time but the cruise ships which we've looked at are all out of commission. Dream cruise is out of conkiddikn by broken components and power failures and won't be in commission until June. Costa cruise which is also out of commission for repairs is expected to be back in commission in November. Oh well. His cousin has broken up with his girlfriend lately so he's a bit down. To those of you who's broken up and haven't yet found new love: Keep your chin up. You might find it worth your while to read &quot;men are from Mars women venus&quot; written by John gray. He's a relationship expert whose work elaborates the keys to a successful long term relationship. I was reluctant to read it at first but it turned out to be worth my while as I've learnt loads about how men and women think differently. Mant successful couples say that this international bestseller is worth its weight in gold. For what it's worth, you can also consult a social worker. take heart ! LeBron James' cousin wants to march his pink shirt to a pair of chinos. Pink matches beige and khaki. Punk matches up with black and white too. It goes with navy blue and sky blue as well. Unfortunately Zara ifc is closed for refurbishment. It's being retrofitted with new clothes racks, shelves and updated door jambs. Oh well I suppose we can go to another branch."},{"pid":"7db1335d40a792dc6a0e1389ff2faa3e1141a71b","tid":1832076,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T12:36:45.000Z","msg":"james harden gogogo"},{"pid":"4653da5335bdc263a01e0a93e558d0d2b2c991a3","tid":1832076,"uid":224375,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-04T13:31:42.000Z","msg":"有冇喺香港買到湖人60周年紀念特刊？<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/kA9y00a.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FkA9y00a.jpg&h=a02cca1e&s={SIZE}\" />"}]}
