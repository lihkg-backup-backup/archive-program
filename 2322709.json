Texas has not demonstrated a judicially   cognizable interest in the manner in which another State   conducts its elections.  All other pending motions are dismissed   as moot.                    <br />\n<br />\n<strong><span class=\"x-large\"><span class=\"purple\">Statement of Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins</span></span></strong>:  In my view, we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a  bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original  jurisdiction.  See Arizona v. California, 589 U. S. ___   (Feb. 24, 2020) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  I would therefore  grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not  grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121120zr_p860.pdf\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.supremecourt.gov%2Forders%2Fcourtorders%2F121120zr_p860.pdf&d=Lu%2FYWbP3Pl%2BxzjQ0by0jcq%2FFu68%2BWP7gD6%2BC1gzqbK8%3D&h=ef7a939c\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121120zr_p860.pdf</a>"}]}
