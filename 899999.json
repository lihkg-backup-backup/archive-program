Kyrsten Sinema is the apparent winner in the Arizona Senate race, narrowly defeating Republican Rep. Martha McSally, according to NBC News.<br />\n<br />\nSinema is the first Democratic senator elected in Arizona in 30 years.<br />\n<br />\nMcSally conceded the race in a video statement on her Twitter account Monday evening.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I just called Kyrsten Sinema and congratulated her on being Arizona's first female senator after a hard fight battle,&quot; McSally said. &quot;I wish her all success as she represents Arizona in the senate.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe race had been too close to call on election night and since then has been mired in a nail-biting process of counting outstanding mail-in ballots. A large portion of the voting population in Arizona votes by mail, and each of those ballots had to go through a signature verification process, which typically lasts several days after Election Day.<br />\n<br />\nThis process, however, came under intense scrutiny in recent days after President Donald Trump and other Republicans stoked unfounded claims that Sinema's growing lead was because of voter fraud.<br />\n<br />\nOver the weekend, Sinema's lead expanded by more than 32,000 votes as mail-in ballots were counted, driving her campaign to declare that her advantage was &quot;insurmountable.&quot; It also came after Arizona Republicans won a lawsuit to force equity in how mail-in ballot signatures were being verified in each county.<br />\n<br />\nSinema will replace GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, who did not seek a second term.<br />\n<br />\nAs a congresswoman, Sinema represented a district based in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. She is a former Green Party activist who transformed herself into a centrist Democrat with one of the most conservative voting records among Democrats in Congress.<br />\n<br />\nMcSally, a former combat fighter pilot who was a Trump critic in 2016, represented a Tucson district that voted for Hillary Clinton.<br />\n<br />\nTrump won Arizona in the 2016 presidential election by 3 percentage points, which fueled Democrats' hope that Sinema could turn the red-leaning state blue by appealing to a sufficient number of alienated Republicans voters.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the campaign, the two candidates hammered each other over their voting records in Congress and on hot-button issues such as immigration and health care.<br />\n<br />\nSinema painted McSally as a partisan who would blindly go along with Trump's agenda while presenting herself to voters as a problem-solver who could work with the president on different policy matters but still hold his administration accountable.<br />\n<br />\nSinema had said that if she was elected she would not be an &quot;apologist&quot; for either the Democratic Party or Trump."},{"pid":"b936a77bbd8c2ea40f652376e45e6bf2a1242f0f","tid":899999,"uid":134071,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-13T01:41:38.000Z","msg":"有關 Kyrsten Sinema
