The movie is already Warner Bros.' highest grossing movie ever in China. The domestic numbers certainly aren't hurting Aquaman, though. On Christmas Day alone, Aquaman earned about $22 million at the North American box office. This is a figure that few movies have achieved. With this Christmas day total, Aquaman joins company with several Star Wars sequels, Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes and James Cameron's Avatar. This trend is also very good news for Aquaman and the DC Extended Universe as a whole.<br />\n<br />\n希望dc之後keep住個勢做返好d, 有得同marvel打吓<br />\n兩間有競爭先有進步<img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/tongue.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
