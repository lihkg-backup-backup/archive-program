It is quite simply wrong for Beijing&rsquo;s Communist foreign ministry to get involved with an issue which should be determined within Hong Kong.&rdquo;<br />\n<img

/>\nChina&rsquo;s foreign ministry recently requested a meeting with the FCC and asked for the event to be cancelled, a source told AFP.<br />\n<br />\nIn a statement issued Friday, the ministry said: &ldquo;We resolutely oppose any external forces providing a platform for &lsquo;Hong Kong independence&rsquo; elements to spread fallacies.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nCity leader Carrie Lam, appointed by a pro-Beijing committee, also weighed in Sunday, expressing &ldquo;regret&rdquo; at the planned event and noting that the historic club building is government-owned.<br />\n<br />\nThe club has said Chan&rsquo;s talk on August 14 will still go ahead.<br />\n<br />\nIt is part of a &ldquo;club lunch&rdquo; tradition which has seen an array of speakers, including Chinese officials, address members and the media.<br />\n<br />\nActivists calling for independence from Hong Kong emerged from the failure of the mass pro-democracy Umbrella Movement rallies of 2014 to win political reform.<br />\n<br />\nAny talk of a split has become a red flag for Beijing, which has ramped up rhetoric against threats to its territorial integrity under President Xi Jinping.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong police last month sought to ban Chan&rsquo;s party &mdash; which promotes the city&rsquo;s independence from China but only has a core membership of around a dozen people &mdash; citing it as a national security threat.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong&rsquo;s security chief had said he was considering the police request while the party was given a few weeks to make representations.<br />\n<br />\nPro-independence campaigners and politicians calling for self-determination for Hong Kong have been banned from standing for office and disqualified from the legislature.<br />\n<br />\nThe city&rsquo;s best-known independence advocate Edward Leung was jailed for six years in June on rioting charges after clashes with police in 2016.<br />\n<br />\n<a
