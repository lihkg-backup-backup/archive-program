This bill, if passed, will pose an imminent threat to civil rights in the former British territory and have serious effects on British interests there, because of its erasure of the judicial boundary between Hong Kong and Mainland China. The European Union has lodged a formal diplomatic summon with the Hong Kong government over this matter [1], and the United Kingdom and Canada have also issued a statement [2]. However, I am afraid that these statements were mere lip service, and stronger action from Parliament will be necessary.<br />\n<br />\n[1] <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-extradition-eu/eu-lodges-formal-diplomatic-note-against-contentious-hong-kong-extradition-bill-idUSKCN1SU0OS\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-hongkong-extradition-eu%2Feu-lodges-formal-diplomatic-note-against-contentious-hong-kong-extradition-bill-idUSKCN1SU0OS&d=AePTNAtL1N4PdcNq2S6jCI2ydpG6lAcy7lEd76f4zig%3D&h=7333e68c\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-hongkong-extradition-eu%2Feu-lodges-formal-diplomatic-note-against-contentious-hong-kong-extradition-bill-idUSKCN1SU0OS&h=8a6ea583\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-extradition-eu/eu-lodges-formal-diplomatic-note-against-contentious-hong-kong-extradition-bill-idUSKCN1SU0OS</a><br />\n[2] <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-canada-joint-statement-on-hong-kong\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fnews%2Fuk-and-canada-joint-statement-on-hong-kong&d=AePTNAtL1N4PdcNq2S6jCI2ydpG6lAcy7lEd76f4zig%3D&h=d1f94879\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-canada-joint-statement-on-hong-kong</a><br />\n<br />\nThe Hong Kong government currently has extradition agreements with 18 countries, including the UK. The proposed amendment will extend extradition coverage to laws of Mainland China which has a track record of arbitrary enforcement and interpretation of the law. Once enacted, the ordinance threatens all people regardless of their nationality. For example, activists, political dissidents and even foreign tourists or travellers could be subject to arrest and be detained while they are in transit, travelling, working and living in Hong Kong. This will pose a serious threat to British interests in Hong Kong, especially to international corporations and NGOs that have conducted sensitive work that may be subject to arbitrary interpretation of laws in China.<br />\n<br />\nUntil now, the judicial separation between Hong Kong and Mainland China, and the strong track record of free speech and the rule of law, has allowed international organisations and British businesses to thrive in Hong Kong and use the city as a base camp for their East Asian operations. Although the Hong Kong government has claimed that &lsquo;political criminals&rsquo; will not be extradited, in the case of the imprisonment and prosecution of the Causeway Bay booksellers in Mainland China, the booksellers have been charged by the Mainland Chinese government with criminal offences like traffic offences, illegal business operations, libel, fraud or extortion. These amendments would advance the Mainland Chinese government&rsquo;s suppression of dissent as well as deprive the legal protection of Hong Kong citizens and foreign nationals in Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nThere are an estimated 200,000 British citizens in Hong Kong, and a further 3 million there who hold British National (Overseas) status; and there are also an estimated 100,000 Hongkongers in the UK. This law may seem to be a local law in Hong Kong, but would in effect threaten the very existence of British business and cultural connections to East Asia.<br />\n<br />\nI urge you, as my Member of Parliament, to request our Parliament and Government to take further action to oppose the introduction of this proposed extradition law in Hong Kong, in order to secure British interests and fulfil the UK's duty to &quot;high degree of autonomy&quot; and the rights and freedoms in Hong Kong set down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.<br />\n<br />\nYours sincerely,<br />\n[Name]<br />\n[Address in constituency]"},{"pid":"b98a5e3824b9e0fc692a46052677c78aba03e4de","tid":1198855,"uid":228995,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-10T12:14:42.000Z","msg":"好似得fax number ..."},{"pid":"bf902147893e31f944807951e7f069014356ac8a","tid":1198855,"uid":65889,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-13T03:54:33.000Z","msg":"British National (Overseas) Citizens should be given full British Citizenship.<br />\n<a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/244402/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpetition.parliament.uk%2Fpetitions%2F244402%2F&d=AePTNAtL1N4PdcNq2S6jCI2ydpG6lAcy7lEd76f4zig%3D&h=a41ae37e\" target=\"_blank\">https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/244402/</a>"},{"pid":"c07dc53a7553b7d34335861c4f25d25c162937bd","tid":1198855,"uid":3068,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"bf902147893e31f944807951e7f069014356ac8a","tid":1198855,"uid":65889,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-13T03:54:33.000Z","msg":"British National (Overseas) Citizens should be given full British Citizenship.<br />\n<a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/244402/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpetition.parliament.uk%2Fpetitions%2F244402%2F&d=AePTNAtL1N4PdcNq2S6jCI2ydpG6lAcy7lEd76f4zig%3D&h=a41ae37e\" target=\"_blank\">https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/244402/</a>"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-13T05:07:35.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
