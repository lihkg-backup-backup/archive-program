The pitch &mdash; Washington and the Pentagon needed to sell fighter jets to Taiwan &hellip; or else.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;China has been aggressively modernizing their forces,&rdquo; Lockheed warned in a briefing to the U.S. Air Force&rsquo;s headquarters for the Pacific region. &ldquo;By 2015, they will outnumber Taiwan by &hellip; an almost four-to-one majority.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Immediate action required to modernize Taiwan air force or trends may be irreversible,&rdquo; one bullet point declared. &ldquo;Window for decision closing,&rdquo; another ominously noted.<br />\n...<br />\nThe presentation is a revealing look at how Lockheed lobbies senior U.S. military officials. The company also picked a great time to make the pitch. Two months before the meeting, the Defense Intelligence Agency had released a scathing summary of Taipei&rsquo;s air defenses.<br />\n...<br />\nLockheed also derided the Ching-kuos&mdash;named after former Taiwanese president Chiang Ching Kuo &mdash; as a poor F-16 knockoff.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1984, Taiwan&rsquo;s Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation started developing the Ching-kuos after Washington refused to sell the more powerful American fighters. As a small consolation, American defense contractors helped design the aircraft, also known as the Indigenous Defense Fighter or IDF.<br />\n<br />\nThe resulting F-CK-1s don&rsquo;t have the F-16&rsquo;s range and can&rsquo;t carry as much weaponry. The Ching-Kuos have two engines &mdash; modified civilian designs &mdash; that don&rsquo;t produce as much thrust as the Falcon&rsquo;s single jet motor.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Its name says it all,&rdquo; Lockheed chided, referring to the the F-CK. &ldquo;This could best be described as the best aircraft the U.S. State Department ever designed.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nLockheed even added a veiled threat &mdash; it argued the company&rsquo;s entire F-16 production line might grind to a halt without a new sale to Taipei.<br />\n<br />\nThe company also dismissed its competitors&rsquo; fighters. Lockheed told the Air Force that the Boeing-made F-15 and F-18, the French Rafale, Swedish Gripen and the Eurofighter were not viable options.<br />\n<br />\nNone of the manufacturers would risk selling weapons to Taiwan, because they feared China &hellip; according to Lockheed.<br />\n<br />\nThen, Lockheed&rsquo;s briefing implied that without Falcons to offer in the future&mdash;since the company would stop making them&mdash;the Pentagon would have little choice but to sell Taiwan &hellip; F-35s.<br />\n<br />\nA new F-16 package &ldquo;keeps Taiwan in the fourth-generation fighter family&rdquo; and &ldquo;forgoes possible escalation to fifth generation fighter,&rdquo; the briefing stated.<br />\n<br />\nIn other words &mdash; if the U.S. decided not to escalate tensions with China now, it would have to dramatically do it tomorrow. Of course, the U.S. doesn&rsquo;t have to sell F-35s to anyone, let alone Taiwan.<br />\n<br />\nWashington and the Pentagon didn&rsquo;t buy into Lockheed&rsquo;s pitch. The contractor and its political supporters didn&rsquo;t take it well.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;It remains to be seen whether this administration is going to kowtow to the Chinese or if it&rsquo;s going to support the Taiwan military as previous administrations have in the past,&rdquo; an aide to Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in July 2011.<br />\n<br />\nIn the end, Washington allowed the company&rsquo;s aviation division to upgrade Taiwan&rsquo;s existing Falcons. Lockheed expects to install new radars, electronic countermeasures and other systems on the planes&mdash;renamed F-16Vs &mdash; soon. And despite what company reps told the Air Force, Lockheed&rsquo;s Falcon production line is still up and running.<br />\n...<br />\n###"},{"pid":"bc19932b1f2fe4898e34a3818398ba01f363a39e","tid":304018,"uid":71725,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-30T15:01:07.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"b7e51e6379ead6fa2e700b18158d8e62469ca32c","tid":304018,"uid":29804,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-30T15:03:20.000Z","msg":"臺空軍主力<br />\n<br />\nF16 AB, 逐步升級成F16V<br />\n幻影2000<br />\nCK-1 經國號<br />\n<br />\n質素夠，數量唔夠"},{"pid":"395137c0ffbc10f0c0fe19e1556e7c228ae6b8e1","tid":304018,"uid":51720,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-06-30T15:10:55.000Z","msg":"<blockquote>臺空軍主力<br />\n<br />\nF16 AB, 逐步升級成F16V<br />\n幻影2000<br />\nCK-1 經國號<br />\n<br />\n質素夠，數量唔夠</blockquote><br />\n1980年代，台灣仲希望有 F-20（即舊稱 F-5G），只係當時列根政府，拒絕批准軍售而落空。"}]}
