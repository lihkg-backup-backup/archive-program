It imprisons people for longer periods of time, more mercilessly, and for more trivial transgressions than any nation in the west. This sprawling penal state has been constructed over decades, by both political parties, and it punishes the poor and racial minorities at overwhelmingly disproportionate rates.<br />\n<br />\n為甚麼有全球最大監獄人口，而且針對少數族裔和弱勢階層？<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\nA new episode unveiled on Tuesday is one of the most vivid examples yet of this mentality. Over the last year, federal investigators found that one of the world's largest banks, HSBC, spent years committing serious crimes, involving money laundering for terrorists;<ins> &quot;facilitat[ing] money laundering by Mexican drug cartels&quot;</ins>; and <ins>&quot;mov[ing] tainted money for Saudi banks tied to terrorist groups&quot;</ins>. Those investigations uncovered substantial evidence &quot;that senior bank officials were complicit in the illegal activity.&quot; As but one example, <ins>&quot;an HSBC executive at one point argued that the bank should continue working with the Saudi Al Rajhi bank, which has supported Al Qaeda.&quot;</ins><br />\n...................<br />\nBut not HSBC. On Tuesday, not only did the US Justice Department announce that HSBC would not be criminally prosecuted, but outright claimed that the reason is that they are too important, too instrumental to subject them to such disruptions. In other words, shielding them from the system of criminal sanction to which the rest of us are subject is not for their good, but for our common good. <br />\n....................<br />\nThat's not merely a dark day for the rule of law. It's a wholesale repudiation of it. <ins>The US government is expressly saying that banking giants reside outside of - above - the rule of law</ins>, that they will not be punished when they get caught red-handed committing criminal offenses for which ordinary people are imprisoned for decades. Aside from the grotesque injustice, the signal it sends is as clear as it is destructive: you are free to commit whatever crimes you want without fear of prosecution. And obviously, if the US government would not prosecute these banks on the ground that they're too big and important, it would - yet again, or rather still - never let them fail.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n為甚麼大財團為毒販洗黑錢，支持恐怖分子活動，就不會犯法？<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/bang.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n為甚麼民主法治國家有三權分立，也是「大案看政治，中案看影響，小案看關係」呢？試舉例說明<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yeah.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5cf26d3ffb91b5e2697dc266f670a8c6aac7d9eb","tid":1176447,"uid":40470,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-05-29T08:44:43.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n咁有乜案看法律？<br />\n<br />\n法律同毒撚條J有乜分別？"},{"pid":"150995ca809c38b66fd670ebff542f78ef299b9d","tid":1176447,"uid":112482,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-05-29T13:16:47.000Z","msg":"Tue, true, and true"},{"pid":"0c66e08ede9731a2410ec426427637cd56b9df1a","tid":1176447,"uid":65686,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-05-29T13:22:20.000Z","msg":"中共：法律？我就係法律。"}]}
