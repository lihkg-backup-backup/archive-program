The loophole/deficiency myth &ndash; Back in the 80s and 90s, the exclusion of mainland China from Hong Kong&rsquo;s extradition law was seen as both deliberate and necessary. The reason being a distrust among the people towards China&rsquo;s peculiar, if not straight-up defunct judiciary system. This is not simply a &lsquo;deficiency&rsquo; in Hong Kong&rsquo;s extradition law as Carrie Lam has termed it in her speech. <br />\n2. The &lsquo;no workable arrangement&rsquo; myth &ndash; Except there is a way for the 170 jurisdictions to issue direct extradition orders to Hong Kong, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Under the current system, if an order is approved by both the court and the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, then the Chief Executive (CE) may authorize to extradite said criminal back to the designated country. The Legislative Council, however, would be bypassed if the current amendment bill is approved, and the CE may authorize orders without a discussion in the Council. The will of the people will be utterly trampled. That-being-said, the mainland problem does remain, as it (alongside governments of the RoC and Macau SAR) cannot issue extradition orders under the pre-amendment law. Whether the people of Hong Kong want this problem to remain, however, is a completely different story.<br />\n3. The murder case political wrangling &ndash; Up to this very moment, the murder case has been preached by the HK government as the justification of the amendment bill. However, this heart-wrenching story also leads to basically a political labyrinth. Namely, Lam has refused to answer which government, Taiwan or Central Government of China would handle the convict once the bill has been passed. It is also quite a well-known fact that Taiwan does not want the murderer back through extradition, since it would pave way for further escalations in Chinese-Taiwan relations.<br />\n4. The general unwillingness to acknowledge pro-democratic elements in Hong Kong society&ndash; In her speech, Lam has referred several times to &lsquo;sectors of our community&rsquo;. However, she had refused a conclave with pro-democratic members of the Legco back when the bill was first proposed in April. Moreover, near the end of speech, she explicitly thanked the pro-establishment legislators and did not mention the pro-democratic camp, instead she thanked &lsquo;people and organizations who have expressed their views in a peaceful and rational manner.&rsquo; This, together with Ambassador Liu Xiaoming&rsquo;s &lsquo;One Country&rsquo; system, should be seen as infringements upon the values of Hong Kong and the &lsquo;One country two systems&rsquo; doctrine. <br />\n5. The &lsquo;9 categories of crime&rsquo; LIE &ndash; 9 categories of offences have been taken off a list of 46 offences subject to surrender. While this pathetic move was hailed by the government as an act of kindness and concession towards social pressure, the crimes removed were mostly corporate crimes, including taxes, pollution and intellectual property. The government has done very little in actually addressing the concerns of the general public, that this law &ndash; with its inclusion of 35 crimes and the conspiracy/ aiding of said crimes &ndash; would not be used by the central government as political leverage or a &lsquo;dissent mower&rsquo;.<br />\n6. The &lsquo;human rights safeguard&rsquo; &ndash; Due to the &lsquo;flexibility&rsquo; of this bill, Lam refused to write any of the so-called human-rights/ fair-trial guarantees into this bill, and we all know how well verbal, bureaucratic promises go &ndash; horribly wrong. Besides, even if we had written them in, what would have happened if China decides to violate it anyways and pull a &lsquo;screw you&rsquo; to our faces? Exactly. Nothing."},{"pid":"c83bbe369a8a5d82195b013b11a665794e22d3de","tid":1238325,"uid":236917,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-06-17T18:45:57.000Z","msg":"7.
