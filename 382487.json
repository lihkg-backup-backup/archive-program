It brings lots of advantages to many industries and so to the country. Hence, I am opposed to less benefit contribute by the tourism.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the main reason is the increase of employment rate, which can affect both directly and indirectly from by tourism. For instance, tourist must need to eat and travel between tourist spots, then waiters and drivers are needed directly, thus the supporting industry such as food supplier could potentially enjoy from more tourist as well. As result, more peoples are able to earn wage and improve their living quality.<br />\n<br />\nThe second reason i believe is, the more number of tourist means the more spending of money, including spending on luxury goods, entertainments, services, beverages and so on. All of the mentioned criteria could draw huge amount of income from tourist, thus creating more business opportunities and help boosting the local economy at the same time, as they benefit each other to establish a cycle-loop by attracting more tourist come and visit.<br />\n<br />\nThe last reason is culture sharing and diversification, it encourages by meeting new friends from different countries, its usually a reaction to share culture in ways of story, mindset and history, especially when you meet a new buddy from another side of the world, curious forces you to know each other. An in-depth understanding or learning from another culture may improve one culture and better civilization development.<br />\n<br />\nIn conclusion, the contribution from tourism industry is far more than nothing or even negative. A country could definitely benefit in different industry of employment, follows by growing economy and more diverse of culture. Hence, i am strongly agree to expand and support the tourism industry.<br />\n<br />\n打完覺得個sentence complexity 好似唔多夠?! 唔該哂大大們!!"},{"pid":"4f0f34d686e773ea8567b2405978684cae3c8a53","tid":382487,"uid":137768,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-08-31T17:30:23.000Z","msg":"[quote]小弟好幾年冇用英文作文(Grammer 可能錯Q哂),,跪求好心大大幫手比分(約有咩Band score?)<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/02.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\nTopic:<br />\n<br />\nThe tourism industry <ins>has grown</ins> enormously over the last fifty years, and there are few places which <ins>are unaffected</ins> by it.
