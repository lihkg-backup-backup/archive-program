It's freezing outside. Bundle up! I'm sat bundled up in a Uniqlo Heattech crew neck t-shirt, a tturtleneck long-sleeved t-shirt, a down coat amd a scarf. My cousin's husband is bundled up in a Uniqlo Heattech V-neck t-shirt, a pink shirt, a leather jacket amd a pair of gloves. I've even bundled up my bunnies amd dogs. Put on some more clothes in case the temperature drops still further. The temperature has gone down significantly over the past five weeks. Wear lots of layers and be sure to have more rest. Keep warm! Yesterday I was in the mood for shopping. I asked my cousin &quot;We could go shopping if you're in the mood.&quot; He said &quot;I'm not really in the mood to go shopping&quot; So at the end I went shopping myself. Jason is in a mood. He's in a bad mood. His friends said &quot;Ignore him - he's in one of his moods.&quot; They're staying out of his way. I had better keep out of his way too."}]}
