Anthony Fauci, Deborah Birx and Robert Redfield &mdash; which Gupta told me was the product of 20 hours of interviews.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe most noteworthy revelation from those interviews, I thought, was former CDC Director Robert Redfield&rsquo;s opinion that Covid-19 originated not from a wet market, but accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan. Redfield stressed that this was his opinion (but an informed one, given his expertise as a virologist). It nonetheless sparked controversy. China has vehemently denied that the virus could have leaked from a lab, and some in U.S. media have reflexively labeled the theory a conspiracy."},{"pid":"b3a7da31024c3c816800da45e87d7a6ba0aff1c3","tid":2487956,"uid":394702,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2021-04-14T02:22:12.000Z","msg":"<span class=\"gold\">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an experienced virologist.
