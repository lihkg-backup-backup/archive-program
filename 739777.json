Animals have two kinds of DNA.<br />\n<br />\nThe one we are most familiar with, nuclear DNA, is passed down in most animals by male and female parents and contains the genetic blueprint for each individual.<br />\n<br />\nThe genome&mdash;made up of DNA&mdash;is constructed with four types of molecules arranged in pairs. In humans, there are three billion of these pairs, grouped into about 20,000 genes.<br />\n<br />\nBut all animals also have DNA in their mitochondria, which are the tiny structures inside each cell that convert energy from food into a form that cells can use.<br />\n<br />\nMitochondria contain 37 genes, and one of them, known as COI, is used to do DNA barcoding.<br />\n<br />\nUnlike the genes in nuclear DNA, which can differ greatly from species to species, all animals have the same set of mitochondrial DNA, providing a common basis for comparison.<br />\n<br />\nMitochondrial DNA is also a lot simpler, and cheaper, to isolate.<br />\n<br />\nAround 2002, Canadian molecular biologist Paul Hebert&mdash;who coined the term &quot;DNA barcode&quot;&mdash;figured out a way to identify species by analysing the COI gene.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The mitochondrial sequence has proved perfect for this all-animal approach because it has just the right balance of two conflicting properties,&quot; said Thaler."},{"pid":"fb45b4c64127263ca1b9d8025113fb72a42628f1","tid":739777,"uid":50856,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T10:57:50.000Z","msg":"'Neutral' mutations<br />\n<br />\nOn the one hand, the COI gene sequence is similar across all animals, making it easy to pick out and compare.<br />\n<br />\nOn the other hand, these mitochondrial snippets are different enough to be able to distinguish between each species.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It coincides almost perfectly with species designations made by specialist experts in each animal domain,&quot; Thaler said.<br />\n<br />\nIn analysing the barcodes across 100,000 species, the researchers found a telltale sign showing that almost all the animals emerged about the same time as humans.<br />\n<br />\nWhat they saw was a lack of variation in so-called &quot;neutral&quot; mutations, which are the slight changes in DNA across generations that neither help nor hurt an individual's chances of survival.<br />\n<br />\nIn other words, they were irrelevant in terms of the natural and sexual drivers of evolution.<br />\n<br />\nHow similar or not these &quot;neutral&quot; mutations are to each other is like tree rings&mdash;they reveal the approximate age of a species.<br />\n<br />\nWhich brings us back to our question: why did the overwhelming majority of species in existence today emerge at about the same time?<br />\n<br />\nDarwin perplexed<br />\n<br />\nEnvironmental trauma is one possibility, explained Jesse Ausubel, director of the Program for the Human Environment at The Rockefeller University.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Viruses, ice ages, successful new competitors, loss of prey&mdash;all these may cause periods when the population of an animal drops sharply,&quot; he told AFP, commenting on the study.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;In these periods, it is easier for a genetic innovation to sweep the population and contribute to the emergence of a new species.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nBut the last true mass extinction event was 65.5 million years ago when a likely asteroid strike wiped out land-bound dinosaurs and half of all species on Earth. This means a population &quot;bottleneck&quot; is only a partial explanation at best.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The simplest interpretation is that life is always evolving,&quot; said Stoeckle.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It is more likely that&mdash;at all times in evolution&mdash;the animals alive at that point arose relatively recently.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nIn this view, a species only lasts a certain amount of time before it either evolves into something new or goes extinct.<br />\n<br />\nAnd yet&mdash;another unexpected finding from the study&mdash;species have very clear genetic boundaries, and there's nothing much in between.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;If individuals are stars, then species are galaxies,&quot; said Thaler. &quot;They are compact clusters in the vastness of empty sequence space.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe absence of &quot;in-between&quot; species is something that also perplexed Darwin, he said."},{"pid":"f9dd210751af58d308a25cf3f48fea1c528f881f","tid":739777,"uid":161649,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-07-12T10:58:50.000Z","msg":"Too long didn&rsquo;t
