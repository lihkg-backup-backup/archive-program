A crisis is usually an unforseen event wreaking havoc though the flu season is predictable as birth and death.

The HA has cooperated with ST Teresa&rsquo;s Hospital to take over patients from Queen&rsquo;s Elizabeth Hospital after treatment and provide rehabilitants with handful of hospital beds in accordance with the blueprint signed early before. As a result, with a view to expedite the transferring in next time, the HA has to initiate meeting and come up with relative agreement,especially regarding the provision of hospital beds and theatre session, with different private healthcare sectors to confront the peak season of flu.<br />\nBesides, the HA has to increase the vacancy of generally outpatient clinical services and strengthen our primary care services. Day-Out and Night-Out clinical services can serve as a direct platform for providing healthcare services and professional counselling. It can also alleviate the burden of emergency room services and heavy medical expenses. In addition, the government has to step up efforts on primary care services ranging from health promotion, community services to specialist clinical services. Primary care services play a prime role in preventing communicable and infectious diseases from disseminating among the community. The government should increase the community healthcare services such as launching vaccination scheme, strengthening the health promotion among the society as well as subsidizing the clinical services operated by family physicians to handle the non-emergency health-related problem. To handle the profound and enduring tide of aging-population, the official has to provide assistance for different elderly health centre and residential care sectors to reinforce the elderly services such as regular health evaluation, body check and consultation about mental health.
