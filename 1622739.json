That speech was ultimately rescheduled for after Tong's scheduled retirement later that month meaning he eventually had the opportunity to speak about Hong Kong but as a former official.<br />\nThe Financial Times first reported some details of the President's commitment.<br />\nAt the time, reporters asked State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus if Tong was barred from making a tough speech after Trump and Xi's trade truce during the G20 summit.<br />\n&quot;I believe that that was based off of anonymous reports, and that's not something that we ever validate here at the State Department. I don't see much truth to that,&quot; she responded.<br />\nTrump has deferred to China on the situation in Hong Kong when asked about it publicly in recent months.<br />\n&quot;Well, something is probably happening with Hong Kong because when you look at, you know, what's going on, they've had riots for a long period of time. And I don't know what China's attitude is,&quot; Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on August 1.<br />\n&quot;Somebody said that at some point they're going to want to stop that. But that's between Hong Kong and that's between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China. They'll have to deal with that themselves. They don't need advice,&quot; he added.<br />\nHe echoed that sentiment in a tweet on August 14.<br />\n&quot;I know President Xi of China very well. He is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people. He is also a good man in a 'tough business.' I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it.
