Arriving back in the UK I can't say I could be more at odds with the liberal globalist cult of British politics.  We don't have to do any more than turn on the TV or look online to see examples of what happens when borders are not respected, when we undergo top down social experiments of mass immigration against the will of the populace.  We don't need to look further than Hong Kong to see the dangers of authoritarian governments.  We don't need to look further than Taiwan to see how fragile the world order is or how quickly everything could be turned on its head.  We have become sedated with netflix and chocolates.  We have been blind to the dangers of initiatives imposed on us by globalist elites who seek to undermine our way of life.  Diversity of opinion with in a population is healthy.  Diversity of peoples with ideologies in direct conflict with each other is the thing wars are made of.  Borders are to be respected, borders must be upheld.  Borders keep us us and our way of life safe.  The more the border between hong kong and China is eroded the more pain conflict and strive we will see.  The border separating Taiwan and China will only cause lose of life when it is eroded.  We must not let this happen.  We must stand on the side of democracy and freedom.   Democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to critique the government, these are things that could be wiped out in a heartbeat.  What has almost all of human history been of not tyranny of a minority over a majority.  <br />\n」[url][/url]"},{"pid":"31564ca688f6841fde82ff5f37fba48803843f56","tid":2018507,"uid":266959,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-15T16:02:46.000Z","msg":"廣傳支持！　＋１"},{"pid":"5f69d45f034160e4fb82fd70831dee98581c1f57","tid":2018507,"uid":266959,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-15T16:02:56.000Z","msg":"＋２"},{"pid":"8f384fdcf296d18c4e0d71809173dea841c0bba9","tid":2018507,"uid":266959,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-15T16:03:09.000Z","msg":"３"},{"pid":"044f64639f512338e11c4c25e2e924c9aa8f47ca","tid":2018507,"uid":266959,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-15T16:03:28.000Z","msg":"＋４"},{"pid":"9d7dbd62ac9452bd2b3db147f2471cc332fd56ff","tid":2018507,"uid":228337,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-15T16:07:09.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"49279b957aded113c2f9b6b03097eecdd41240c2","tid":2018507,"uid":266959,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-15T16:34:43.000Z","msg":"Christopher Hall"},{"pid":"5df11868841e91453f4ce16f1b1d89d423f63f7e","tid":2018507,"uid":266959,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-05-15T16:35:55.000Z","msg":"已課金<br />\npaypal 手續費～２０％，巨無恥．"}]}
