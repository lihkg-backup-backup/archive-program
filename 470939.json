His UK representative confirmed the news to the Guardian.<br />\n<br />\nGustav &Aring;hr, who grew up in Long Beach, New York, was found unresponsive by his manager on his tour bus. In a video &Aring;hr posted online hours before his death, he said he had taken prescription drugs and other substances, saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good, I&rsquo;m not sick&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nSgt Pete Dugan of the police department in Tucson stated to CNN: &ldquo;After speaking with people on scene and going into the tour bus... there was evidence of a possible drug overdose.&rdquo; He added that there was &ldquo;no sign of any kind of foul play&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nThe rap world has paid tribute to him, with Diplo writing on Twitter that &Aring;hr &ldquo;had so much more to do man he was constantly inspiring me&rdquo;, and fellow producer Marshmello writing: &ldquo;Peep was the nicest person. Hanging out with him, talking to him about music, the song ideas we were going to do together and touring was so amazing.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nChart-topping rapper Post Malone said &Aring;hr was &ldquo;a great friend to me and a great person. your music changed the world and it&rsquo;ll never be the same&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nFollowing a string of self-released mixtapes that blended cold trap production with highly emotional, soul-searching &ldquo;emo&rdquo; lyricism, and earned him a cult following, Lil Peep released his debut album Come Over When You&rsquo;re Sober (Part One) in August this year. His eye-catching dress sense and numerous tattoos also earned him attention in the fashion world &ndash; he did catwalk shows for the likes of Vlone, and Mario Testino photographed him for V magazine.<br />\n<br />\nSarah Stennett, the CEO of First Access Entertainment, a company who partnered with the rapper last year, said &ldquo;I am shocked and heartbroken. I do not believe Peep wanted to die, this is so tragic. He had huge ambition and his career was flourishing [...] I have spoken to his mother and she asked me to convey that she is very, very proud of him and everything he was able to achieve in his short life.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"20469c9a5e5e67618b9da66dcaf1a254b2fdf836","tid":470939,"uid":67016,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-16T19:58:48.000Z","msg":"Rip"},{"pid":"bd2cd4cf75b5587989e91218097e4e89919b4211","tid":470939,"uid":92407,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-17T03:37:54.000Z","msg":"Just another sound-cloud rapper"},{"pid":"0986711e493e55a222c060d6e65d8387c2797ae6","tid":470939,"uid":141177,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-17T10:50:33.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"5ac56fcba3f0179c1780002081b15962248e1bb9","tid":470939,"uid":18552,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-11-27T17:20:58.000Z","msg":"好鐘意佢d 歌 ,聽左一段時間先知佢。。。。。<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n唔知點解我覺得佢係自殺<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n<br />\n聽得出佢嘅歌有內心有幾咁sad<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c3bbdbaaebd0d188c9c4049171fe114709ea1234","tid":470939,"uid":15494,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-12-11T14:37:08.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
