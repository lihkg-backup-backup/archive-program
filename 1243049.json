Its minor-key melody is heard everywhere at the mass demonstrations against Hong Kong&rsquo;s controversial extradition bill and has become the movement&rsquo;s anthem.<br />\n<br />\nThe reason? Religious gatherings are exempt from the definition of a &ldquo;gathering&rdquo; or &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; under Hong Kong&rsquo;s Public Order Ordinance and are thus more difficult to police.<br />\n<br />\nThe Christian hymn was written by the Indiana-born Linda Stassen in 1974. According to the Complete Book of Hymns, Stassen was a follower of the Jesus People movement and wrote the song as an assignment for a music composition class, with the words inspired by the early Church. The song has since been included in many Christian hymnals, its popularity stemming from its austere, beautiful simplicity.<br />\n<br />\nProtestors young and old have joined in the singing of the song since taking to the streets on June 9 to oppose the contentious bill.<br />\n<br />\nThe proposed legislation would allow China to extradite fugitives from the semi-autonomous enclave for the first time. The bill&rsquo;s detractors say Beijing will use it to apprehend dissidents and critics of the communist regime, threatening the city&rsquo;s cherished freedoms.<br />\n<br />\nThe demonstrations have brought the busiest parts of the city to a standstill amid scenes reminiscent of the Umbrella Movement of 2014. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people have marched on two consecutive Sundays in a massive repudiation of Beijing. Organizers say that two million people participated in the last march, out of a population of seven million.<br />\n<br />\nThe demonstrations have prompted a suspension of the controversial bill and an apology from the city&rsquo;s top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, in the days after. Police have also retracted their earlier characterization of the demonstrations as a riot.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, until the bill is completely withdrawn, protesters vow to continue their actions&mdash;and their intonations of &ldquo;Sing Hallelujah to the Lord.&rdquo; Non-Christians have also enthusiastically taken up the hymn."},{"pid":"cf1b57633edbb5e7162a7a67a8b7285da88105d8","tid":1243049,"uid":50301,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-19T09:51:30.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://time.com/5608882/sing-hallelujah-to-the-lord-protestors-hong-kong-extradition-anthem/?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social-share-article&amp;utm_content=20190619\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F5608882%2Fsing-hallelujah-to-the-lord-protestors-hong-kong-extradition-anthem%2F%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook.com%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial-share-article%26utm_content%3D20190619&d=26VZ%2FvgZZ8DFpCmOvUDyu3za4IX%2BHJq2V8VgSm%2B5QfQ%3D&h=050fb58d\" target=\"_blank\">https://time.com/5608882/sing-hallelujah-to-the-lord-protestors-hong-kong-extradition-anthem/?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social-share-article&amp;utm_content=20190619</a>"},{"pid":"0a6e3c7af2fcdc22a66a15bf70a72005b9849ece","tid":1243049,"uid":228143,"like":1,"dislike":10,"score":-9,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-19T09:52:21.000Z","msg":"膠歌 暫援咪又係靠義士  靠首歌咩"},{"pid":"e8faa22f9229841f2320d4c4847e06e23484b8cb","tid":1243049,"uid":228143,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-19T09:52:56.000Z","msg":"唱歌得既話<br />\n<br />\n今天我一早得左啦"},{"pid":"c3e1524314e1072411d1219142504aed9cce6c06","tid":1243049,"uid":41245,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-19T09:53:13.000Z","msg":"一旦獨立咗會唔會變咗國歌<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b3ef5a4b03f3c50cc39ab45b12f15c1afc1e9c31","tid":1243049,"uid":53811,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-19T09:54:29.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\">打完飛機好沉post啦<br />\n你乜都爭取唔到呀，仲睇？<br />\n搵620 621遊戲攻略呀</span></span>"},{"pid":"a21fe697761e30c9a615b4cad69a9c0cd740edaf","tid":1243049,"uid":251872,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-06-19T09:58:04.000Z","msg":"開始扯唔起"}]}
