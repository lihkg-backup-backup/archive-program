America&rsquo;s political system &ndash; which was created to manage a much smaller, simpler, and homogenous nation &ndash; is clearly showing inadequacy in running the world&rsquo;s third most populous country whose citizenry is characterized by an ever increasing multitude of identities. <br />\n<br />\nThere is no doubt that America is gripped by epic struggle between opposing value sets. However, the fatalistic narrative of its irreconcilable divisions is overhyped. That bitter political cleavages nowadays often run through American families is certainly not a good thing for the country. But the good news is that the US appears to be avoiding the most dangerous kind of conflict, the one based on racial and ethno-religious affiliations. <br />\n<br />\nIt is telling that a larger percentage of every racial minority voted for Trump in 2020 than in 2016. Trump did especially well with Hispanics, the nation&rsquo;s largest minority.

That&rsquo;s why the most brutal conflicts are mostly caused by ethnic or religious antagonisms. In contrast, it is not impossible to eventually reach compromises over the issues like immigration or climate change that pit the Trumpists against the anti-Trump camp. Still, reaching a new societal compact will take a long time, maybe decades, whereas America&rsquo;s body politic needs the restoration of some semblance of unity and order now. The US political class is under pressure to come up with a quick fix to American disunity. It is highly likely the solution will be very simple and unoriginal: create an enemy. <br />\n<br />\nIt is a well-established precept in political philosophy &ndash; and an ancient principle of statecraft &ndash; that,<span class=\"red\"> for a viable political community to exist, it needs an existential enemy. </span>It was, in large part, thanks to the confrontation with &ldquo;communism&rdquo; embodied in the Soviet Union that America was able to maintain unity in the second half of the 20th century. As Samuel Huntington notes, <span class=\"red\">the demise of the Soviet Union left the United States without an enemy against which to define itself, resulting in the weakening of America&rsquo;s unitary identity.

Even if Putin stays on as the Russian leader, it will be an increasingly hard sell to present Russia as America&rsquo;s main foe. </span><br />\n<br />\nFor all the talk about the menace emanating from Putin&rsquo;s Russia, pretty much everyone in Washington knows who poses the most serious challenge to the US.
