We do not wish to split family units where there are <span class=\"x-large\">dependent</span> children over the age of 18, given the particular challenges linked to the timing of obtaining BN(O) status. In compelling and compassionate circumstances, we will therefore use discretion to grant a visa to the children of a BN(O) citizen who fall into this category and who are still <span class=\"x-large\">dependent</span> on the BN(O) citizen. We will limit this discretion ordinarily to children of BN(O) citizens who were born after the 1 July 1997 <span class=\"x-large\">who will also be able to apply as dependants</span>, if one of their parents holds BN(O) status and they apply together as a family unit. In exceptional circumstances of high dependency, other adult dependants of a BN(O) citizen applying for the visa may also be eligible at the UK Government&rsquo;s discretion, considered on a case by case basis. If the above doesn&rsquo;t apply then the existing youth mobility scheme is open to people in Hong Kong aged between 18-30, with 1000 places currently available each year. Individuals from Hong Kong will also be able to apply to come to the UK under the terms of the UK&rsquo;s new Points Based System, which will enable individuals to come to the UK in a wider range of professions and at a lower general salary threshold than in the past."},{"pid":"897a7b78c71137c7d19100779f7e546af46dd846","tid":2120275,"uid":78050,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-22T14:45:36.000Z","msg":"一齊住可能已經得?"}]}
