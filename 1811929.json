I will try to reach out to them in the coming days.<br />\n1. I&rsquo;ve been running a discussion channel to inform my international peers on the yellow side of the story, as the news most expats get from SCMP or foreign outlets leave a lot of the narrative out of the stories. Many other foreign students I speak to have gone to local protests or rallies only when clashes get intense as a way of sort of protest sightseeing (something I am really against). Many of the people I know are sympathetic but don&rsquo;t want to get involved in HK because they don&rsquo;t feel like it is their fight as well. I try and tell people that HK struggle is the same as the world&rsquo;s against authoritarianism and the CCP&rsquo;s international dominance, infiltration, and erosion of freedoms. However, many still can not resonate personally to involve themselves. I am currently back in the United States, where I have written about my experience and sent copies to journalists within my networks. Hopefully I will have something published soon to remind people here that they too are at risk and should stand with HK.<br />\n2. Many of the intl students I&rsquo;ve spoken to have taken this action and lobbied senators, with HKHRDA being passed, this is good. I hope HK issue and CCP stays on election agenda in the US for 2020.<br />\n3. I am in touch with friends who are well connected to EU governmental bodies and I will see if they can be of assistance in pressing this.<br />\n4. I personally do my best to boycott China-made products. However, I feel it is difficult because of how well integrated China is in global supply chain. Personally, I think the first step to make this meaningful is to create or establish Alibaba-like alternatives for the rest of Asia and emerging countries that can manufacture with similar quality, scale, and price as China. This will give options to retailers around the world to purchase non-Chinese goods and remain competitive.<br />\n5. Overall lobbying I will continue to try to do. It is difficult because I am not best connected yet. So right now I am trying to push on the public opinion side of things to promote awareness and support for HK abroad.<br />\n<br />\nThanks again for your suggestion and add oil!"},{"pid":"87aafe7cc2a4813dffa0e611f9858ef32977ac6e","tid":1811929,"uid":331963,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"854f96e84d0f3ad30bbcf639ff81005d68451164","tid":1811929,"uid":212944,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-01-15T02:24:25.000Z","msg":"First of all, i would like to express my gratitude.<br />\nRegarding your question- i would say the best thing to do is to boycott anything related to China<br />\nObviously it's very hard to stop using all products made in China<br />\nBut i would say it's a good start to delete apps made by Chinese companies like Tik Tok.<br />\nThere are a number of reasons. <br />\n1.

You may take the leadership role in organising and uniting the international students, who are also willing to help and support the freedom movement, both in your campus and other universities  to share the news, spread it out, hold seminars, participate in local rallies and protests.<br />\n2. International students could also lobby their senators and politicians to support the freedom movement in HK, such as condemning those human right violators like the HK police, HK government officials and CCP. <br />\n3. Encourage their countries to draw up something like Magnitsky Act or HK Human Right and Democracy Act in order to sanction those human right violators and even sanction HK or China in some ways. <br />\n4. Boycott China Global Movement&mdash;&mdash;this is in an initial stage. There&rsquo;s no doubt that China is imposing a global risk to other countries..... if you don&rsquo;t fight back now, your own national security will be at risk. We are proposing something economic related, but it could extend to academic and cultural involvement with China. ( you may read &ldquo;silent invasion&rdquo; to learn more how Australia was invaded by China in all aspects) <br />\n5. Try to lobby your country or other countries to offer assistance to Hongkongers who may need political asylum because of their involvement in this fight. Do you know some youngsters are in exile or they may be subjected to political persecution....it&rsquo;s sad but that&rsquo;s the truth in HK.....we definitely need more international support....<br />\n<br />\nThank you for your commitment! We need more people like you in this fight! We stand together!"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-01-15T22:07:53.000Z","msg":"Thank you so much for your suggestions! I had not heard of IAD yet. I will try to reach out to them in the coming days.<br />\n1. I&rsquo;ve been running a discussion channel to inform my international peers on the yellow side of the story, as the news most expats get from SCMP or foreign outlets leave a lot of the narrative out of the stories. Many other foreign students I speak to have gone to local protests or rallies only when clashes get intense as a way of sort of protest sightseeing (something I am really against). Many of the people I know are sympathetic but don&rsquo;t want to get involved in HK because they don&rsquo;t feel like it is their fight as well. I try and tell people that HK struggle is the same as the world&rsquo;s against authoritarianism and the CCP&rsquo;s international dominance, infiltration, and erosion of freedoms. However, many still can not resonate personally to involve themselves. I am currently back in the United States, where I have written about my experience and sent copies to journalists within my networks. Hopefully I will have something published soon to remind people here that they too are at risk and should stand with HK.<br />\n2. Many of the intl students I&rsquo;ve spoken to have taken this action and lobbied senators, with HKHRDA being passed, this is good. I hope HK issue and CCP stays on election agenda in the US for 2020.<br />\n3. I am in touch with friends who are well connected to EU governmental bodies and I will see if they can be of assistance in pressing this.<br />\n4. I personally do my best to boycott China-made products. However, I feel it is difficult because of how well integrated China is in global supply chain. Personally, I think the first step to make this meaningful is to create or establish Alibaba-like alternatives for the rest of Asia and emerging countries that can manufacture with similar quality, scale, and price as China. This will give options to retailers around the world to purchase non-Chinese goods and remain competitive.<br />\n5. Overall lobbying I will continue to try to do. It is difficult because I am not best connected yet. So right now I am trying to push on the public opinion side of things to promote awareness and support for HK abroad.<br />\n<br />\nThanks again for your suggestion and add oil!"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-16T13:04:27.000Z","msg":"4.

As citizens, we boycott made-in-China product out of principle and solidarity, hoping that will make a statement and influence more people around us. In order to take it a step further, one should consider lobbying politicians in his country to review its China policies, you might consider suggesting it to your friends who have connection with EU government bodies."},{"pid":"22772410d971d9e0e802908523c82eb2bd725389","tid":1811929,"uid":212944,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"87aafe7cc2a4813dffa0e611f9858ef32977ac6e","tid":1811929,"uid":331963,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"854f96e84d0f3ad30bbcf639ff81005d68451164","tid":1811929,"uid":212944,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-01-15T02:24:25.000Z","msg":"First of all, i would like to express my gratitude.<br />\nRegarding your question- i would say the best thing to do is to boycott anything related to China<br />\nObviously it's very hard to stop using all products made in China<br />\nBut i would say it's a good start to delete apps made by Chinese companies like Tik Tok.<br />\nThere are a number of reasons. <br />\n1.
