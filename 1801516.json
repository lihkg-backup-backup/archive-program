Modi on Wednesday blamed the demonstrators for vandalism, saying those who were misled and caused damage to public property &ldquo;should sit at home and ask themselves if their path was right.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe Indian Express report may spark fears that the state is using the police to prevent democratic protests against a law that bars undocumented Muslims from three neighboring nations seeking Indian citizenship, but allows people of other faiths to do so.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPolice in New Delhi -- controlled by Modi&rsquo;s federal government -- are focused on &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; and have used &ldquo;extensive archival videography and behavior analysis&rdquo; to identify suspects, the newspaper cited an unidentified spokesperson as saying. Police fed footage of public protests venues to the face-recognition software to identify suspects after receiving intelligence of possible disruptions at Modi&rsquo;s rally, the report said, citing the spokesperson."},{"pid":"30903cfbfea3aa74d0f29e6434faa31821ae10b6","tid":1801516,"uid":305536,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-28T16:42:47.000Z","msg":"[召喚] 簽名師唔該全面進場 (你地自己睇下羞唔羞恥)<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1800386\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1800386</a><br />\n<br />\n上水和你shop聽日仲有<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1801500\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1801500</a>"},{"pid":"3f7028181016212ce6d1e416dbaa6f6b7a6d5145","tid":1801516,"uid":317233,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-28T16:49:35.000Z","msg":"<strong><span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\">和你shop 升級：熱情香港 好客之道 又點少得你！<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1801116\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1801116</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/big/bouncy.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></span></strong>"},{"pid":"04bcb17ca8975136bd34fe84a031d5cf4535e3c0","tid":1801516,"uid":235152,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-28T16:57:58.000Z","msg":"面具將是抗爭必要工具<img src=\"/assets/faces/xm/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ac0e1ba8542e81e078d109f86e13cff374799f4e","tid":1801516,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-12-29T07:15:42.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/pigxm/angry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
