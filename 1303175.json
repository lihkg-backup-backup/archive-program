I was panicking the whole time from May to July, anxiously waiting for the results because I thought I screwed up big time, I even applied to a high diploma program. On that day, my parents drove me to school and I kind of just lost it when I was in the car and I kept crying. I tried to get it together to walked to the classroom and get my results. When I got my report card, I cried again, but those tears are happy tears - I got 2 5**! In both Chinese and English. I still rmb that feeling to this day, and I can't believe it has been 4 years already and now I am almost done with college.
