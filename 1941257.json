My advice to all those media commentators who think they know better than President Trump would be, &quot;Stop embarrassing yourselves.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nLet's look at the approach to North Korea from previous presidents.<br />\n<br />\nBill Clinton's strategy1 was to give North Korea two nuclear reactors and $4.5 billion dollars as long as North Korea promised not to use the technology to create nuclear missiles. Surprise, surprise, North Korea later admitted they started researching nuclear warfare technology the very day they got the reactors.<br />\n<br />\nObama's strategy was to stick his head in the sand, order the media to keep quiet2, and hope the problem would go away. Surprise, surprise, the problem didn't go away.<br />\n<br />\nFortunately we now have a leader who understands the art of war. After all it was only a few months ago that Trump took on the democrats, the Deep State, the establishment Republicans, and almost the entire media, and still came out victorious.<br />\n<br />\nOn a final note, here's a relevant video of President Trump talking about the North Korea problem as far back as 1999.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjXZNJ50GN0\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXjXZNJ50GN0&d=Afoh3Yf6cz19ESyehd0SJ1TAjexNHzxSh3iQmMoU3XE%3D&h=3f4821da\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjXZNJ50GN0</a><br />\n<br />\n#TheArtOfWar<br />\n<br />\n- - - - - - - - - -<br />\n<br />\nLinks:<br />\n1 <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/01/06/you-can-thank-jimmy-carter-and-bill-clinton-for-north-koreas-nukes/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2016%2F01%2F06%2Fyou-can-thank-jimmy-carter-and-bill-clinton-for-north-koreas-nukes%2F&d=Afoh3Yf6cz19ESyehd0SJ1TAjexNHzxSh3iQmMoU3XE%3D&h=36843592\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://nypost.com/2016/01/06/you-can-thank-jimmy-carter-and-bill-clinton-for-north-koreas-nukes/</a><br />\n2 <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/08/09/obama-administration-knew-about-north-koreas-miniaturized-nukes.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fopinion%2F2017%2F08%2F09%2Fobama-administration-knew-about-north-koreas-miniaturized-nukes.html&d=Afoh3Yf6cz19ESyehd0SJ1TAjexNHzxSh3iQmMoU3XE%3D&h=719bcf94\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fopinion%2F2017%2F08%2F09%2Fobama-administration-knew-about-north-koreas-miniaturized-nukes.html&h=5ec86e3f\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/08/09/obama-administration-knew-about-north-koreas-miniaturized-nukes.html</a>"},{"pid":"93e90682f357f6cb65b900bcbe854beb3fa62f6b","tid":1941257,"uid":177089,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T10:07:18.000Z","msg":"佢好中意"},{"pid":"ad006fa236c11bf61a174beb23c4923210a1f20b","tid":1941257,"uid":282637,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"93e90682f357f6cb65b900bcbe854beb3fa62f6b","tid":1941257,"uid":177089,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T10:07:18.000Z","msg":"佢好中意"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T10:11:24.000Z","msg":"好有心得?"},{"pid":"f949064150cc05b10526a0041ac848c65cf272d5","tid":1941257,"uid":177089,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"ad006fa236c11bf61a174beb23c4923210a1f20b","tid":1941257,"uid":282637,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"93e90682f357f6cb65b900bcbe854beb3fa62f6b","tid":1941257,"uid":177089,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T10:07:18.000Z","msg":"佢好中意"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T10:11:24.000Z","msg":"好有心得?"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-24T10:13:30.000Z","msg":"中意up"}]}
