Lydon announced today that she hosted a discussion entitled, &ldquo;China&rsquo;s Threat to Our National Security: An Economic and Private Sector Perspective.&rdquo;  The discussion featured William R. Evanina, Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) in Washington, DC......and legislators about China&rsquo;s threats to our nation&rsquo;s economic prosperity.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">More than 90% of the Department of Justice&rsquo;s cases alleging economic espionage over the past seven years involved China.  Over two-thirds of the Department&rsquo;s cases involving thefts of trade secrets are connected to China</span></span>. The talk aimed to educate attendees about economic threats posed by China, build bridges between law enforcement and law-abiding members of the business community, and ensure that attendees and their employers know that the federal government stands ready to help should they face data breaches, insider threats, or trade secret theft. <br />\n<br />\n &ldquo;The Department of Justice and the FBI will use all available tools to respond to China&rsquo;s economic aggression and the threat that these actions pose to the prosperity and security of the United States and other nations that respect the rule of law,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Lydon.  &ldquo;Law enforcement cannot fight this battle alone, however.  We need our corporate citizens to be informed and vigilant about protecting themselves from victimization in this area.  The conversation we had today is just the first step in what will be an ongoing dialogue with the business community.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\n#####<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sc/pr/united-states-attorney-lydon-hosts-discussion-china-s-threat-america-s-national-security\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.justice.gov%2Fusao-sc%2Fpr%2Funited-states-attorney-lydon-hosts-discussion-china-s-threat-america-s-national-security&d=WTugOjWmLb2R3dS25JBA%2BZdwtLMCc893KahbJtTxKsc%3D&h=7b4fad8e\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.justice.gov/usao-sc/pr/united-states-attorney-lydon-hosts-discussion-china-s-threat-america-s-national-security</a>"},{"pid":"4459cb5217abdd963107ab66a1f108322c748975","tid":1059336,"uid":511,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-03-13T05:50:30.000Z","msg":"支蟲男盜女娼<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a532e56339049901aa3a8e31944b24b4a7c7ae3c","tid":1059336,"uid":27451,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-03-13T05:53:12.000Z","msg":"美國佬引蝗入關，自己捉蟲入屎忽，怪得誰?"}]}
