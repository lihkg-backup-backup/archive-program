It has yet to be approved by the Senate but is expected to pass.<br />\n<br />\n好學唔學學加拿大個位Peoplekind總理 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/clown4.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/clown4.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/clown4.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7d8dc40ecec67286d82fccba73922a518bc0855a","tid":1028075,"uid":153689,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-19T09:00:02.000Z","msg":"就算我本身支持開LGBT權利都覺得好怪<br />\n明明可以同小朋友解釋清楚嘅事，但係要揀一條更複雜嘅路，根本矯枉過正"},{"pid":"1d05053da6a85820827aa7e45b5dcce70f29fa88","tid":1028075,"uid":61271,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-19T09:16:52.000Z","msg":"點解無parent 3?<br />\n又玩歧視<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
