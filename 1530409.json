Recently my friend in Taiwan asked me &quot;Why do so many HK expats hate the protestors?&quot;<br />\n<br />\nI said &quot;Huh?!&quot;<br />\n<br />\nFinally, I can understand why he asked it. He had tried to read the comments section of the newspaper. And was tricked 🤦<br />\n<br />\n&quot;But their English is so good!&quot;<br />\n<br />\nNo it's not!.... it's fake &quot;good English&quot; that has strong mainland characteristics. Warning signs:<br />\n<br />\n--overuse of English colloquialisms, i.e. trying to appear idiomatic. A normal person just writes directly<br />\n<br />\n--essay-style logic: &quot;A then B, therefore C&quot;. Anyone could do this, but the Chinese bots do it again and again! And with really twisted logic<br />\n<br />\n--&quot;we Hong Kongers&quot; &quot;we expats&quot; &quot;we Americans&quot;... a normal person commenting probably wouldn't try to represent others like this<br />\n<br />\n--similarly: loudly claiming to be American/German/Malaysian etc. i.e. not Chinese. Normal people would not bring this up unless it is totally relevant<br />\n<br />\n--defending China's honour. This one is obvious 🤣... what person on the face of Earth would defend the mainland... except mainlanders 😅<br />\n<br />\nCan you think of some other warning signs?<br />\n<br />\nLong post, thanks for reading. 香港加油！"},{"pid":"da4550b1d56985532e6b8d075c549f3fa764ef05","tid":1530409,"uid":259345,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-02T03:06:10.000Z","msg":"大埔何中要人<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n急！大埔富善邨何中校長 聲稱會將罷課學生資料交給教育局 已fact check<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1530398\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1530398</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"ddb6e8266c56c6bc9d51f5b5fbcfe292886c8718","tid":1530409,"uid":112812,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-03T13:21:38.000Z","msg":"Kwong Fuk Heung Gong"},{"pid":"139a92631df056482352f2f14cf067fd173ae197","tid":1530409,"uid":112812,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-03T13:29:47.000Z","msg":"<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>9月7日 (六) 1PM<br />\n機場交通壓力測試 (重考)</strong></div><br />\n<br />\n香港市民：<br />\n✅ 以遊客身份入機場觀賞飛機升降 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/love.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n✅ 唔識路就坐多幾轉車 <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/cook.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n✅ 必需繳付車資乘坐黨鐵<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/wet.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/lick.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n其他國藉居民：<br />\n各有各做, 自由發揮 <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/sowhat.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/nyixFQQ.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FnyixFQQ.png&h=cc1f24a6&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>9月8日 (日) 2PM<br />\n香港人權與民主法案集會<br />\n美國駐港澳總領事館</strong></div><br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/2GKH20p.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2F2GKH20p.png&h=6178433f&s={SIZE}\" />"}]}
