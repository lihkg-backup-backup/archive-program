As with dictatorships throughout history, no lie is too obscene, so long as it serves the Party&rsquo;s lust for power. This laughable propaganda should not fool anyone.<br />\n<br />\nThe contrast between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could not be more stark.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>In China, when a church burns, the attack was almost certainly directed by the CCP. In America, when a church burns, the arsonists are punished by the government, and it is the government that brings fire trucks, water, aid, and comfort to the faithful.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>In China, peaceful protesters from Hong Kong to Tiananmen Square are clubbed by armed militiamen for simply speaking out. Reporters writing of these indignities are sentenced to long terms in prison. In the United States, law enforcement &ndash; both state and federal &ndash; brings rogue officers to justice, welcomes peaceful protests while forcefully shutting down looting and violence, and exercises power pursuant to the Constitution to protect property and liberty for all. Our free press covers events wall to wall, for all the world to see.</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn China, when doctors and journalists warn of the dangers of a new disease, the CCP silences and disappears them, and lies about death totals and the extent of the outbreak. In the United States, we value life and build transparent systems to treat, cure, and underwrite &ndash; more than any other nation &ndash; pandemic solutions for the globe.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>In China, when citizens hold opinions that diverge from CCP dogma, the Party imprisons them in re-education camps. And, when people &ndash; such as those in Hong Kong and Taiwan &ndash; with common roots in an awe-inspiring civilization that has endured for thousands of years embrace freedom, that freedom is crushed, and the people subordinated to Party dictates and demands. In the United States, in contrast, even amidst reckless rioting, we demonstrate our robust commitment to the rule of law, transparency, and unalienable human rights.</strong><br />\n<br />\nBeijing in recent days has showcased its continuing contempt for the truth and scorn for law. The CCP&rsquo;s propaganda efforts &ndash; seeking to conflate the United States&rsquo; actions in the wake of the death of George Floyd with the CCP&rsquo;s continued denial of basic human rights and freedom &ndash; should be seen for the fraud that they are.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the best of times, the PRC ruthlessly imposes communism. Amid the most difficult challenges, the United States secures freedom."},{"pid":"c7ccf56fb7182441f1596e96124c89a14d12b7fc","tid":2054085,"uid":22609,"like":11,"dislike":0,"score":11,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T00:47:00.000Z","msg":"蓬佩奧強調，兩國差異非常明顯，舉例說香港及北京天安門廣場的和平示威者，會被武裝人員攻擊，記者會被扣押。而在美國，當局歡迎和平示威，<strong><span style=\"color: red;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">執法部門的害群之馬會被繩之於法</span></span></strong>，當局亦會打擊暴力及搶掠事件，行使憲法的權力，保障所有人的財產與自由，記者可以自由採訪。<br />\n<br />\nRthk news <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n直線抽擊<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/cook.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"25b5f524442249a3bef81aaba06416aa75e4781c","tid":2054085,"uid":91397,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T00:47:44.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d25c21c78762996102dd7a8d13f7571d82901e38","tid":2054085,"uid":127575,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T00:57:17.000Z","msg":"777 : <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6bfed16961f11e4f061c13bc8052f5e944d67857","tid":2054085,"uid":3149,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T00:58:25.000Z","msg":"Push <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5bbe71465d5b01bec300d151b4cea98a6b8c6bcc","tid":2054085,"uid":151074,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:01:04.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/fight_connect.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c9061588a0bc3a754ca16e649376b58407992c2e","tid":2054085,"uid":321837,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:02:04.000Z","msg":"支那係掟人落樓,由新疆到香港都係咁玩<br />\n美國係聽都未聽過. 你問下ANTIFA聽過可以咁玩未, 若然係咁玩,佢地會幾崩潰先?"},{"pid":"0133d338ab286d3937f67872b8fcb32347fb99d4","tid":2054085,"uid":51271,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:06:10.000Z","msg":"同埋，而家香港發生既事件，起碼美英台係當8964處理"},{"pid":"5ba2a96493185d1af0b7405ae5a96c27a590cbca","tid":2054085,"uid":205927,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:07:29.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />岩"},{"pid":"72148acbcbe97784a02cf19aa5d0d7ad7478ca38","tid":2054085,"uid":216993,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T01:10:56.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/05.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"91a7a3c0ce2ef2e64ca9e044c96143e059406e67","tid":2054085,"uid":126889,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-07T06:24:55.000Z","msg":"抵美利堅強大<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
