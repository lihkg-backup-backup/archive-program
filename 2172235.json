On the other hand, people aged 75 and over have a death rate 80 times that. For people under 18 years old, the rate of death is zero per 100,000.<br />\n<br />\nOf all fatal cases in New York state, two-thirds were in patients over 70 years of age; more than 95 percent were over 50 years of age; and about 90 percent of all fatal cases had an underlying illness. Of 6,570 confirmed COVID-19 deaths fully investigated for underlying conditions to date, 6,520, or 99.2 percent, had an underlying illness. If you do not already have an underlying chronic condition, your chances of dying are small, regardless of age. And young adults and children in normal health have almost no risk of any serious illness from COVID-19.<br />\n<br />\nFact 2: Protecting older, at-risk people eliminates hospital overcrowding.<br />\n<br />\nWe can learn about hospital utilization from data from New York City, the hotbed of COVID-19 with more than 34,600 hospitalizations to date. For those under 18 years of age, hospitalization from the virus is 0.01 percent, or 11 per 100,000 people; for those 18 to 44 years old, hospitalization is 0.1 percent. Even for people ages 65 to 74, only 1.7 percent were hospitalized. Of 4,103 confirmed COVID-19 patients with symptoms bad enough to seek medical care, Dr. Leora Horwitz of NYU Medical Center concluded &quot;age is far and away the strongest risk factor for hospitalization.&quot; Even early WHO reports noted that 80 percent of all cases were mild, and more recent studies show a far more widespread rate of infection and lower rate of serious illness. Half of all people testing positive for infection have no symptoms at all. The vast majority of younger, otherwise healthy people do not need significant medical care if they catch this infection."},{"pid":"6dae204e7ab26d6cf42ea10c15044cb4aeaeb18c","tid":2172235,"uid":251026,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-08-24T17:06:53.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/videos/631676824442637/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FDonaldTrump%2Fvideos%2F631676824442637%2F&d=HUgUlm9NWlnA9xfyBh3Sbp1eSlELYVUX4DDX6cHIoDA%3D&h=17c2fcf8\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/videos/631676824442637/</a><br />\n<br />\n一早有藥醫Covid19，不過比建制㩒住咗，強迫所有國家跟住lockdown"}]}
