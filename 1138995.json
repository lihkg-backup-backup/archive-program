The extremely high frequencies in 5G are where the biggest danger lies. While 4G frequencies go as high as 6 GHz, 5G exposes biological life to pulsed signals in the 30 GHz to 100 GHz range. The general public has never before been exposed to such high frequencies for long periods of time.<br />\n<br />\n <img src=\"https://na.cx/i/Oft8oTv.png\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FOft8oTv.png&h=41903d00&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nThis is a big deal.<strong> It turns out that our eyes and our sweat ducts act as antennas for absorption of the higher-frequency 5G waves. And because the distances these high-energy waves can travel is relatively short, transmitters will be required closer to homes and schools than earlier wireless technologies: the build-out will add the equivalent of a cell tower every 2-10 houses.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>The &ldquo;medical people&rdquo; have conducted over 2,000 international evidence-based studies that link health impacts with pulsed radiowave radiation from cell towers, routers, cell phones, tablets, and other wireless devices. <span style=\"color: red;\">These studies tell us that RF radiation is harmful at even low and short exposures, and that it impacts children and fetuses more rapidly than adults</span>.</strong> Among the findings are that RF radiation is carcinogenic, causes DNA damage, affects fertility and the endocrine system, and has neurological impacts. Pulsed electromagnetic frequencies have also been shown to cause neurological symptoms: depression, anxiety, headaches, muscle pain, attention deficits, insomnia, dizziness, tinnitus, skin tingling, loss of appetite, and nausea.<br />\n<br />\nThe U.S. Government has known of these risks since at least 1971, when the Naval Medical Research and Development Command published a bibliography containing 3,700 references reporting 100 biological and clinical effects attributed to microwave and radio-frequency radiation.<br />\n<br />\nRecent findings, such as the $30 million 2018 U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) Study, have corroborated the findings of all well-designed heart and brain cancer studies of people with 10 or more years&rsquo; exposure to cellular radiation from cell towers and cell phones.<strong><span style=\"color: red;\"> They all agree: RF radiation causes cancer.</span></strong>"},{"pid":"0c3645eb67b1ba7a3ed6b07496ed430544041fb0","tid":1138995,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-05-05T02:19:23.000Z","msg":"What has been the response to these findings?<br />\n<br />\nS<strong>cientists are urging the World Health Organization (WHO) to update its classification of RF from a Group 2B Carcinogen to a Class 1 carcinogen &ndash; making RF and 5G comparable to arsenic and asbestos</strong>. Annie Sasco, former Chief of WHO&rsquo;s Research Unit of Epidemiology for Cancer Prevention, says, &ldquo;Enough is enough, how many more deaths would be needed before serious action is taken? Evidence just continues to accumulate.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nRonald Melnick, the designer of the NTP study, says that the study &ldquo;<strong>shows clear evidence of a causal link between cancer and exposure to wireless cell phone signals</strong>.&rdquo; He adds that &ldquo;An important lesson that should be learned from the NTP studies is that w<strong>e can no longer assume that any current or future wireless technology, including 5G, is safe without adequate testing.</strong>&rdquo;[5] Meanwhile, 231 scientists from 42 nations have signed the 5G Appeal, which urgently calls for a moratorium on the technology. Steps are being taken to slow the deployment of 5G in Italy, Belgium, Israel, Switzerland, and The Netherlands, and in the states of California, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Oregon.<br />\n<br />\nBut so far, not enough political leaders have been willing to heed the warnings. Or perhaps they are deferring to President Trump, who said that 5G antennas &ldquo;must cover every community and they must be deployed as soon as possible&hellip;. No matter where you are you will have 5G and it is going to be a different life. I don&rsquo;t know that it will be better&hellip; but I can say that technologically it won&rsquo;t even be close.&rdquo;[6]<br />\n<br />\nWireless technology has become so ubiquitous that most of us have been lulled into believing it is safe. Now, the hazards are about to be ratcheted up dramatically. More citizens and legislators need to join those who are actively resisting the reckless push for 5G.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-05-04/5g-worth-risks\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zerohedge.com%2Fnews%2F2019-05-04%2F5g-worth-risks&d=u%2FngHNJi%2FtIBC1CiWprX8Za0YVntLK4LebkCjpCDSOM%3D&h=13e841c8\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-05-04/5g-worth-risks</a>"}]}
