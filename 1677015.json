The latest events and trends that affect Hong Kong - from the corridors of power and business boardrooms, to the streets and dai pai dongs. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;The Pulse&quot; is politics. What's happening in the Legislative Council and on the streets right now. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;The Pulse&quot; is the media, informing us how well or badly our press and broadcast organisations diagnose and reflect the society around us. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;The Pulse&quot; is insightful, in-depth reports and interviews on current issues - examining those issues in depth, looking behind and beyond the news. <br />\n<br />\nIts focus is on the timely. The Now.<br />\n<br />\nKeep your eye ... and your finger ... on &quot;The Pulse&quot;. <br />\n<br />\nIf you want to discuss anything you've seen in &quot;The Pulse&quot;, or anything in the public eye right now, or just to talk about the show, why not join in the debate on our Facebook page, RTHK's The Pulse. <br />\n<br />\nThe programme is aired every Saturday on RTHK 31 at 18:00. <br />\n<br />\nWe're on Facebook <br />\nRTHK's The Pulse <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RTHK.Pulse/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRTHK.Pulse%2F&d=HXPWCXSY8fSkht0R8v8uOXRNzM9MViFDfs2457H6WAQ%3D&h=de337bc7\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/RTHK.Pulse/</a><br />\nInstagram @rthkthepulse<br />\nTwitter @thepulse_rthk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thepulse_rthk\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fthepulse_rthk&d=HXPWCXSY8fSkht0R8v8uOXRNzM9MViFDfs2457H6WAQ%3D&h=e63dc8d4\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/thepulse_rthk</a> <br />\n<br />\nArchive available later after broadcast. ** Please note that the programme air-time on TV is different with webcast time.<br />\n</span>"},{"pid":"2b5d2a6a2558db113ecbd3afd56e58769f02b4c8","tid":1677015,"uid":34119,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-28T20:33:43.000Z","msg":"push"},{"pid":"4607cb5644f8148b25c099f030867b81f9bf470e","tid":1677015,"uid":71447,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-28T21:16:03.000Z","msg":"Remember Remember<br />\nThe fifth of November"}]}
