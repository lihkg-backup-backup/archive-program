One of the frontline occupiers was a Mr. Tsui in his twenties, an interview of whom was published in Chinese in StandNews on 2019-7-12. Tsui confessed that he has no future, that he is ready to die for the resistance movement and for the young of HK. &quot;We are egg shells who're prepared to be cracked and to charge.&quot; He recalled how he became a valiant actionist, going through his experience with the 2014 Umbrella and 2016 Fishball Revolutions. He pointed out that even the Chief Executive Carrie Lam sort of admitted the effectiveness of valiant activism. He recaptured his mixed feelings in storming into the Legco and how he and his comrades damaged only significant symbols inside. &quot;Why should our society force kids, including a 13-year-old, to risk being charged with rioting?!&quot; Tsui asked in agony. Below please find HKBNews' English summary of Tsui's words. <br />\n<br />\nFB: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/729490997488667?__tn__=-R\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhongkongbilingualnews%2Fposts%2F729490997488667%3F__tn__%3D-R&d=ev%2BvVaAtQ3cORw7W3wlzWbCEdHrHTgyyxjjYSTVVVd4%3D&h=811bc715\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/hongkongbilingualnews/posts/729490997488667?__tn__=-R</a><br />\n<br />\nWeb link: <a href=\"https://www.hongkongbilingualnews.com/post/confessions-of-a-frontline-occupier-of-hong-kong-legco-by-chapman-chen-hkbnews\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hongkongbilingualnews.com%2Fpost%2Fconfessions-of-a-frontline-occupier-of-hong-kong-legco-by-chapman-chen-hkbnews&d=ev%2BvVaAtQ3cORw7W3wlzWbCEdHrHTgyyxjjYSTVVVd4%3D&h=82d277db\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.hongkongbilingualnews.com/post/confessions-of-a-frontline-occupier-of-hong-kong-legco-by-chapman-chen-hkbnews</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n#HongKongLegislativeCouncil #rioting #extraditionlaw #ccp #communistchina #carrielam #maga2020 #donaldtrump #chapmanchen #hongkongbilingualnews #HKBNews #keepamericagreat #hongkongactivism #hongkongresistance #umbrellamovement #occupycentralmovement"}]}
