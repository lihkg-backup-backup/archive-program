It is a disgrace that they have been invited to buy even more.&rdquo;</strong><br />\n<br />\nHong Kong is in the midst of its worst political crisis since the British handover of the territory to China in 1997. During the protests, which began in opposition to a now suspended extradition law, almost 2,000 rounds of teargas have been fired.<br />\n<br />\nCanisters recovered by protesters show that some of the CS gas used had been manufactured by a British company, Chemring, at a factory in Derby, which partly prompted Jeremy Hunt to announce the export ban. Britain had licensed &pound;9.4m of arms sales and security equipment to Hong Kong since 2014.<br />\n<br />\nThe then foreign secretary, who was sacked last month by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had declared that no export licences to Hong Kong would be approved until concerns about human rights abuses were &ldquo;thoroughly addressed&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nBut the list published by the DIT of delegations invited on 23 July &ndash; Hunt&rsquo;s last full day as foreign secretary &ndash; names Hong Kong, as well as eight countries identified by the Foreign Office as a &ldquo;priority country&rdquo; in its latest annual review of human rights and democracy.<br />\n<br />\nThey include Saudi Arabia, where a failure by British ministers to consider the impact of civilian casualties in Yemen from bombing by the country&rsquo;s air force has led to the court of appeal declaring that UK exports had been conducted unlawfully until a proper assessment is carried out.<br />\n<br />\nAnother is Bahrain. This week two staff from the Gulf state&rsquo;s embassy in London were accused of assaulting an activist who climbed to the roof of the five-storey building in Belgravia, in protest against the pending execution of two men. The embassy has denied the claim.<br />\n<br />\nThe remaining six human rights priority countries invited by the DIT to the DSEI are Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Israel, Pakistan and Uzbekistan.<br />\n<br />\nLloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour MP, said: &ldquo;The government&rsquo;s approved attendees are eerily similar to its official list of human rights abusers ... I presume this is what Johnson means by global Britain.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe size and importance of the national delegations vary, but some are substantial and include senior figures able to make purchasing decisions. Over 1,600 exhibitors are expected to be present at the event at London&rsquo;s Excel centre, which will also feature 40 &ldquo;international pavilions&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\nThe Department for International Trade said: &ldquo;The invitation does not imply that any future export licences would be granted to Hong Kong.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"9428350e7e2f1618fd9a5fa36a7b7c6fe95d7635","tid":1438419,"uid":134071,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-09T18:18:33.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"2ac5393e2dee7c65c0ca50de39c607007db76589","tid":1438419,"uid":140924,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-09T18:23:35.000Z","msg":"UK has become a joke <img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\nBrexit搵左個Boris Johnson出嚟真係睇下點死<br />\n咁多位手足我地繼續努力<img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"744c16a73d62263bdd7eb92fd59fd56668ef98b0","tid":1438419,"uid":134071,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-09T18:24:25.000Z","msg":"打兩手?<br />\n<br />\n英國外交大臣: 香港政府應成立「獨立調查委員會」<br />\n<a href=\"https://lihkg.com/thread/1438429/page/1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lihkg.com/thread/1438429/page/1</a>"},{"pid":"3a9eeca9875cbb340aa53d8f869073414a9e5604","tid":1438419,"uid":124806,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-15T05:31:51.000Z","msg":"似係撚狗<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n有武器禁運令<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"854676bc17972ac3da00a3076d503de1cfd89559","tid":1438419,"uid":13724,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-15T05:33:37.000Z","msg":"即係點， 有得睇無得買？"},{"pid":"058287f0cf26b9c736f2b7f51a40f4438a9cf855","tid":1438419,"uid":87735,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"3a9eeca9875cbb340aa53d8f869073414a9e5604","tid":1438419,"uid":124806,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-15T05:31:51.000Z","msg":"似係撚狗<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n有武器禁運令<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-15T05:34:42.000Z","msg":"落晒訂<br />\n然後禁運 <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/clap.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0017f8c47de02c7f4bfecf7c8fcf0e61b1c864a7","tid":1438419,"uid":143987,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-15T06:00:54.000Z","msg":"展示力量?<br />\n好似軍演咁?"}]}
