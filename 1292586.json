Don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s a good bet that the Japanese yen 💴 will continue falling so you may as well go on a trip to Osaka this summer. The sun has been dazzlingly bright there. You might just as well go for an outdoor onsen soaking up the sun (by the way I&rsquo;ve just got out of an onsen and am drying myself on a towel)I enjoy going to the annual winter carnival 🎡 and going on the thrill rides and eating pancakes 🥞 and sushi 🍣 soaking up the nice Christmassy atmosphere. Several years ago I saw X japan live in Osaka Dome Stadium 🏟 which was absolutely incredible and unforgettable. They&rsquo;ve been strutting their stuff since they were young. Even though they&rsquo;re past their prime they&rsquo;re still excellent musicians so don&rsquo;t sell them short ! At the end of the last encore, they bowed onstage soaking up the applause 👏🏻 They were given a thunderous standing ovation. The drummer took part in a three thousand metre race a few years ago where he came first. He rose to the challenge, ran for all he was worth and dived over the finish line 🏁 passing the runner 🏃🏻&zwj;♀️ who was ahead of him earlier. Hundreds of people congratulated him on winning the race as he held the trophy 🏆 up. The race was the opportunity for all the world&rsquo;s best runners to strut their stuff. It was truly memorable. I work at Hotel JAP Osaka. My friend Alex received a commission for a sculpture from the hotel 🏨 I congratulated him on having been commissioned to make a sculpture for the hotel because it&rsquo;s a once in a lifetime opportunity. Another friend of mine who works for the hotel was assigned to the company&rsquo;s branch in Hokkaido with which he is really pleased. I too am pleased about his promotion. Feel free to come to our hotel 🏨 and say hi. 😊"}]}
