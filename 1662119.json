The most urgent issue of Hong Kong protesters is to gain more and more international support. More people (especially governor) willing to speak up, more pressure to the Chinese and HK government. The image of CCP will also be destroyed. It means that the CCP are going to use more RMB to buy back their image and it will actually harm the CCP economy.<br />\n<br />\nIf you are willing to act effectively for helping Hong Kong, the followings are my own suggestions:<br />\n1. Stop purchasing any kind of Chinese product or service<br />\n2. Encourage your governor to condemn the CCP and HK government<br />\n3. Vote the governor you believed that he or she really value on the democracy<br />\n4. Participate in the global march<br />\n<br />\nLiberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times!"},{"pid":"a11f2ffdc9da5234349fce4d455223a93413a01a","tid":1662119,"uid":314509,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-19T15:01:50.000Z","msg":"check this post for some ideas:<br />\n<br />\nWays to stand with Hong Kong<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1663702\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1663702</a>"}]}
