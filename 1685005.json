policy makers are gathered in Beijing for a key political meeting that&rsquo;s set to conclude on Thursday. In meetings ahead of that plenum some officials have relayed low expectations that future negotiations could result in anything meaningful -- unless the U.S. is willing to roll back more of the tariffs. In some cases, they&rsquo;ve urged American visitors to carry that very message back to Washington, the people said.<br />\n<br />\nChilean President Sebastian Pinera threw up another hurdle when he announced Wednesday that the country had canceled the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit Nov. 16-17 -- where Trump and China&rsquo;s Xi Jinping hoped to meet -- because of social unrest in the country.<br />\n<br />\nU.S. stocks futures and government bond yields declined.<br />\n<br />\nA White House spokesman said Wednesday, after the news of the cancellation, that the administration remains committed to &ldquo;finalizing Phase One of the historic trade deal with China within the same time frame.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThat first step, according to the Trump administration, is meant to lead to a more comprehensive agreement involving more substantial economic reforms than those contained in the proposed initial phase. But Chinese officials are skeptical, saying that would require the U.S. to withdraw tariffs in place on some $360 billion in imports from China -- something many don&rsquo;t see Trump being ready to do.<br />\n<br />\nBloomberg Economics: Truce, Peace, or War? Three 2020 Trade Scenarios<br />\n<br />\nThe people familiar with China&rsquo;s position said the tariffs don&rsquo;t all have to be removed immediately, but they must be part of the next stage. China also wants Trump to cancel a new wave of import taxes due to take effect Dec. 15 on American consumer favorites such as smartphones and toys as part of the phase one deal, the people said.<br />\n<br />\nBeijing is open and willing to continue talks after an initial phase, but both sides recognize that it will be very difficult to reach an agreement on the deep structural reforms the U.S. is pushing for, said one Chinese official familiar with the talks.<br />\n<br />\nChina has stated for months that a final deal must include the removal of all punitive tariffs, and has balked at reforms in areas such as state-run enterprises that could jeopardize the Communist Party&rsquo;s grip on power. It&rsquo;s politically unfeasible for Xi to accept any deal that would keep the punitive tariffs: Nationalists in the party have pressured him through state-run media editorials to avoid signing an &ldquo;unequal treaty&rdquo; reminiscent of those China signed with colonial powers.<br />\n<br />\nTariff Pressure<br />\nSo far, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and his team, which declined to comment, have been adamant that the duties on $250 billion in Chinese goods -- imposed early in the trade war -- be maintained over the long term as a way to enforce any commitments China makes.<br />\n<br />\nThe questions over the future of negotiations reflect a change in U.S. strategy. After ramping up tariffs and pressure on China over the summer and saying he would settle only for an all-encompassing agreement, Trump in early October shifted to the step-by-step approach.<br />\n<br />\n."},{"pid":"c75991ab1442932997e3497ba11d447aef0876f0","tid":1685005,"uid":189404,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-31T11:19:29.000Z","msg":"Terms of Trade: What&rsquo;s In, What&rsquo;s Out of Partial U.S.-China Deal<br />\n<br />\nThe first phase, which negotiators are still trying to nail down, is expected to include a resumption of Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods and other products such as aircraft.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s also expected to include Chinese commitments to protect American intellectual property and an agreement by both sides not to manipulate their currencies. In return, Trump agreed not to go ahead with an Oct. 15 tariff increase and aides have raised the possibility of canceling the Dec. 15 levies.<br />\n<br />\nBut missing from the deal now taking shape are many of the deeper economic reforms such as a changes to the regime of government subsidies Chinese companies benefit from that the Trump administration &ndash; and American businesses &ndash; have been seeking, raising questions over whether the economic cost of Trump&rsquo;s trade assault will have been worth it.<br />\n<br />\nTrump has sought to preempt criticism that he&rsquo;s getting little from China by arguing that the tougher issues will be dealt with in future phases. &ldquo;Phase two will start negotiations almost immediately after we&rsquo;ve concluded phase one,&rdquo; he told reporters this month.<br />\n<br />\nModelling Global GDP Impact of Trade War<br />\nrelates to China Doubts Long-Term Trade Deal Possible With Trump<br />\nSource: Bloomberg Economics, NiGEM<br />\nYet the move to a phased approach reflects China&rsquo;s resistance to many U.S. demands and a concession by the White House to abandon its stance that nothing is agreed until all the thorny issues are resolved.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Even if they do get a phase one, a phase two is going to be substantially more difficult because all the really difficult issues are being deferred,&rdquo; said Eswar Prasad, who once led the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s China team and is now at Cornell University.<br />\n<br />\nDuring recent conversations with senior Chinese policy makers, Prasad said the common theme they expressed was skepticism. &ldquo;They are quite pessimistic,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They fear that any deal that they negotiate with Trump could blow up in their face.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe differences were evident even as Trump announced the &ldquo;substantial phase one deal&rdquo; with China&rsquo;s lead negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, and promised a broader thaw in relations as part of what he dubbed a &ldquo;love-fest.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nBehind closed doors though, the mood was not quite as fulsome.

But a former official says there could still be a long road ahead.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;If the U.S. demands are too much, such as insisting on the so-called structural changes that will alter China&rsquo;s economic model, then the complete deal can&rsquo;t be finished during Trump&rsquo;s first term,&rdquo; said Zhou Xiaoming, a former Ministry of Commerce official. &ldquo;Other than that, China wants to have a deal as quickly as possible&rdquo; though a complete deal would include the removal of all punitive tariffs, he said"},{"pid":"dd94594aa12a7ed33444d01252086f8f0f1da910","tid":1685005,"uid":189404,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-31T11:28:43.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kiss.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"04d10d6ccb8148ac7d5e80bcf8a9993e4aa8bc6e","tid":1685005,"uid":61484,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-31T11:34:29.000Z","msg":"好撚煩<br />\n你做sales 比做客話要又唔要又要又平dd又唔要翻後又想要你都嬲啦心諗想打個客啦<br />\n<br />\n美國快撚d斷交，唔做中國買賣就唔洗煩"},{"pid":"eb3e3f2bb9bb4ea286b4ce7193b1b1479ff6489e","tid":1685005,"uid":68080,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-31T11:46:38.000Z","msg":"認真 侵侵 Art of deal係咪吹大左<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/no.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n而家中共食硬你咁<br />\nphase 1都可以簽下<br />\n<br />\n但係下一步要有deal一定要有移除所有關稅時間表<br />\n另外結構性改革無可能<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/sowhat.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n侵侵吹得太大<img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/mock.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
