We are a city without a majority,' added Ms Weber.<br />\n<br />\nThe report also shows disparities between immigrants and German - with 49 per cent of non-Germans falling below the poverty line, compared to just 23 per cent of original native citizens.  <br />\n<br />\nImmigrants are also less likely to be in work, with just 73 per cent of non-German men and 59 per cent of non-German women being in employment. <br />\n<br />\nThe data shows that 83 per cent of native German men are in work - as are 78 per cent of native German women. <br />\n<br />\nIt comes after a book published last year predicted that native Germans would soon be reduced to a minority in Frankfurst, Augsburg and Stuttgart. <br />\n<br />\nThe German cities would join others throughout Europe that have already seen immigrant numbers overtake natives, including Amsterdam, Brussels, Geneva and London. <br />\n<br />\nThe book, titled Super-Diverstiy: A New Perspective on Integration, criticised politicians' calls for migrants to inegrate. <br />\n<br />\nThe authors criticised politicians' calls for migrants to innegrate, arguing: 'In practice the result of these calls to assimilate is that an increasing number of citizens with a migrant background feels excluded and unwelcome.'<br />\n<br />\nLink:<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4652002/Native-Germans-minority-Germany.html\"
