In 1990 the Cabinet - of which Mr Patten was then a member - restricted the award of British citizenship to 50,000 heads of households under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act.<br />\n<br />\nYesterday Mr Patten denied that the awarding of passports would prompt a flood of immigrants. Speaking on BBC radio, he said: &quot;I don't think the three million, or more than three million, Hong Kong citizens are suddenly going to arrive at Heathrow. Nobody seriously supposes that, and to be blunt if they did they certainly wouldn't be living on a welfare state.&quot; Later, allies of the Governor said he was reflecting the official policy of Government House in Hong Kong, as opposed to that of the British government.<br />\n<br />\nHis intervention was welcomed by Claude Moraes, director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, and by Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats. But it provoked some anger elsewhere.<br />\n<br />\nLord Tebbit, who led the campaign against the admission of Hong Kong Chinese in 1990, said: &quot;Three million Chinese would do this economy a power of good. But the point is whether or not there is to be a further breach of the election undertaking that there should be no further large- scale immigration to Britain.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Chris Patten must have changed his mind as he accepted the Government's view back in 1990. That may be because then he was representing the people of Bath [his former parliamentary constituency], and now he is obviously representing the people of Kowloon.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nDavid Wilshire, MP for Spelthorne, said he was writing to John Major in protest. &quot;It's not acceptable to the British people to let in one more, let alone three million. My response and the response of my constituents is that this country is full up.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nA Foreign Office spokesman said nothing has happened to change the conclusion reached in 1990, and Home Office sources also said no changes were planned.<br />\n<br />\nBut the Chinese government is likely to react to Mr Patten's remarks with fury. It has already denounced the granting of citizenship to 50,000 residents.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk-should-let-in-33-million-from-hong-kong-says-patten-1602582.html?amp\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuk-should-let-in-33-million-from-hong-kong-says-patten-1602582.html%3Famp&d=%2FhX2HLq%2BMhUlGVxEIFXTI%2BPnIAwyWqphGIcg0J4V%2Buw%3D&h=8b890703\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk-should-let-in-33-million-from-hong-kong-says-patten-1602582.html?amp</a>"},{"pid":"c81200c4e13ff06fe0217a8afd61a256a6d8becd","tid":554145,"uid":9348,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T08:28:34.000Z","msg":"肥彭<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c75d9e80348e3d8ebf418c2c7a517ddd64de809f","tid":554145,"uid":63669,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T08:34:54.000Z","msg":"英文就無連登仔睇<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f31d41ba1ae3ea41ea0a2d19d429260c840f3908","tid":554145,"uid":7632,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T08:39:23.000Z","msg":"邊有三百幾萬咁多呀？減去藍屍，已經有其他國家居留權，護照者，我諗一百萬都冇，加上願意放棄特區護照者，得一半倒啦，英國收留假難民同埋歐盟左膠都唔止啦！<br />\n家下舔緊刁縂C眼，R咗訂單，仲理你班遺民咩！"},{"pid":"7b479a4f4382de4c672349d6714905f95c319d22","tid":554145,"uid":48973,"like":0,"dislike":4,"score":-4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T10:04:22.000Z","msg":"佢地要印度咖哩都唔想要港燦"},{"pid":"9786132dfd5daa1ce913037386843e5743520bce","tid":554145,"uid":71008,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T10:07:37.000Z","msg":"So what <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/wonder.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"7a75c06d86f57a8d046796ffb820ddfc17e1acdd","tid":554145,"uid":63669,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"f31d41ba1ae3ea41ea0a2d19d429260c840f3908","tid":554145,"uid":7632,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T08:39:23.000Z","msg":"邊有三百幾萬咁多呀？減去藍屍，已經有其他國家居留權，護照者，我諗一百萬都冇，加上願意放棄特區護照者，得一半倒啦，英國收留假難民同埋歐盟左膠都唔止啦！<br />\n家下舔緊刁縂C眼，R咗訂單，仲理你班遺民咩！"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T11:02:08.000Z","msg":"做你既中國人啦咁多爹<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4fef8f9c11e9b9b9c61901647f7fdc3748c9441e","tid":554145,"uid":40216,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T11:46:25.000Z","msg":"呢3.3m人裡面大概有2m會變成愛國支那人"},{"pid":"7f938b6fccdb1f3dac937e77487c99ab4f1d1212","tid":554145,"uid":7632,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"7a75c06d86f57a8d046796ffb820ddfc17e1acdd","tid":554145,"uid":63669,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"f31d41ba1ae3ea41ea0a2d19d429260c840f3908","tid":554145,"uid":7632,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T08:39:23.000Z","msg":"邊有三百幾萬咁多呀？減去藍屍，已經有其他國家居留權，護照者，我諗一百萬都冇，加上願意放棄特區護照者，得一半倒啦，英國收留假難民同埋歐盟左膠都唔止啦！<br />\n家下舔緊刁縂C眼，R咗訂單，仲理你班遺民咩！"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T11:02:08.000Z","msg":"做你既中國人啦咁多爹<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T11:53:33.000Z","msg":"Dyslexia?"},{"pid":"aac13db2923ee6d4b35326b55907f3d4b34c51b4","tid":554145,"uid":53577,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"7b479a4f4382de4c672349d6714905f95c319d22","tid":554145,"uid":48973,"like":0,"dislike":4,"score":-4,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T10:04:22.000Z","msg":"佢地要印度咖哩都唔想要港燦"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-02-08T12:12:36.000Z","msg":"結果而家英國做咗印巴殖民地，啲鬼仔比阿差恰，女又比蝻強姦。karma."}]}
