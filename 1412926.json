We, as a collective of young filmmakers, hope to once again emphasize the social responsibility of film media.  <br />\n<br />\nIn recent years, local filmmakers face an unprecedented dire socio-political environment, with their filmwork directly suffering as a result.  Films such as &ldquo;TEN YEARS,&rdquo; &ldquo;LOST IN THE FUMES,&rdquo; and &ldquo;VANISHED ARCHIVES,&rdquo; just to name a few &ndash; have been repeatedly censored &ndash; award speeches edited and silenced for broadcast, not to mention the boycott of filmmakers that stand behind their creative work: all blatant evidence the suffocation of freedom in creativity.  <br />\n<br />\nAs filmmakers, filmcritics, and filmlovers, we cannot stand idly by to watch film become twisted into pure economical objects, bureaucratic contraptions, nor do we wish to turn into talking puppets on China&rsquo;s political see-saw.  In this grave situation, we have decided to voice out, and fulfil our social duty as Hong Kong young filmmakers, supporting the Anti Extradition Bill movement, and call for a continuous strike at the August 5th work strike rally.  On this stance, we stand proud on the creative foundation we call home, and call for strength in numbers our fellow crew and colleagues, and for the attention of The People of Hong Kong.  <br />\n<br />\nTo strike for one day is to show solidarity in supporting the Anti Extradition Bill, and the continuous strike will show our determination to the support of the Movement.  If a one-day strike is not enough to upset the regime, then a continuous strike will lead to a city-wide business strike, the most peaceful stance of protest.  &ldquo;They, who stand at the frontlines, who would continuously take bullets and smoke for you, will you continuously strike, to stand and rise with them?&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nOnce again, we reiterate the goal of the continuous strike is for the government to answer to the Five Demands:<br />\n<br />\n1. Withdrawal of the Extradition Bill<br />\n2. Withdrawal of the &ldquo;riot&rdquo; characterization of the 6.12 protest<br />\n3. No further pursuing of all protestors in the movement<br />\n4. Formation of an independent commission of inquiry in police behaviour <br />\n5. Universal suffrage"},{"pid":"e7c101b03d2535408f0186805e2794f0a78ba948","tid":1412926,"uid":263443,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-05T08:20:13.000Z","msg":"We demand the Hong Kong government to answer to the Five Demands by midnight on August 12th, 2019, or the continuous strike will go forth, and add on strike days consecutively: three-day strike on August 12th, five-day strike on August 19th, and so on, until the demands are met.  <br />\n<br />\nOur declaration today is to call for the film industry, the arts and cultural sector to join forces, in joint discussion of the execution of the continuous strike, to set an example for other industries city-wide, to stress importance of the continuous strike. <br />\n<br />\nThe Government Has Forced The People into Revolt, and we have reached the end of the rope.
