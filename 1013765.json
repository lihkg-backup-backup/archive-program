But to facilitate its rollout 300,000 new antennas would be required in the US alone. That&rsquo;s roughly equal to three decades-worth of cell phone tower development.<br />\n<br />\nThe networks require a more dense array of &ldquo;small cell&rdquo; sites because their high frequency waves provide faster speeds but don&rsquo;t travel as far.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/450775-massive-health-experiment-5g-cancer/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rt.com%2Fnews%2F450775-massive-health-experiment-5g-cancer%2F&d=SInmTBH44R2CRaFL2yHJ1CNNnhsiPIcvur842Fp1uB0%3D&h=9ef5278f\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.rt.com/news/450775-massive-health-experiment-5g-cancer/</a><br />\n<br />\n⋯⋯According to the National Toxicology Program&rsquo;s study, commissioned by the FDA in 1999, there is much more evidence of a cancer-cell phone connection than is widely assumed. More shockingly, NTP brass attempted to water down the public health implications of their findings&mdash;in line with the wireless industry&rsquo;s long-standing denial that cell phone users face risks.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;How Big Wireless Made Us Think That Cell Phones Are Safe: A Special Investigation&rdquo; is the April 23, 2018, cover story for The Nation, on stands the week of April 9.
