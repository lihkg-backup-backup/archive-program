I am Andy Chan, speaking from Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nFirst of all, thank you very much for your support. I would like to especially express my gratitude to Mr. Matt Schlapp, the president of ACU, and Mr. Jay Aeba, the president of JCU.<br />\n<br />\nI am safe and fine for now. I am sorry that I couldn&rsquo;t join you in person. I wish I had the chance to get to know you and to talk to you. As you all know, I was detained and arrested for riot when I [was to] depart [for] Japan. I am now released without being charged and on bail. This is the second arrest I have encountered in a month, and I am just one of the thousands who were arrested. Many more Hong Kong citizens will also be arrested very soon, so the situation in Hong Kong is dire.<br />\n<br />\nI am now urging everyone of you to join the revolution. We need you. I will propose three levels of actions, from easiest to more complicated, that you may contribute. To make things clear, it is not just the revolution of Hong Kong people but the revolution of the free world, the revolution of our time. We are now in the 21st century, the year of 2019. It is ridiculous to me that there is still such a massive communist country in the world. What was not finished by our predecessors now falls upon our shoulders. It is time for us to end communism. It is time for all of us to join the revolution. When dictatorship is a fact, revolution becomes a duty.<br />\n<br />\nThe first action that you may take part in is to acknowledge China as Chinazi. We Hong Kong people want the world to know that the Chinese regime is a Nazi regime. We want that to be circulated on media, on the internet all over the world.<br />\n<br />\nSecondly, a humanitarian crisis is happening in Hong Kong. There was another terror attack committed by the Hong Kong police yesterday. They attacked innocent citizens randomly with batons, pepper spray, and even iron bars in a train compartment and metro station. Hundreds of people were hurt, but they could not simply go to the hospital. Otherwise, they will be arrested by the police at the hospital. Our medical team has been overloaded and will collapse soon. Therefore, we need medical support. We need INGOs to step in.  <br />\n<br />\nThirdly, please bring full-scale of sanction on to Hong Kong. The sanctions brought on China must [be] brought on Hong Kong because China can escape sanctions through Hong Kong. I would like to take the chance to reiterate my advocacy again: to revoke the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act passed by the United States Congress. It allows Hong Kong to enjoy a special status apart from China. However, it turns out to be a back door of the free world that could be accessed and manipulated by China. Moreover, over 70% of foreign direct investment goes in to China through Hong Kong. Hong Kong is the main window that China obtains U.S. dollars from. Therefore, shut it down.<br />\n<br />\nWe Hong Kong people are ready for and welcome all kinds of sanctions. Out of the many sanctions, we are desperately wanting two of them. First, stop selling equipment to Hong Kong police. Second, restrict the entrance of Hong Kong police into your country. There are already PLA and paramilitary police undercover in the police force.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong is already burning, we need China to burn with us. Freedom is not free. There is always a cost for freedom and dignity. It is our glory to burn with China. Give us liberty or death. Please bring sanctions on to Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\n原link: <a href=\"http://japan-forward.com/arrested-hong-kong-leader-andy-chan-burn-china-with-us/?fbclid=IwAR0YLX3iLSI8Qr4O1ndhBrKYd4VnLXm9yJ3ijcmLjwOT1GQ3aQO1SLJA6FA \" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fjapan-forward.com%2Farrested-hong-kong-leader-andy-chan-burn-china-with-us%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0YLX3iLSI8Qr4O1ndhBrKYd4VnLXm9yJ3ijcmLjwOT1GQ3aQO1SLJA6FA%20&d=aWTYmjKPTw65bzRUwiqYJNT2hWdA4JmoO%2FtHFZtOkv0%3D&h=47d52fc9\" target=\"_blank\">http://japan-forward.com/arrested-hong-kong-leader-andy-chan-burn-china-with-us/?fbclid=IwAR0YLX3iLSI8Qr4O1ndhBrKYd4VnLXm9yJ3ijcmLjwOT1GQ3aQO1SLJA6FA </a><br />\n<br />\n--------<br />\n推爆俾外媒!!!!!
