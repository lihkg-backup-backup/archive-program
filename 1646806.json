Anyhow, I don't think he can get the nomination easily as he has some strong opponents within the democrat camp.<br />\n<br />\nPpl can support Trump here but even the republicans may not want him to be re-elected (agreed Rubio and Cruz would be better choices). Democrats are not the devils many ppl here portrayed them to be (it's weird when people seems to associate left in US with China's communism? which is totally baseless and irrelevant).<br />\n<br />\nAgreed with D.West that we have to get out of US internal politics and unite as many Americans behind our cause as possible. We want US support no matter who is the next president."}]}
