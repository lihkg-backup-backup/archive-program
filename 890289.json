Newton <br />\n@MichaelENewton1<br />\n6h6 hours ago<br />\n#Earlyvoting update:<br />\n<strong>The #Republican share of votes cast so far is +1.0% vs 2016. In contrast, the #Democrat share is -0.1%.</strong><strong> In total, the Rep-Dem margin vs 2016 is R+1.10%</strong>. So the GOP is doing ~184k early votes better in these 13 states than they did in 2016.<br />\n<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DrM54fyV4AAn7j-.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FDrM54fyV4AAn7j-.jpg&h=4aef455f&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>#Republicans have lifted their share of the vote from 2016 in 9 of the 13 states. #Democrats have done so in just 7 of the 13.</strong> Net, the distribution of votes have moved in the #GOP&rsquo;s favor in 8 states; to the #Dems in 5.<br />\n<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DrM560kUcAAQne6.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FDrM560kUcAAQne6.jpg&h=90df8570&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe votes continue to roll in from Florida and they continue to favor the Democrats, as expected. As a result, the GOP-Dem margin decreased 0.10% since this afternoon and 0.42% over the last 24 hours.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The trend toward Dems continues. At R+1.10% with a few days left and ~89% of early votes already cast, it looks like #earlyvoting may finish about R+1.0% as compared to 2016.</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe #GOP ending #earlyvoting ~1.0% better than they did in 2016 would be remarkable. 2016 was a great year for #Republicans, winning 241 House seats &amp; Presidency. <strong>There is no sign of the supposed #bluewave and perhaps a small #redwave might be coming.</strong><br />\n<br />\nAbout 16.7 million people have already cast their ballots in #earlyvoting in just these 13 states alone. This represents about 45% of the projected numbers of votes to be cast in these states and about 15% of the total projected to be cast this election. <br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Interestingly, states with competitive races (AZ, FL, NV, WV) are among those seeing the largest GOP gains. Those with the biggest Dem gains (CO, IA, LA, ME, NC) have fewer or no competitive statewide races.<br />\n</span></strong><br />\n<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DrM6HOdU8AYv5Rv.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FDrM6HOdU8AYv5Rv.jpg&h=20a9fceb&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelENewton1/status/1059254319281668096\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FMichaelENewton1%2Fstatus%2F1059254319281668096&d=vbmn2%2BGBdo%2FsqVLC3OULde9M5Ue6CDmcYDZznX2R1Ws%3D&h=8b75e468\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FMichaelENewton1%2Fstatus%2F1059254319281668096&h=6185458f\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/MichaelENewton1/status/1059254319281668096</a>"},{"pid":"cea5d5cd7729a54f3885547880aa11949866a26d","tid":890289,"uid":45213,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:07:10.000Z","msg":"咩係early voting?"},{"pid":"133832368debbabe6b5682b33a0047f1e1e893f9","tid":890289,"uid":65984,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:09:39.000Z","msg":"近年選舉咁多黑天鵝, 我反而想前期民以偏向對家<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/flowerface.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"122a6d17cbcfdbb97cfb0dd592bc2d9b91e6bdc1","tid":890289,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"cea5d5cd7729a54f3885547880aa11949866a26d","tid":890289,"uid":45213,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:07:10.000Z","msg":"咩係early voting?"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:09:44.000Z","msg":"提早投票<br />\n唔係民調鳩噏"},{"pid":"aee816f834b21581c7d0b8aed97cf0cbf5a31125","tid":890289,"uid":41245,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"133832368debbabe6b5682b33a0047f1e1e893f9","tid":890289,"uid":65984,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:09:39.000Z","msg":"近年選舉咁多黑天鵝, 我反而想前期民以偏向對家<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/flowerface.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:17:40.000Z","msg":"當所有都係黑天鵝<br />\n噉會唔會反省下係咪民調出事呢<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"9b746828dac723cb9a33797a430d18bb87ef9d95","tid":890289,"uid":28765,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:21:03.000Z","msg":"幾時投"},{"pid":"881addc7382fdb22c341f8a6a61d1eadee7aa2b9","tid":890289,"uid":48083,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"9b746828dac723cb9a33797a430d18bb87ef9d95","tid":890289,"uid":28765,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:21:03.000Z","msg":"幾時投"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:24:42.000Z","msg":"聽日"},{"pid":"9cae9b6781bc16e5f2d9a9d7ec5be850eab0371d","tid":890289,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"122a6d17cbcfdbb97cfb0dd592bc2d9b91e6bdc1","tid":890289,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"cea5d5cd7729a54f3885547880aa11949866a26d","tid":890289,"uid":45213,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:07:10.000Z","msg":"咩係early voting?"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:09:44.000Z","msg":"提早投票<br />\n唔係民調鳩噏"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-11-05T08:35:35.000Z","msg":"民調理論上問到個early voter如果佢答翻佢投個個，咁其實民調都包括個early vote <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
