And all governments should blame for such actions. <br />\n<br />\nChinese people always think the world needs to take the benefit from China market. But imaging that if no counties sell products to China. It is the time for the Chinese people starting to beg for.<br />\n<br />\nBe careful of the easy money from China, you will find out the evil inside it like what&rsquo;s happening in HK. And now it is starting happen in the rest of the world.<br />\n<br />\nE.g. When some reps of the organisation saying something about supporting the freedom of Hong Kong. It must be resulting from the attack by Chinese people or even Chinese gov.

The CCP and PRC are trying to spread extremism and even totalitarianism INTERNATIONALLY. It&rsquo;s certainly harming the CORE VALUES of the civilised society&mdash;harming the freedom of expressing one&rsquo;s own views. Celebrities, and even just AN ORDINARY CITIZEN, are forced to &ldquo;shut up&rdquo; under the pressure given by the CCP. Some may also lose their jobs due to their political stance.<br />\n<br />\nCan you guys imagine how terrible it is? It&rsquo;s what white/red terror is.
