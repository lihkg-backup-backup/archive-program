Healthcare manager must be stop the rumor and suggest the right way to prevent the influenza.<br />\n<br />\n3.\tImprove the medical system. <br />\nThe medical system isn&rsquo;t enough. Infectious disease is a rapidly spreading disease.

For example, when the SARS occur, we haven&rsquo;t have a building that is for cope with infectious diseases. We just use the Amoy Gardens to isolation the patient.

You never know when the influence occurs but you can prevent and decrease the chance of suffering. Healthcare managers must require the people who are the highest risks infect influenza receive the vaccine. Such as healthcare worker, they always have a contact with the patient. Although the vaccine cannot 100% prevent the healthcare worker. But it can help them prevent a few type of influence. Also, it is fewer side effects and safety. Sometimes, the health care worker will be lazy. They will think &ldquo;I have received many vaccines.

They can require the worker wear the facemask. What is facemask? Facemask is a disposable mask that covers our nose and mouth. It can prevent bacteria spread.
