We are deeply saddened and bitterly regret that the state of turmoil and spiraling violence has spread to university campuses.<br />\n <br />\nIt is particularly worrying that our campus has been turned into a scene of disorder and that activists from outside have gone onto the campus in the last several days. Not only have many facilities on the campus been severely and extensively vandalised, the activities inside the campus also pose immediate safety risks to our students and staff who are on the campus. We urgently advise our students and staff to stay away from the campus. The University also strongly condemns the occupation of the campus by the people who commit these acts of violence and demands them to leave immediately.<br />\n <br />\nThe safety of our students and staff is always the University&rsquo;s top priority. For this reason, we have decided to substitute all face-to-face teaching with on-line teaching for the rest of this semester. We are working with the academic staff to make use of all feasible on-line means to ensure teaching can continue during this period. We will do our utmost to safeguard our students&rsquo; right to learning.<br />\n <br />\nWe once again call on all parties to remain calm and restrained. In a civilised society, violence can&rsquo;t help to solve any problem but will only intensify the tensions and cause greater damages. We plead to the members of PolyU to stand together in this difficult time. With our concerted efforts, we sincerely hope that the social impasse and turbulence will come to an end, and our society will return to peace and tranquility soon.<br />\n <br />\nBest regards <br />\n <br />\nProfessor Jin-Guang TENG, President<br />\n<br />\n講黎講去都係三篤屁<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c7ebc6e5809f735cfdd36677dd6520ba50f49eac","tid":1723346,"uid":243761,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-15T07:15:49.000Z","msg":"*省略咗下面既署名"},{"pid":"bc02035b61eae7ce8f2615d32934a11a26277f96","tid":1723346,"uid":258598,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-15T07:15:52.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"73e9818e722751f9d65691e4bc6b19ccd085b216","tid":1723346,"uid":37680,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-15T07:17:10.000Z","msg":"原來poly有校長"},{"pid":"8f2d2df916ca36434536169dce0e2b4113d38593","tid":1723346,"uid":299742,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-15T07:20:08.000Z","msg":"似係政府逼緊所有大學校長出信屌學生喎<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/donno.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"20280b7caa8e7dd23533804950344e5a2cac1e78","tid":1723346,"uid":243761,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"8f2d2df916ca36434536169dce0e2b4113d38593","tid":1723346,"uid":299742,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-11-15T07:20:08.000Z","msg":"似係政府逼緊所有大學校長出信屌學生喎<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/donno.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-15T07:21:53.000Z","msg":"真呀<br />\nCity琴日出 仲報埋驚<br />\nCu今日都有出"},{"pid":"2ac54b9a734c2cde8cd3ee975ec524f2dd4a755a","tid":1723346,"uid":185238,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-11-15T07:30:48.000Z","msg":"埋大人睇完都完全唔覺得關自己事<br />\n<br />\nwfc about ur words, who do u think u are"}]}
