How are you going to arrange transport? 🚅🚈🚂🚆🚇It&rsquo;s a fair bet that the Japanese yen 💴 will continue falling so you might as well go on a trip to Tokyo and Fuji mountain 🏔 for your holiday. The sun has been dazzlingly bright all week so you might just as well go for an outdoor onsen soaking up the sun 🌞I recommend climbing 🧗🏻&zwj;♀️the Fuji mountain ⛰It&rsquo;s an arduous journey but it&rsquo;s well worth it for the view from the top and the confidence that you&rsquo;ll gain afterwards. Several years ago I saw X Japan live at the Tokyo Dome Stadium 🏟 which was absolutely incredible and unforgettable. They&rsquo;ve been strutting their stuff since they were young. Even though their prime have passed they&rsquo;re still incredible musicians so don&rsquo;t sell them short ! Right now, I work at Hotel JAP Tokyo🏨My friend Alex has accepted a commission for a sculpture from the hotel 🏨 about which I&rsquo;m very pleased. I congratulated him on having been commissioned to make a sculpture for the hotel. It&rsquo;s a once in a lifetime opportunity. Another friend of mine who worked for the hotel was assigned to the Hokkaido office with which she&rsquo;s pleased. I congratulated her for getting the promotion. Again, holidaying in japan 🇯🇵 over the summer is a good bet since the yen 💴 has dropped fairly rapidly over the last four and a half months. If you&rsquo;re staying at the aforementioned hotel 🏨 please remember the following as I work there😊: First of all, before washing your clothes please remove coins and tissue from the pockets and put only seventy percent of the dirty clothes 👔in the wash tub. This will ensure your clothes to get evenly clean and the washing machine will less likely be out of order. Please towel off the drum after each use so as not to cause mould or mildew to grow in the drum. Second of all, please don&rsquo;t turn the air conditioner up to more than twenty five degrees Celsius. Otherwise it won&rsquo;t blow cold air and will smell bad. Third, after cleaning 🧼 the tables and toilet 🚽 please rinse a cloth with clean water 💦 and wipe them again so as not to cause discoloration. Lastly, please don&rsquo;t stick or nail anything to the wall as the paint will peel. <br />\n<br />\nEnjoy your time in Tokyo and around Fuji mountain ! 🤗"},{"pid":"830f7bdcbd07c70768800d13b6b5919b7968bace","tid":1298245,"uid":38631,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"b3e112894472bf4afbd96d053c704f1076c1454e","tid":1298245,"uid":150807,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-09T04:11:22.000Z","msg":"森哥加油<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-09T10:16:47.000Z","msg":"thanks<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"93c4852b2ac90264939649013b21300fa82528b8","tid":1298245,"uid":41484,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"4700341d19cddaceb62449003b61225c84a53247","tid":1298245,"uid":38631,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"211324ea5c9b6520a0cdcb0f94ccacbfd47b36ae","tid":1298245,"uid":41484,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-08T23:25:57.000Z","msg":"行富士宮線啦"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-07-08T23:27:39.000Z","msg":"我太新手、怕行唔到"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-07-09T14:34:04.000Z","msg":"上年我成功行左<br />\n我本身唔算係成日行山，唔多做運動的人<br />\n其實慢慢行，夠安全裝備，小心啲唔大問題"}]}
