Following a fantastic second half of 2014/15, the 2015/16 season culminated in only narrowly missing out on winning the FA cup as well as securing our Premier League place for a record breaking fourth time. During his tenure Alan&rsquo;s hard work and dedication were without question, he has improved so many areas of the Club and we wish him the very best for the future.&quot;<br />\n <br />\nWith games now coming thick and fast over the holiday period the Club are hoping to put someone in place as quickly as possible but have nothing to say about a replacement at this time.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
