Although we do not wear uniform and are not required to swear an oath, we are obliged to follow guidelines and regulations strictly when we perform our duties in order to maintain a safe and efficient flow of air traffic.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nTo work in a profession where life and death matters, either stress or being blamed by others is not an excuse of making mistakes or negligence. A minor miscalculation could easily result in a disaster. We owe a social responsibility to every passenger, flight crew and ground crew in the same way the government and Police Force owe every Hong Kong people. Regrettably, six citizens of this city chose to end their lives to accuse the administrative mistakes committed by the government while the later still pay no attention to the tragedy till this day.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nAs aviation professionals, we strive to discharge our duties without complaints despite the injustice acts that had happened in this city. On the other hand, as Hong Kong citizens, we are deeply saddened by the tear gas canisters, bean bag rounds and rubber bullets that were fired by the Police as well as the violence acts committed by armed mobs. As we hear the people cry and witness the city descends into chaos, we feel that it is not right to continue to perform our duties silently as if nothing has happened and let the abusers get away with their evil deeds.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nToday, we not only focus on professionalism; we turn to our conscience.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWe feel furious on the pointless, nonconstructive and sometimes misleading comments given by senior government officials and Hong Kong Police Force. We have no choice but to stand up and join our fellow colleagues in the aviation community in the airport protest on 26 July. Meanwhile, we urge the government to provide positive response to the five demands* by the people. If no such response is given, we do not rule out the possibility of taking further actions such as uncooperative movement.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe airport is the world's busiest cargo gateway and one of the world's busiest passenger airports. There will be huge economic loss if the operation of the airport is inefficiently hindered. Yet, if we turn to our conscience, we know that the safety of Hong Kong people should always be on the top of the economy. We will do what should be done.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWe are professional air traffic controllers; we are conscientious air traffic controllers.<br />\n<br />\n#WearBlack<br />\n<br />\nFive Demands<br />\n1. Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill<br />\n2. Retraction of the &ldquo;riot&rdquo; characterisation of 12 June protest<br />\n3. Release and exoneration of arrested protesters<br />\n4. Formation of independent commission of inquiry<br />\n5.
