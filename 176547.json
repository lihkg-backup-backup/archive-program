The government has launched a campaign called Second Chance to encourage employers to recruit reformed criminals or drug addicts.  Write a letter to all Hong Kong businesses outlining the new project, explaining the benefits and persuading them to join the scheme.<br />\n<br />\nDear Sir/Madam,<br />\n<br />\nSecond Chance &ndash; An opportunity for people to live again <br />\n<br />\nOn behalf of Hong Kong Correctional Service (HKCS), I am writing to cordially invite your business to participate in Second Chance, a campaign launched recently to help ex-offenders to return to society. The success of the campaign lies in your staunch support so I sincerely hope that you would take a few minutes to learn more details of the campaign, which your company will find joining it meaningful and mutually beneficial. <br />\n<br />\nSecond Chance, initiated by HKCS and joined by hundreds of multinational and local companies, aims at promoting an inclusive society for reformed criminals and drug addicts and helping them to adapt life after returning to society. Job searching, among other things, is the most integral yet difficult part for them to be included in society again. With a view to facilitating their job searching, HKCS, through the Second Chance campaign, sets up a job-matching coordination centre linking suitable ex-offender candidates and companies who are open to recruit them, arranges interviews and on-the-job trainings, and ensures satisfying working performances subsequently if they are employed through the campaign. Participating companies, in addition to one-stop recruitment assistance, will also enjoy other benefits such as tax cuts and continuing subsidies.   <br />\n<br />\nRunning only for several months, the campaign is well-received by society and employers. Most participating companies agree that re-formed recruitees show a strong determination to turn over a new leaf, which makes them willing to take any tasks assigned to them. The positive and active attitude of the re-formed employees not only makes them a trustworthy workforce, it also spurs a similar work ethic among other colleagues, which is conductive in increasing productivity. As such, other than the financial benefits giving to participants, your company can also build a more dedicated workforce by recruiting our re-formed ex-offenders.<br />\n<br />\nTo ensure positive working performances of the employees and to protect your company&rsquo;s interest, all prospective recruitees will be employed under a three-month probation period. Our officers will also make frequent visits to your company to discuss the performances of our ex-offenders, and follow up any problems occurred during the probation. If you think there is room for improvement for our ex-offenders during the employment, our officers will also be happy to discuss and provide solutions to you to help the recruitee to better his/her work.<br />\n<br />\nAs with other people who have made mistakes, those ex-offenders have made mistakes too. But everyone deserves a second chance if he/she is reformed. If you share this value common value and would like to offer your help to those ex-offenders, please fill in the attached form or simply telephone our Mr. Chan Tai-man at 1234 5678 to give a positive response!<br />\n<br />\nYours faithfully,<br />\nChan Tai Man <br />\nFor Hong Kong Correctional Service"},{"pid":"b51018263199755d8098dbaa3a7667c8a2419b86","tid":176547,"uid":83941,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-28T08:58:11.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"d490213b7dd8279015c590b43e401eb5a188fc0e","tid":176547,"uid":23785,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-28T08:59:29.000Z","msg":"B"},{"pid":"01b6b7b65f0693684a58b70f0d6e109dcaa19a0e","tid":176547,"uid":73026,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-28T08:59:50.000Z","msg":"A-"},{"pid":"8bccad36d533d96fc1137b19b4b8638789317fa3","tid":176547,"uid":48083,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2017-03-28T09:10:53.000Z","msg":"寫得幾好<br />\n<br />\n吹毛求疵啲講, 個人覺得:<br />\n<br />\n1. 第二段用多啲Second Chance做主語較好<br />\n<br />\nSecond Chance was initiated......; it aims.......
