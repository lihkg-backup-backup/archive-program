They're sharing the preparation between them so it isn't too much work. Happy birthday Carter. I'm sure your friends and fans will join me in wishing you a very happy birthday. Last year he got a massage chair for my birthday. I remember I said &quot;I can't believe you got me a massage chair&quot; It didn't come cheap. Tracy McGrady has received a commission for an article on picasso from an art magazine. He's doing research in preparation for the article. His wife is assisting in the preparation of the research. Raptors versus Bulls is gonna take place next month. Matches like this need adequate preparation. The poster and the promo video are in preparation. The players in  Raptors are doing thorough preparation for it as they didn't perform well in their last game because they did very little preparation. The players in Bulls didn't seem to have done much preparation for their last game too. They almost lost it so this time they are doing meticulous preparation for it including three point shooting, stealing and dunking as well as cardiovascular training. Training six hours a day is good preparation for a playoff games. You cannot beat a high level team without proper preparation. My friend Joe is making preparations for his ski trip to Hokkaido. He's also making preparations to meet his favourite band X Japan in Osaka. So he's preoccupied with these preparations. Preparations are being made for next week's ski festival in osaka.

It was a long journey and I was grateful for his company. On the day we set off I was waiting for mark on the corner outside Times Square. He lives just round the corner so it only took him ten minute to come. Meanwhile a pedestrian came up and asked if there was any medical centre nearby because he had been suffering from heatstroke. I told him that there were a pharmacy and a clinic just around the corner. As summer was around the corner people suffered from heatstroke more easily. However there're many ways to prevent heatstroke during hot weather. At home sitting on a sofa or in a recliner or an armchair does wonders for your body. Moreover eating a balanced diet of veggies and fruits and a little meat can work wonders for your health. Lastly exercise and meditation do wonders for mind and body. We've come to stay in Carter's mansion in Kyoto for a few nights. On the second day we were watching television in the living room whereas Mark was cooking in the kitchen. His elder brother had just popped upstairs to get a book. His younger brother had popped into the bank to get some cash while his sister had popped to a music store to get some trombone scores..As mark entered the living room I jumped out from behind the wall and cried &quot;boo!&quot; It was absolutely hilarious as I was finally able to frighten him successfully. Dave would pop in and see is later. His girlfriend would pop over and visited us a day later too. They're good company. Dave said he deserved a promotion but instead his colleague was given a promotion because his boss is biased towards his colleague. I said that's the way the cookie crumbles. It's water under the bridge. What's done is done. Mark also said it's no use crying over spilt milk. Whats done cannot be undone. Let bygones be bygones. Apparently his manager is also biased against him and in favor of his colleague. Oh well. He told me not to mention it when we're in company. By all means. Next Tuesday I'll pop over to Dave's place to play his cornet. I prefer the company of musicians. Before he popped over he was browsing in Zara. In the meantime I went for a browse around a bookshop and popped to the bank to open an account. The residential estate Mark lives in in kyoto consists of houses rather than apartments. Each house has at least one retractable awning or canopy. The canopy could be made of cloth, glass, stainless steel, steel or concrete. In his front garden he planted a lychee tree, two mango trees, a chestnut oak, a black maple, a red maple and bushes in the lawn. Some of the bushes produce lovely piccolo-shaped flowers in the lawn. He also grew flowers such as roses, orchids, lavender, hydrangeas, sunflowers and violets, all of which are in full bloom. There're some exquisite flowerpots placed near the lawn as decoration. He knows the grass every now and then. He manicures the garden from time to time. His back garden is enormous which is five thousand  square foot in size. It used to be a lawn but mark turned ot into a meadow blanketed in wild flowers and exotic flowers. Some of the flower buds haven't opened yet but as the weather gets warmer thr flowers open. Even inside mark's house he has a vase of hydrangeas and a few plotted plants. Orchids can be cultivated in vases or flower pots. In summer the meadow is covered in beautiful summer flowers. In the spring the meadow is a mass of pretty spring flowers. In the fall the meadow is blanketed with lovely fall flowers. In winter pretty winter flowers bloom in the meadow. It's an extraordinary garden. Every valentine day Mark buys a bouquet of red roses and hydrangea for his girlfriend. They're pretty cut flowers. His new table is covered by protective plastic wrappings. His new sixty-five-inch television is also covered with plastic sheeting. About seventy one percent of the earth's surface is covered by water."},{"pid":"a643b2c08764da2b478530cb308e78a005ce9f4a","tid":1798276,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-01T11:59:30.000Z","msg":"On the morning of the second day in Vince Carter's mansion, his next-door neighbour's canopy was leaking all over the floor in his garden due to heavy rain. The water pipe attached to their stainless steel canopy was also dripping water down the wall onto his floor so Mark asked if he could he could enter their garden and wipe their water pipe and the edge of the canopy and mop them so as to stop water from leaking out of them. I too entered their garden and helped mop their water pipe and the edge of the canopy so as to stop water from leaking from them. There was a leak in their canopy so they had a bucket underneath for the water to drop into but the bucket was overflowing all over the floor. So we placed another bucket beside it but very soon water began to overflow from the bucket which caused flooding. I tried to soak up the water with towels but it was impossible. Water soaked into my shoes. Rain soaked through Mark's shoes and clothes as well. Some of his neighbors said they had a leak inside their house as well due to heavy rainfall. About four and a half hours later Dave called and said he finally got a promotion. The opportunity that he had waited for so long has finally come along. Opportunities like this don't always come along. After he left Zara his friend came along in his Lamborghini and offered him a lift to a restaurant to celebrate with him. I enjoy strolling hand in hand with my girlfriend along the nearby beach. In fact I went fir a leisurely stroll there earlier. With only my thoughts for company I lay on the beach reading a book which felt thoroughly enjoyable. On that evening Dave finally arrived. I didn't know he had company.

He said some tree branches and twigs tumbled down during the hurricane so he had to give his garden a thorough cleanup. Some tree trunks in the nearby park toppled over as a result of the hurricane.

Dream cruise is out of commission by broken components and power failures and won't be in commission until August. Costa cruise which is also out of commission for repairs is expected to be back in commission in September. Oh well. Yesterday a double-decker bus which has passengers in it was stuck in Lyndhurst Terrace along with the cars behind it because a truck was parked in the middle of the road delivering orchids to the florist's but the truck driver had disappeared. Nobody knew where he had gone. The double-deck bus and the cats behind it was blowing their horns along the way which was hilarious. After twenty minutes the lorry driver finally returned and the traffic was flowing again. Originally my girlfriend and I ate supper at an Italian restaurant but we realised we didn't like the menu. As we were leaving the restaurant a waitress came up to us so I said &quot;Thank you but we've changed our minds&quot; A stout man and a svelte woman also found out they didn't like the menu so the man said &quot;Thank you. We're in the mood for a different cuisine tonight. We'll be back another time. Thank you for your hospitality.&quot; By the way I'm held up in a traffic jam on Queens road central. Yesterday there was heavy traffic here. The day before yesterday the traffic was unusually light. After midnight that day, there was no traffic. In Ice road, there's light traffic today. Yesterday there wasn't much traffic. The day before yesterday there was no traffic at all. It's unpredictable. Anyway I'll leave home early next time hoping to miss the traffic. This afternoon I was in the mood to dine out. I said to my cousin &quot;we could go out to eat if you're in the mood&quot; He said &quot;I'm not really in the mood to lunch out&quot; So at the end I cooked food for myself. I'm in the mood to go swimming but my cousin's husband isn't in the mood for a swim so I will go swimming myself. By the way Joyce is in a mood. She's in a bad mood so I'm ignoring her. She said she was in no mood for shopping. According to her friends she's in one of her moods so they're staying out of her way as well. Her sister said &quot;I'd better keep out of her way&quot; My friend Joe thinks that if a woman without makeup still looks pretty then she's pretty. Not every man's type of girls is the same. Of course everyone likes handsome and beayrigyo people. In terms of appearance some guys like svelte girls, some like sporty girls, some like petite girls, some like them tall and thin, some like them well-rounded and curvaceous, some like them voluptuous, some like full bust, some like wide hips, some like shapely legs, some like silky feet, and so on. In terms of character, some guys like vivacious girls, some like kind-hearted and helpful girls, some like them compassionate, some like them tactful and diplomatic, some like them quiet, some like them sociable and talkative, some like to be dominated and controlled and so forth. Joe is a fan of Tracy Zhu and Samantha Gao, both of whom are exquisitely beautiful women. Like him they both have an exquisite taste in fashion, food, clothes, shoes, interior and exterior design. Both are glamorous ladies who always dress up in glamorous outfits. They rarely dress down. I once saw Samantha dress up in eighties clothing for a party whereas tracy was in a bikini for it. Both of them have a glamorous job and career. I regard acting as a worthwhile career. Tracy has got a leading role in the upcoming television series while samantha has got s supporting role in it. She plays the role of a doctor in it."},{"pid":"1c3f67d733ca34705f8da679877f100e78763f15","tid":1798276,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-03T05:33:56.000Z","msg":"Las tuesday, Vince Carter's brother Mark asked if I would like to have lunch at his place. I replied in the affirmative. I had some snacks beforehand to take the edge of my hunger. We washed two boxes of egg salad and left the salad to dry out before eating it. In this way the egg salad contains more nutrients than when you consume it right after opening the box. We cut the meat into dice, peeled and diced the potatoes and chopped the onions. We were careful because the knife has a razor-sharp edge. The inside of the meat is raw while the outside is cooked. Onions can be eaten raw or cooked. After lunch I said &quot;I'll wash you dry&quot; He came to the kitchen and stood beside me drying up the cutlery and utensils while I washed. Since it's best to dry your clothes out the night before by hanging them on the clothes line  I went ahead and helped him do that. We then joined his sister on a run along the promenade which felt relaxing. I bought her a pair of sneakers who said she would pay me back if I got her those trainers. Looks like she sold me a pup- and then I bought a Chanel watchband but I'm wondering if this really is authentic. I might have been sold a bill of goods. I gave her a foot massage and dried her feet on her brother's quilt lol and a towel. On that evening we joined with their parents in doing a five hundred five thousand piece jigsaw puzzle. It felt thoroughly enjoyable. Since both mark and I are Marvel fans, the next day we went to the cinema and joined the queue for the movie tickets for Avengers. His friends joined is later. Mark is a marketing manager at hilton. I enjoy his company. He uses photoshop every day for poster and banner design as photoshop is worth its weight in gold digital marketing. The party poster he designed is fabulous. The gold words are clearly defined on the black background. I admire his ambition and dogged determination to succeed. He never gets sidetracked by unimportant issues. In addition he enjoys participating in debates. Just the other day he wiped the floor with all opposition during a debate about the existence of god which felt pretty impressive. His best friend is his pug. He towels the dog off after its bath. Today dogs certainly don't come cheap including getting them spayed or neutered and any medications they take when they have a condition. Mark's elder sister is an estate agent who earns a basic salary of nine thousand nine hundred dollars per month plus a four percent commission on every deal she makes so she doesn't work by commission only. Last year her sales fell short of the expectations of the company partly because the economy was hardly blooming. She's s fan of Jacqueline wong. Have you heard of the sex scandal involving her and andy hui? She was having an affair with Andy who's married to Sammi. No doubt they were an item. As a result many people think it's time for her to hang up her spurs. In fact her friend alan hung up his spurs several years ago because of a sex scandal. His brother-in-law is an iPhone salesman who gets an hourly wage of seventy nine dollars plus a thirteen percent commission on the sales he makes so his job isn't on commission only. So far his profits has fulfilled his expectation. He said he would be out on strike but it turned out that he was joking because his dad is a true patriot. If he had been on strike his dad wouldn't have been happy. Mark's dad is a physics professor who is currently solving an exceedingly difficult math question for all he is worth. Hopefully he'll find an answer to it soon. Besides physics he's an avid football fan. His favourite team Barcelona is currently top of the league while budapest is bottom of the league. Milan is lying fourth in the league this year. Recently Madrid edged Rome five-four. Madrid edged its rival, rome to the second place. The league championship is the opportunity for the best teams in the league to strut their stuff."},{"pid":"14758a23bff1d2d246935559a652a1566d394e3b","tid":1798276,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-03T06:03:21.000Z","msg":"Vince Carter's younger sister is a concierge who feels she's chosen the wrong career choice.

She blames her bad career decision on mark. I then said &quot;Let's just wipe the slate clean. It's over.&quot; She blames him for convincing her to be a concierge. Well that's the way the cookie crumbles. His auntie is a professional footballer. She's so focused during a match that she never goes off on a sidetrack. His brother has opened a beauty parlour. Hopefully it attracts lots of customers since he bet the ranch on it. His uncle was broke several years ago because he bet the farm on his company which went bankrupt later. He managed to honour his debts in three years. His cousin is planning on doing a phd since these days a master's degree isn't worth the paper it's printed on, let alone a bachelor degree. Last Tuesday his cousin dropped a dumbbell and put a dent in my chair. I said I would wipe his slate clean if he fixed the dent in my chair. Yesterday he was almost swindled out of thousands of dollars. I told him that person was a scammer who was trying to swindle money from him. The contract isn't worth the paper it's written on. Fortunately he listened to me. Otherwise the swindler wiulsve swindled him out of thousands of dollars. I've read in the newspapers that some customers were promised to get a refund of they weren't satisfied with the products but later they found out that they were sold down the river because they have been unable to contact the swindler to date. The scammer didn't honour the contracts. I remember a decade ago there was a protest where the protestors clashed with the police in osaka. I saw it on NHK then. I thought the police weren't tough enough. All the riot police were holding a truncheon in one hand and a shield in the other hand. In this way you cabtvreally fight thr protestors and arrest them since you have no free hands to get hold of them. That's why it took four policemen to catch ahold of one protestor. From a fighting viewpoint some of the riot police should be holding just a nightstick, some just a shield, the other both.  And all of them should be trained on hoe they fight when they're holding just a shield, holding just a baton and holding both. It was total chaos. I didn't think that osama had ever been so disastrous before. The police who I wholeheartedly supported only used tear smoke in an attempt to drive them away which was clearly not enough. The police shouldn't have been afraid of being criticized for using excessive force because it was utterly not the case. Firing rubber bullets and bean bags at the demonstrators was necessary, lawful and appropriate. Those who sabotaged the nearby buildings and the railings should've been thrown in prison. The train network was partially paralyzed for many weeks. The world had brought the city to the edge of a catastrophe. The united states had already imposed trade sanctions against Japan at that time. The US president said he would take punitive action if the police there used excessive force. Japan was afraid that America would toughen punitive import tariffs still further on clothes, agricultural products, food and alcohol and worse still they eiukd convince other nations to impose international economic sanctions on the country. Of course the downside was the products in America which they'd imposed punitive import duties on would rise still higher. The economic sanctions on Japan wouldn't be dropped until the then united states president's term of office ended a year later. The next day everyone was warned of the danger of violent clashes around the place only to find that it was a false alarm. There were half as many people on the street. However as long as you kept up with the news and stayed away from places where there were demonstrations Osaka was safe."},{"pid":"8ede8a3b3e5b226c6b7f6c4185e26006fbe17b0b","tid":1798276,"uid":197098,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-03T07:05:51.000Z","msg":"On the same day, a bus crash killed twenty three passengers.

Vince Carter's brother Mark had a press conference originally along with eleven other people but it was delayed for three hours. As time went by tempers flared and harsh words were exchanged. As violence flared up people scuffled. Several people who dressed in flared jeans were injured in scuffles with the security guards. As fighting flared up even some of the security guards were injured. Mark went back home before the news conference began because he threw a barbecue party at his place. Some of his friends spilt tol much oil on the steaks causing the barbecue to flare up. There was a sudden flare when his friends were barbecuing some chicken. As time passed the sky was getting darker so they began lighting candles. Some of the candles flared and flickered. Others flickered and went out. Mark set off the fireworks. His sister sarah helped let off the fireworks as well. The rest stood there admiring the flares of the fireworks. After three hours the press conference finally began during which conflict flared up. At one point the conflict threatened to flare into a lawsuit. Half an hour later the conflict quieted down but trouble began to flare in several cities simultaneously. Sarah has lots of clothes in her wardrobe such as a formal dress that flares out into a train, a pair of flares that flares at the ankle, a skirt that flares just above the knees, a pair of chinos that flares just above the ankle and a skirt with flares. Sarah has a breezy smile and a breezy personality. She's an easy-going type of person who has a breezy manner. Mark has broken up with his girlfriend lately so he's a bit down.

Successful couples say that this international bestseller is worth its weight in gold. You can also find a social worker for what it's worth. Joe is in a mood. He's in a bad mood. He said &quot;I'm in no mood for chatting&quot; His friends said &quot;he's in one of his moods- ignore him.&quot; They're keeping out of his way.
