To take it to an extreme: there were no good members of the gestapo because there was no way to carry out the directives of the gestapo and to be a good person. it is the same with the american police state. the job of the police is not to protect and serve, but to dominate, control, and terrorize in order to maintain the interests of state and capital.<br />\n<br />\nI also imagine most members of the gestapo also thought they were serving their country and doing good.<br />\n<br />\nWho are the good cops then?
