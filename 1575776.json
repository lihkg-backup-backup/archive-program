His family received a Notice of Criminal Detention this evening (16 September 2019), which stated that Lai was suspected of picking quarrels and provoking troubles. Lai&rsquo;s young son witnessed the brutal arrest of his father first handed, watching him being pushed to the ground by a gang of unknown men, then was left behind alone at home. The child was traumatized and cried all night, worried sick about his father. <br />\n<br />\nLai uploaded a video last Friday to his Wechat Moment and Facebook account, which has the background music 「Glory to Hong Kong」. The video shows scenery near his home town, and was posted with the caption 「This is my homeland, I want her to be free!」. The Chinese authorities is having a widespread crackdown on internet speech in recent days, specifically targeting Hong Kong related speech, and it is suspected that Lai was hence targeted. Lai was administratively detained in April this year for wearing a T-shirt with the words 「civil disobedience」; coupled with the timing near the trial of the Occupy Central Nine, his action was interpreted to be in support of the nine Hong Kong activists. In August after the eruption of the Anti-Extradiction Bill protests, Lai was forced to write a statement, promising that he would not go to Hong Kong before 10 October for tourism, shopping or other activities, and also that he would not posted sensitive speech online. <br />\n<br />\nLai is a long time member of the Southern Street Movement, and has been repeatedly detained for his activism. Three other members of the Southern Street Movement had been previously sentenced to four to four and a half years imprisonment for supporting the Umbrella Movement in 2014, and were only released recently.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n廣州果然係革命基地<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8b6ea885fffce539332904cdc7c7d08ed492eca4","tid":1575776,"uid":33930,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-17T03:22:37.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/TrPZKfU.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FTrPZKfU.jpg&h=433e1fe6&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"1f8c5def3081b8e2df61221e9613c40c1d38b7b3","tid":1575776,"uid":90601,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-17T03:23:26.000Z","msg":"烈士 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"9481e615402368ea393fdf8710c9ae6dae9845d0","tid":1575776,"uid":274161,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-17T03:25:41.000Z","msg":"勿讓香港變中國，我地如果輸左就係一樣下場"},{"pid":"0c11e3614e73f4cfb6e253c5bbc4f535b24acc8f","tid":1575776,"uid":274475,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-17T03:41:25.000Z","msg":"佢都係我地足兄弟，釋放義士！！！<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ba42051b040ccf8446bcf06e896300f69198ba6f","tid":1575776,"uid":22675,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-17T04:00:54.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/smile.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"dfe0e09c1f677961ddc9cd3ac8d17dea3b9e0e57","tid":1575776,"uid":22675,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-17T16:17:53.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/mf/smile.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
