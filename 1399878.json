Hongkongers have tried their best to voice their views on the extradition law. They are unarmed citizens who truly love HK. However, the government responds with excessive police force and provoking lies. The police even cooperate with the triad society to attack innocent passengers in Yuen Long Station. Over the weeks, all the Hongkongers are heartbroken. On the fifth of August (Monday), Hongkongers will go on a strike to express our views to the government. We hope the government can treat our views seriously. We, Hongkongers, sincerely need you to join us, on the strike day. <br />\nYou&rsquo;re one of us! <br />\n<br />\nBe strong and keep fighting! <br />\nHongkongers"}]}
