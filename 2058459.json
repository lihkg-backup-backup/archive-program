There was <strong>no evidence</strong>, however, that <strong>white supremacists were causing violence at any of the protests</strong>, the document said.<br />\n<br />\nDHS spokesman Alexei Woltornist said the agency would &quot;hold those responsible for the unrest accountable,&quot; but did not specifically comment on the intelligence assessment.<br />\n<br />\nThe White House and the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.<br />\n<br />\nPeople took to the streets to protest the killing of a black man, George Floyd, by a white police officer who pinned Floyd's neck under a knee for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis on May 25.<br />\n<br />\nIn the days that followed, protests in several U.S. cities descended into looting and clashes with police officers, who are using a variety of weapons here on protesters. Most protests have been peaceful, and on Tuesday night, there was less looting and vandalism and clashes were more sporadic even as crowds defied curfews.<br />\n<br />\nTrump has cast part of the blame for violence on Antifa, which is <strong>not an organization but rather an amorphous movement that opposes authoritarianism</strong>.<br />\n<br />\n連登仔點睇 係咪仲要跟Fox/CNN 繼續話looting等等同antifa/white supremacist有關<img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/please.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d33a0ab9cc248bdf60e8571bc29163e18345010b","tid":2058459,"uid":155095,"like":9,"dislike":0,"score":9,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-10T07:35:22.000Z","msg":"咁同中國有冇關先 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/wonder2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6f2d4855a70b8c62fdd874ddd44ee9e4c2a8423f","tid":2058459,"uid":202636,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"d33a0ab9cc248bdf60e8571bc29163e18345010b","tid":2058459,"uid":155095,"like":9,"dislike":0,"score":9,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-10T07:35:22.000Z","msg":"咁同中國有冇關先 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/wonder2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-10T07:43:10.000Z","msg":"點知<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/math.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />傳媒係負責報導事實not conspiracy <img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/please.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6b2a47eb300ab5ce7b9b6941a94446e124bd2149","tid":2058459,"uid":21545,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-06-10T07:45:27.000Z","msg":"Trump <img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"4d1af9beb8a7352b73a1b7991af5ac05296474f3","tid":2058459,"uid":143343,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-06-10T07:49:21.000Z","msg":"侵侵安撫民心又贏"},{"pid":"61207ec6bf4ef4cc574db5b2256397f04aa566f7","tid":2058459,"uid":144626,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"6f2d4855a70b8c62fdd874ddd44ee9e4c2a8423f","tid":2058459,"uid":202636,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"d33a0ab9cc248bdf60e8571bc29163e18345010b","tid":2058459,"uid":155095,"like":9,"dislike":0,"score":9,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-10T07:35:22.000Z","msg":"咁同中國有冇關先 <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/wonder2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-10T07:43:10.000Z","msg":"點知<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/math.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />傳媒係負責報導事實not conspiracy <img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/please.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-10T07:53:26.000Z","msg":"西霉就算有都唔會講"},{"pid":"c47191e8bc29d5172a8be9797be79829bc7a1cdb","tid":2058459,"uid":202636,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"6b2a47eb300ab5ce7b9b6941a94446e124bd2149","tid":2058459,"uid":21545,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-06-10T07:45:27.000Z","msg":"Trump <img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/fs/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-06-10T07:53:27.000Z","msg":"六個鐘前出<img src=\"/assets/faces/mouse/please.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN23H06J\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Famp%2Fs%2Fmobile.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Famp%2FidUSKBN23H06J&d=TNVh%2FXBsTmD9bRjMILuVa%2FulYLG83ImyreQ67A6WOt4%3D&h=48dfb40c\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN23H06J</a><br />\n<br />\nLittle evidence of antifa links in U.S. prosecutions of those charged in protest violence<br />\n<br />\nWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department moved swiftly to bring federal charges against 53 individuals accused of violence during nationwide protests that swept across the United States calling for an end to police brutality.<br />\n<br />\nAttorney General William Barr promised a crackdown on members of the anti-fascist movement known as antifa and other &quot;extremists&quot; he blamed for helping to drive the violence.<br />\n<br />\nBut a Reuters examination of federal court records related to the charges, social media posts by some of the suspects and interviews with defense lawyers and prosecutors found mostly disorganized acts of violence by people who have few obvious connections to antifa or other left-wing groups<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nReuters reviewed only federal cases, both because of the allegations by the Justice Department about the involvement of antifa and similar groups, and since federal charges generally carry harsher penalties.
