Meanwhile, second place Samsung shipped 53.7 million smartphones, a 30% plunge versus the same period last year. <br />\n<br />\nIt is the first time that Huawei has snagged the top spot for a single quarter, an ambition it has had for several years.  <br />\n<br />\nBut analysts cast doubt over whether this was sustainable given the fact Huawei&rsquo;s overseas markets outside of China took a hit as a result of U.S. sanctions against the company.<br />\n<br />\nHuawei sold over 70% of its smartphones in mainland China in the second quarter. Meanwhile, smartphone shipments in international markets plunged 27% year-on-year in the April to June quarter. <br />\n<br />\nIn Europe, a key region for Huawei, the company&rsquo;s smartphone market share fell sharply to 16% in the second quarter versus 22% in the same period in 2019, according to Counterpoint Research. It is the third-largest smartphone maker in Europe behind Samsung and Apple, showing how Huawei&rsquo;s global position in the second quarter was built on efforts to expand its share in China, the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nGiven the massive population of China, success there often propels companies to a large &ldquo;global&rdquo; market share. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;It will be hard for Huawei to maintain its lead in the long term,&rdquo; Mo Jia, analyst at Canalys, said in a press release. &ldquo;Its major channel partners in key regions, such as Europe, are increasingly wary of ranging Huawei devices, taking on fewer models, and bringing in new brands to reduce risk.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Strength in China alone will not be enough to sustain Huawei at the top once the global economy starts to recover,&rdquo;  he said."},{"pid":"0cd07acb03102a6c7c48fc49a465435428e993c4","tid":2131576,"uid":28114,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-30T03:40:20.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c8c3c5f40d6ed62d41a5000c0b693928abeb52ea","tid":2131576,"uid":66087,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-07-30T04:19:11.000Z","msg":"華為舊年5月開始比美國禁售晶片，冇哂美國貨<br />\n<br />\n支那自製芯片頂多去到14nm<br />\n<br />\n硬件不及人地，唔撐得幾耐 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hehe.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
