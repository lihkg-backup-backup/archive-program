The reason I stand out is that Hong Kong has developed my values and given me too much, I have to take the responsibility for this place.<br />\n<br />\nThe balance and separation of executive, legislative and judicial powers have been lost in Hong Kong. The abuse of authority in administration, miscarriage of justice and ineffectiveness in legislation are exposed. Why should we still foster our hopes within this frame.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hong Kong Communist Government and ruffianly police keep cracking down on us, but we are still standing firm and persevere with the Spirit of Lion Rock, I believe everyone has the same feeling.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong&rsquo;s Cantonese and traditional Chinese are the cultures that Hong Kongers of every generation want to pass on. No matter what your political views are, I believe you, as a Hong Konger, can say this out bravely: Cantonese is my mother tongue.<br />\n<br />\nThe sentence &lsquo;Hong Kong People ruling Hong Kong, High Degree of Autonomy&rsquo; in the Basic Law is distorted to be not equal to &lsquo;One Country, Two Systems&rsquo;. I guess everyone knows who breaches the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Basic Law.<br />\n<br />\nOn yesterday, the 30th September, 2019, some of our brothers announced the official establishment of Hong Kong Provisional Parliament and read out the  Civil Charter of Hong Kong outside the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in Central. As a Hong Konger, I will read out the Declaration of the Establishment of Hong Kong Provisional Parliament in (district), to tell the Hong Kong citizens in (district), and all civilians who support democracy and liberty in the world that Hong Kongers will take back our political power and return it to the people. <br />\n<br />\nThe Hong Kong Civil Charter shows the core values of Hong Kongers, it delineates 7 principles of parliamentary democracy, and a parliament structure which a President is directly elected by the citizens of Hong Kong via universal suffrage. Every part in the Civil Charter can be discussed or amended. The aim is the enhancement of civil consciousness and establishment of democracy. Now, I will read out the 7 principles in the Civil Charter (the latest revised version):<br />\n<br />\n1. Universal suffrage <br />\n2. Direct Democracy<br />\n3. Permanent protection of freedom of assembly and association <br />\n4. Illegal abuse of power by the police is regarded as a violation against the Charter <br />\n5. Accountability of Political Actors, return the political power to the people<br />\n6. Judicial Independence <br />\n7. Sovereignty of the people, Self-determination<br />\n<br />\nHong Kongers&rsquo; freedom and rights should not be exploited and restricted, any form of restriction is against the spirit of human rights. Hong Kong is developed by all Hong Kongers, the mutual spirit of Hong Kongers is the spirit of Hong Kong, so everything in Hong Kong must be determined by Hong Kongers, the intervention of any external power is absolutely intolerable. Hong Kongers will be be controlled by any politician or political power who is lack of representativeness, uses abused power or violates the Charter. Political power must be accompanied with a comprehensive system for mutual balance.<br />\n<br />\nSelf determination by Hong Kongers must be achieved.<br />\nWe won&rsquo;t beg, it isn&rsquo;t an extravagant hope.<br />\nBecause it belongs to us, Hong Kongers.<br />\nBecause the political system in Hong Kong now is corrupted, as Hong Kongers, we cannot tolerate anymore.<br />\n<br />\nToday, on 1st October, 2019, I announce again, the Hong Kong Provisional Parliament is officially established.<br />\n<br />\nGlory to Hong Kong!<br />\n<br

/>\n<br />\nDeclaration of the Establishment of the Hong Kong Provisional Parliament (To be read in the Six Districts)<br />\n<br />\nI am a Hong Konger born and bred, and just like every one of you, I love our city. Today I stand out, because Hong Kong has cultivated my values and given me too much, that I must take responsibility for our homeland.<br />\n<br />\nThe separation and balance of the executive, legislative and judicial powers have been ravaged in Hong Kong. The abuse of administrative authority, miscarriage of justice, and impotence in legislation are laid bare. Why should we still hold our hopes within such political framework?<br />\n<br />\nDespite the Hong Kong Communist Government and the cruel and corrupt police repeated crackdown, we continue to stand firm and persevere with the Spirit of Lion Rock. This is an emotion we brothers-and-sisters-in-arms share.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong&rsquo;s Cantonese and Traditional Chinese are cultures that Hong Kongers of every generation want to pass on. Regardless of political views, I believe you can bravely declare: I am a Hong Konger; my mother tongue is Cantonese.<br />\n<br />\nThe principle of &lsquo;Hong Kong People ruling Hong Kong, High Degree of Autonomy' promised in the Basic Law, has been distorted not to align with &lsquo;One Country, Two Systems&rsquo;. It is obvious that the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Basic Law has been shamelessly breached by a certain oppressor.<br />\n<br />\nYesterday, on 30th September, 2019, outside the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in Central, our brothers announced the official establishment of the Hong Kong Provisional Parliament and proclaimed the Civil Charter of Hong Kong. As a Hong Konger, I shall, too, proclaim the Declaration of the Establishment of Hong Kong Provisional Parliament in [my district], to inform the Hong Kong citizens in [my district], and all who support democracy and liberty around the world, that Hong Kongers shall take back our political power and return it to the people.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hong Kong Civil Charter denotes the core values of Hong Kongers, outlines 7 principles of parliamentary democracy and a parliament structure in which the president is directly elected by the citizens of Hong Kong via universal suffrage. Every part in the Civil Charter is open for discussion and amendment. The Charter aims to enhance civil consciousness and actualize democracy. Now, I shall state the 7 principles in the Civil Charter (according to the latest revision):<br />\n<br />\n1. Universal suffrage;<br />\n2. Direct democracy;<br />\n3. Permanent protection of the freedoms of assembly and association;<br />\n4. Classification of the illegal abuse of law enforcement power as a violation against the Charter;<br />\n5. Accountability of Political Actors, restoring the political power of the people;<br />\n6. Judicial independence;<br />\n7. Sovereignty and self-determination of the people.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kongers&rsquo;s freedom and rights shall not be exploited or restricted. Any form of such restriction is a defilement of the spirit of human rights. Hong Kong is fostered by Hong Kongers, and the will of Hong Kongers is the will of Hong Kong; therefore, Hong Kong&rsquo;s determination belongs solely to Hong Kongers, and no intervention from any external power shall be tolerated. No politicians or regime which lack representativeness, abuse power, or violate the Charter, shall reign over Hong Kong. Political power and a comprehensive political system must exist together to keep each other in check.<br />\n<br />\nHong Kongers shall achieve self-determination.<br />\nWe shall not beg. We shall not fantasize.<br />\nBecause Hong Kongers are the sole, rightful heirs to the autonomy of Hong Kong;<br />\nBecause Hong Kongers can no longer remain silent against the corrupt political system.<br />\n<br />\nToday, on 1st October, 2019, I declare again&mdash;the Hong Kong Provisional Parliament is officially established.<br />\n<br />\nGlory to Hong Kong!"},{"pid":"f6f09d9fc273750fe9e14a3fd54faaac778909cc","tid":1607719,"uid":104833,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-01T08:29:24.000Z","msg":"比link 先rt到喎"},{"pid":"9624bc77c8ee07c9dcbe32a266dba6c172cc5f6b","tid":1607719,"uid":25825,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-01T08:29:50.000Z","msg":"J"},{"pid":"ba5b367f47bace6c740b41f09b930b7acc1f019c","tid":1607719,"uid":25825,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-01T08:30:11.000Z","msg":"Y"},{"pid":"d36800746e02ab29c30dd63b0a27f204a3073723","tid":1607719,"uid":94968,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-01T08:31:00.000Z","msg":"P"},{"pid":"0830d4e6d8e68d7f3de5858629e2c05b2307ba7e","tid":1607719,"uid":25825,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-01T17:02:42.000Z","msg":"Link?"}]}
