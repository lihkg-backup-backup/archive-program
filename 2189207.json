One banker described it as a &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; bet.<br />\n<br />\n......<br />\n<br />\nOne person familiar with SoftBank&rsquo;s trades said it was &ldquo;gobbling up&rdquo; options on a scale that was even making some people within the organisation nervous. &ldquo;People are caught with their pants down, massively short.

The whale is still hungry.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n......<br />\n<br />\nThe size and aggressiveness of the mysterious call buyer, coupled with the summer trading lull, has been a major factor in not only the buoyant performance of many big tech names, but the broader US stock market, according to Mr McElligott. This week he warned that dynamics around options meant the heavy purchases forced banks on the other side of the trades to hedge themselves by buying stocks, in a &ldquo;classic &lsquo;tail wags the dog&rsquo; feedback loop&rdquo;.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThis also helped explain the unusual sight of the US stock market climbing in tandem with the Vix index &mdash; often referred to as Wall Street&rsquo;s &ldquo;fear gauge&rdquo; &mdash; and meant that equities were fragile and vulnerable to the kind of sudden setback that erupted on Thursday. &ldquo;The equity volatility complex is acting &lsquo;broken&rsquo; and indicative that &lsquo;something&rsquo;s gotta give&rsquo;,&rdquo; Mr McElligott warned in a note shortly before the Nasdaq fell 5 per cent.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n......"},{"pid":"d0c0872f590f4c9d4866deaafe60c4229f464196","tid":2189207,"uid":169195,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-05T02:42:05.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/oh.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"59fb62199da8bf70376778434436dff94ec69cc6","tid":2189207,"uid":169195,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-05T04:15:37.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/oh.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
