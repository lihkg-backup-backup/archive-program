The character he embodied on The Walking Dead, Hershel, lived at the emotional core of the show,&quot; said AMC. &quot;Like Scott in our lives, Hershel was a character whose actions continue to inform our character&rsquo;s choices to this day. Our hearts go out to his wife, his family, friends and to the millions of fans who loved him. Scott will be missed.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nWhile Wilson was best known for his role as Hershel, which he played for seasons 2, 3 and 4, he was a veteran actor who also did amazing work in Judge Dredd, In Cold Blood and The Right Stuff, among other credits.<br />\n<br />\nThe news of Wilson&rsquo;s death came almost in the same hour that it was announced that he would actually be returning to The Walking Dead in season 9, briefly. While Hershel met his end in season 4 at the hands of the Governor, Wilson, along with Jon Bernthal (Shane) and Sonequa Martin-Green (Sasha) will all be making an appearance in the first half of season 9 all the same, according to a reveal at an NYCC panel.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"f83f5947d8fe1900ce244b1930cd5e152b0d15a1","tid":852126,"uid":47840,"like":2,"dislike":3,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-10-07T15:28:41.000Z","msg":"係 比人斬斷頭"},{"pid":"e26b18d00adf086682e33e58dbf9f57e1587e7cc","tid":852126,"uid":4206,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"quote":{"pid":"f83f5947d8fe1900ce244b1930cd5e152b0d15a1","tid":852126,"uid":47840,"like":2,"dislike":3,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-10-07T15:28:41.000Z","msg":"係 比人斬斷頭"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-10-07T15:31:14.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"fb84711c900d7689affa75bf8c1a0e3e72631310","tid":852126,"uid":137018,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-10-07T15:55:22.000Z","msg":"Cancer<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
