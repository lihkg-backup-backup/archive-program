For external audiences, Xinhua talks about China in overwhelmingly positive tones. Articles are about how China is advancing, its leadership is wise, ect. This is the straightforward propaganda aspect of Xinhua. <br />\n<br />\n3. Xinhua's tone about the United States has gotten markedly more negative every year since 2015. This is most likely a reflection of heightened US-China tensions. The effect is especially pronounced when talking about US relations with other democracies. <br />\n<br />\n4. Xinhua's tone about Xinjiang has become more &quot;positive&quot; and upbeat since mid/late 2018 when China's policies there began to attract sustained international attention. Its response to criticism appears to deflect it with propaganda about how great the situation is."},{"pid":"5ddffbc277aa32ffaac959c28b22bf2ff8f39edc","tid":2241289,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-19T11:54:04.000Z","msg":"Vincenzo Amendola, Italian Minister for European Affairs: &ldquo;the BRI MoU with China was a mistake.

It also &quot;publishes dictionaries, children&acute;s books, reference books, science fiction, and fiction both translated and in the original.&quot; Its slogan is &quot;Educational Books From Estonia.&quot; Koolibri did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is unclear how or whether the Koolibri company, which appears to be a legit book publisher, is involved in this at all.<br />\n<br />\nProud Boys didn&rsquo;t respond to VICE News&rsquo; email inquiry, but on social media they were bristling about the apparent voter intimidation campaign. Proud Boys&rsquo; Seattle Chapter put out a PSA on Telegram, calling the emails a &ldquo;false flag operation and a larp being carried out by someone who is soon to be exposed.&rdquo; That message was distributed to other Telegram channels associated with the Proud Boys. (Disclosure: Gavin McInnes founded the Proud Boys in 2016. He was also a co-founder of VICE. He left the company in 2008 and has had no involvement since then.)<br />\n<br />\nADVERTISEMENT<br />\n<br />\nProud Boy organizer Joe Biggs chimed in on Parler. &ldquo;This is such BS,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;We don't do that none of this stuff even is remotely attached to us. It will be funny when it goes straight back to the bitch who's making this all up. More desperation from the left to attack good men who stand up against evil.<br />\n<br />\nProud Boy Chairman Enrique Tarrio, who briefly ran for Senate in Florida, called the email campaign a &ldquo;fucking bold face lie&rdquo; on Parler and said he was in the process of contacting the FBI. He also suggested it was &ldquo;some type of left wing ploy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whoever did this needs to rot in prison,&rdquo; Tarrio added.<br />\n<br />\nIntense polarization, a surge in extremist activity and uptick in political violence has left election officials on high alert for possible voter intimidation this year. Those concerns became even more pronounced following the presidential debate in September, when President Donald Trump urged supporters to &ldquo;go into the polls and watch very carefully.&rdquo; When asked to condemn far-right groups like the Proud Boys, Trump responded &ldquo;Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"b48df2d2a651ca2cb4c39e0ee1e5b193ea3a07ca","tid":2241289,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-21T12:18:07.000Z","msg":"Proud Boys took his words as both tacit endorsement and marching orders, and almost immediately began working on a new line of merch emblazoned with &ldquo;Stand back , stand by.&rdquo; (Trump later claimed his comments were misinterpreted by viewers).<br />\n<br />\nDespite the threatening language, the man said he wasn't really worried about the people behind the email.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;[I'm not] not particularly bothered given that I know they&rsquo;re full of crap and how they got the data,&quot; the man told VICE. &quot;But worried about how other people might interpret it.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/88a43b/proud-boys-emails-threatening-florida-voters-appear-to-use-spoofed-email-address\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen%2Farticle%2F88a43b%2Fproud-boys-emails-threatening-florida-voters-appear-to-use-spoofed-email-address&d=uoj2XAvVwhv3g67ADWIJbQjGR3CVFSgRSSfEWrWQqBA%3D&h=c6a8a97c\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.vice.com/en/article/88a43b/proud-boys-emails-threatening-florida-voters-appear-to-use-spoofed-email-address</a>"},{"pid":"7b7fac801851a23482025516bfe6fe5234559701","tid":2241289,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-21T12:25:24.000Z","msg":"<span class=\"orange\"><strong>Trump Records Shed New Light on Chinese Business Pursuits</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<blockquote><br />\nBut Mr. Trump&rsquo;s own business history is filled with overseas financial deals, and some have involved the Chinese state.

There are currently only eight justices on the usually nine-member court following the death last month of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which left the court with a 5-3 conservative majority.<br />\n<br />\nChief Justice John Roberts joined the three liberal justices in denying the request, with five votes needed for it to be granted.<br />\n<br />\nThe decision highlights the impact that President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, could have as a potential deciding vote in election-related cases if -- as expected -- she is confirmed by the Republican-led Senate next week.

And we need to have global co-operation,&quot; she added.<br />\n<br />\nThe health minister has previously defended China&rsquo;s handling of the outbreak.

Liberal strongholds.<br />\n<br />\nThe win shows the NDP has managed to use its razor-thin minority government, established in 2017, to gain the support of the province and overcome an image problem haunting it since the 1990s. At the same time, the B.C. Liberals lay in tatters with their worst election showing in decades.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I believe that for three and a half years we focused on the needs of all British Columbians,&rdquo; NDP leader John Horgan said at a media conference Sunday morning. &ldquo;I was reaching out always to communities, to people, to businesses in every corner of the province talking about the values that I want to bring to government.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThough the NDP managed to break through in Vancouver&rsquo;s suburbs, parts of rural B.C. remained out of reach. Horgan promised to visit ridings in the province&rsquo;s interior more often to &ldquo;be the spokesperson for the issues that we&rsquo;re bringing forward that will benefit rural British Columbia.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThose issues include the province&rsquo;s troubled forestry industry, he added.<br />\n<br />\nHorgan said he decided to call the snap election to push for a majority government to better handle issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2017, shortly after the Liberals had won a minority government in the provincial election, the New Democrats teamed up with the B.C. Green Party to topple them and establish an agreement to give the NDP their minority government.<br />\n<br />\nA surge in approval ratings for NDP leader Horgan followed, almost reaching 70 per cent in some surveys this year. The province&rsquo;s handling of the pandemic was credited as the reason for Horgan&rsquo;s popularity.<br />\n<br />\nThough the B.C.

Berlin, however, got bogged down in messy coalition talks that dragged on for months. It never really engaged with Macron or gave him an adequate response. I mention this episode because I see worrying signs that a similar dynamic could play out in transatlantic discussions over China if Joe Biden is elected president this week. Like Macron three years ago, Biden is promising to work with Germany and other EU member states on a complex and hugely consequential policy challenge. For Macron it was overhauling Europe. For Biden it is forging a transatlantic agenda on China. For this to work, Germany will have to play ball. It will have to come up with its own ideas for what transatlantic cooperation on China should look like. It will have to rally other EU member states around a common strategy. And it will have to be ready to engage with a new U.S. administration &ndash; if we get one &ndash; from day one. In the end, Germany will have to know what it wants &ndash; not just what it doesn&rsquo;t want. I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;re there yet.<br />\n<br />\nFor one thing, there does not appear to be a great deal of urgency in Berlin for putting together a list of priority agenda items on China that Europe could present to Biden. Yes, Merkel did call an EU summit for mid-November to discuss China policy. That would have been the ideal forum for such a discussion. But the meeting was cancelled almost as soon as it was announced due to the surge in COVID-19 infections across Europe. When pressed on the issue, a senior German diplomat told me that Berlin could come up with a list of transatlantic agenda items for China in a few days, with WTO reform at the top. &ldquo;In any case there is no rush. If Biden does win, his administration is unlikely to be fully up and running until the early summer,&rdquo; I was told. That may be true. But working through the highly complex issues around technology engagement with China will take time. So will forging a common European line on these issues. In a speech last week, German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer warned against a policy of &quot;unilateral isolation and decoupling&quot; from China and floated the idea of a US-EU trade deal. But a debate that goes beyond preserving free trade will be needed. This doesn&rsquo;t appear to be happening.<br />\n<br />\nAnother complication for a future transatlantic discussion is the lack of clear signals from the Biden camp. Macron knew what he wanted to do with Europe and offered Germany and European partners detailed policy proposals. But as several German and EU diplomats stressed to me, there are China hawks and doves in the Biden team and little clarity about who will have the upper hand. Biden himself has sent different signals on China throughout the campaign. Last year, he said China was &ldquo;not competition for us&rdquo;, before describing them this year as a &ldquo;serious competitor&rdquo; (but not an opponent). In his most recent debate with Donald Trump, he promised to &ldquo;get China to play by international laws&rdquo;, when it has become abundantly clear in recent years that Beijing will not. Signals from Biden&rsquo;s entourage suggest they will be looking for input from Europe and other allies about how to proceed with China &ndash; on trade, technology and other aspects of the relationship. That will be welcomed in some capitals after four years of &ldquo;America First&rdquo;. But it also means that Europe will need to figure out where it stands.<br />\n<a href=\"https://sites-gmf.vuturevx.com/61/6509/october-2020/november-2020.asp\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsites-gmf.vuturevx.com%2F61%2F6509%2Foctober-2020%2Fnovember-2020.asp&d=uoj2XAvVwhv3g67ADWIJbQjGR3CVFSgRSSfEWrWQqBA%3D&h=c3dfcf9a\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://sites-gmf.vuturevx.com/61/6509/october-2020/november-2020.asp</a>"},{"pid":"6d276b2c4c54a9ad0ea08897721a4d4b87183d6b","tid":2241289,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-02T11:06:41.000Z","msg":"What worries me more than any lack of clarity from the Biden camp, however, is that Germany &ndash; as it was for many months after Macron&rsquo;s speech in 2017 &ndash; will be &ldquo;mit sich selbst besch&auml;ftigt&rdquo; (preoccupied with itself). Next year is what is known in Germany as a &ldquo;Superwahljahr&rdquo; (a year full of elections).  In addition to the federal election in September, six of Germany&rsquo;s 16 states are due to vote in 2021 &ndash; the largest number in a decade. The country&rsquo;s politicians will be focused inward. Merkel will be riding off into the sunset. And the uncertainty over who might replace her &ndash; exacerbated by an increasingly fraught contest to pick a new leader of her conservative party &ndash; will be high. This will make it all the more difficult for Germany to engage. If he is elected, Biden might want to make his first call to Macron for a little advice.<br />\n<br />\nConnectivity Wars<br />\nUrsula von der Leyen came into office a year ago vowing to turn the European Commission into a geopolitical force. But on the issue of connectivity, where the EU is ideally placed to project its economic power and values &ndash; not to mention create a compelling counter-narrative to China's &ndash; her Commission has been silent. Connectivity is not a sexy term. But get beyond the drab catchphrase and the significance is apparent. It is about ports, electricity grids and telecommunications networks &ndash; the critical infrastructure that is, in the words of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, vital to the resilience of economies and political systems around the world. China realized the importance of connectivity years ago, unveiling its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013. Five years later, the EU produced its response to the BRI (while earnestly assuring everyone that it was not one) in the form of a joint communication entitled &ldquo;Connecting Europe and Asia &ndash; Building blocks for an EU Strategy&rdquo;. Now, a turf war has erupted in Brussels over the future of that strategy.<br />\n<br />\nGermany, backed by France, other member states and officials at the European External Action Service (EEAS), views it as woefully inadequate and is pushing for a revamp. Speaking at a MERICS conference in September, Michael Clauss, the German ambassador to the EU, called for something &ldquo;very visible&rdquo; that is &ldquo;at the level of Belt and Road&rdquo;. The current strategy, he said, &ldquo;sounds like it was invented by bureaucrats, which it obviously was&rdquo;. Among the ideas that have been floated are a catchy new name (the French have proposed &ldquo;Magellan&rdquo;), a broader geographic focus (including Africa and Latin America), and a high-ranking special envoy to complement Romana Vlahutin, the Croatian diplomat who serves as EEAS ambassador for connectivity. It would involve robust funding commitments (a Franco-German non-paper last year called for the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and national financial institutions to play an important role). But above all, a new strategy would replace dreamy language about spreading peace and prosperity with clear geopolitical intent. As several diplomats pointed out to me, the 2018 strategy now feels like it was produced in a different era &ndash; before the 5G debate erupted in Europe, before the EU labeled China a &ldquo;systemic rival&rdquo;, before wolf warriors and mask diplomacy, before the national security law in Hong Kong, and before the confrontation between the United States and China shifted into overdrive."},{"pid":"2eca131b3800b0b4e3083513dd12cd6e24b07e78","tid":2241289,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-02T11:06:54.000Z","msg":"One would expect a geopolitical revamp to be right up von der Leyen&rsquo;s alley. But I was told by numerous EU officials that her cabinet, preoccupied with Europe&rsquo;s Green Deal and the pandemic, has refused to engage on the issue. Not only were German-French demands for a special envoy based in the Commission ignored, but the term &ldquo;connectivity&rdquo; did not appear once in the mission letters von der Leyen sent out to her new commissioners. Von der Leyen has also refused to intervene in a tug-of-war between the EEAS and the Commission's Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development, which helps oversee the disbursement of EU development aid outside the bloc. DG DEVCO, as it is known, has vigorously defended the status quo, fearful that a more robust, geopolitical approach would hand strategic control over foreign projects to diplomats in the EEAS, I was told by Brussels-based diplomats and parliamentarians. Senior officials at DG DEVCO deny that, dismissing the dispute as a petty difference of opinion over branding. But others believe institutional infighting is obscuring big-picture goals. &ldquo;This turf war is an expression of the lack of geopolitical thinking in some corners of the Commission,&rdquo; according to Reinhard B&uuml;tikofer, a member of the European Parliament who just completed his own proposals on connectivity that will flow into a forthcoming report for the Parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Foreign Affairs.<br />\n<br />\nIn the coming weeks, Clauss is planning to take his ideas for a connectivity revamp to COREPER, the forum where ambassadors from EU member states meet to discuss policy. The goal is to get clear language on an overhaul of the strategy in European Council conclusions in December. But his struggles show that Brussels still has a ways to go in shifting to a geopolitical mindset &ndash; and in pushing back against China&rsquo;s global ambitions.<br />\n<br />\nChinese Influence Report<br />\nLastly, I thought it might be helpful to provide some context in the wake of a story by Axios last month about a German intelligence report on Chinese influence from 2018 that had been hushed up by a top official. The sources for the report were two former U.S. intelligence officials. What I know is that when Sigmar Gabriel became German foreign minister in 2017, he introduced regular coordination meetings on China across government ministries. In parallel, a report was put together in 2018 that looked at Chinese influence activities throughout Germany. Based on the recommendations from the report, the federal government began an awareness-raising campaign in German cities, states, universities and research institutes. One product of this exercise was a report published in September by the umbrella organization for German universities, laying out new guidelines for its members when working with Chinese counterparts."},{"pid":"2c6e69303a058e431e117c6194cdae36507736e5","tid":2241289,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-02T11:07:04.000Z","msg":"The broader 2018 report on Chinese influence activities was described to me as a fluid document that is being updated continuously.

And on rare occasions, it has gone public with specific accusations &ndash; for example, two years ago when it reported that Chinese intelligence was using fake LinkedIn accounts to gather information on German politicians. But in general, the intelligence community has always kept its findings closely guarded. I&rsquo;m told that there is now a debate within the government about whether the time has come for a more transparent approach.

In 2019, Pompeo broke with decades of American foreign policy to announce that the US under Trump no longer viewed Israel's settlements as &quot;inconsistent with international law.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nBut Palestinians and much of the world regard those settlements as illegal under international law. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/mike-pompeo-backs-west-bank-settlements-in-landmark-visit/a-55662272\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Fmike-pompeo-backs-west-bank-settlements-in-landmark-visit%2Fa-55662272&d=uoj2XAvVwhv3g67ADWIJbQjGR3CVFSgRSSfEWrWQqBA%3D&h=c282ab3a\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.dw.com/en/mike-pompeo-backs-west-bank-settlements-in-landmark-visit/a-55662272</a>"},{"pid":"64936f7219f88e648267de73f74240f7dfeb1b99","tid":2241289,"uid":177168,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-20T04:45:47.000Z","msg":"<strong><span class=\"orange\">Pro-Western candidate wins Moldovan presidential election</span></strong><br />\n<br />\nCHISINAU, Moldova (AP) &mdash; Maia Sandu, a former World Bank economist who favors closer ties with the European Union, has won Moldova&rsquo;s presidential runoff vote, decisively defeating the staunchly pro-Russian incumbent, according to preliminary results released Monday.<br />\n<br />\nSandu captured over 57% of the vote, leaving the incumbent, Igor Dodon, behind by over 15 points, according to preliminary data from the Central Election Commission, CEC, that said nearly 100% of the vote has been counted.<br />\n<br />\nSunday&rsquo;s election was seen as a referendum on two divergent visions for the future of the small Eastern European nation sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania. Sandu and Dodon, who Russian President Vladimir Putin identified as his preferred candidate, have been rivals since he narrowly defeated her in the 2016 presidential race.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;People voted in very large numbers ... they voted because they care, because they want their voices to be heard,&rdquo; Sandu, who promised during the campaign to secure more financial support from the EU, said late Sunday after it became apparent she was leading. &ldquo;People want the ones in power to offer solutions to their problems.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nOn Monday, Dodon conceded after the results were published and congratulated Sandu.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I call for calm and peace, absolutely no disturbances or protests, we must not allow any destabilization of the country,&rdquo; he said.<br />\n<br />\nThe current pro-Russian government controls only 51 of 101 seats in the parliament. The new president can dissolve parliament if the prime minister resigns and there are two failed attempts to find a successor.<br />\n<br />\nPutin on Monday congratulated Sandu and expressed hope that her work as the head of state &ldquo;contributes to the constructive development of relations&rdquo; between Russia and Moldova.<br />\n<br />\nEarlier in the day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow respects &ldquo;the choice of the Moldovan people&rdquo; and hopes to establish &ldquo;a working relationship&rdquo; with the new president.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;We know that Maia Sandu said she would work in the interests of the Moldovan people, and we&rsquo;re convinced that building good and close relations, cooperation in all areas with our country, Russia, is in the interest of the Moldovan people,&rdquo; Peskov told reporters.<br />\n<br />\nEver since gaining independence a year after the Soviet collapse in 1991, Moldova has been divided between those favoring closer relations with Europe and those who prefer stronger links with Moscow.<br />\n<br />\nMoldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe with nearly 1.2 million of its people estimated to be living abroad. It relies heavily on remittances, and closer ties with the EU are generally seen as more likely than those with Moscow to lead to a long-elusive political stability and economic recovery.<br />\n<br />\nYet in this election, those choices might have been overshadowed by the heavy social and economic toll inflicted on Moldova by the coronavirus pandemic. So far, the nation of 3.5 million people has tallied close to 89,000 virus cases and over 2,000 deaths. On Saturday, it reported a record 1,411 new daily infections.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2014, while it was run by a pro-European coalition, Moldova signed a deal on closer political and economic ties with the EU, now a bloc of 27 nations.

Maybe what we should do is talk about a few hotspots and then get back to the sort of overarching issue, if that works and I think the first thing that would be on a lot of people&rsquo;s mind would be the US-China relationship, where in some ways, oddly, even though US political climate has become very polarized, we&rsquo;ve seen a continuation. The Obama administration began a rebalance toward Asia. Today, you hear from many Democrats, as well as many Republicans a concern about what&rsquo;s going on in China and the future of the relationship. How do you see a Biden administration getting sort of setting itself up to deal with China?<br />\n<br />\nTony Blinken: Well, first of all, I think you&rsquo;re right. There is a growing consensus across parties that China poses a series of new challenges and that the status quo was really not sustainable particularly when it comes to China&rsquo;s commercial and economic practices, the lack of reciprocity in the relationships or something that couldn&rsquo;t be sustained and needed to be and continue to need to be dealt with.<br />\n<br />\nHere&rsquo;s the problem and again, take a step back, my concern now is that in terms of China&rsquo;s strategic interests and in terms of our own, China, as a result of the last three and a half years is in a stronger position and we&rsquo;re in a weaker position and that&rsquo;s what a Biden administration would have to start to rebuild from. What do I mean by that?<br />\n<br />\nIf you think about what China would hope to achieve strategically around the world, unfortunately, in my judgment, the Trump administration has helped them advance their interests. Weaker US alliances, China sees alliances as a core source of strength for the United States, something they don&rsquo;t share and enjoy. Unfortunately, the way President Trump has pursued his policies that&rsquo;s weakened, not strengthened our core alliances, particularly in Asia.<br />\n<br />\nInstitutions, China&rsquo;s trying to assert its own leadership in international institutions at the expense of our own. Well, our own withdrawal from virtually every institution you can think of has left an opening for China to fill.<br />\n<br />\nWhen it comes to values, our abdication of standing up for our own values and in Asia and with regard to China&rsquo;s actions, has, I think, given the government in Beijing, a sense of greater impunity when it comes to cracking down on democracy in Hong Kong or for that matter, dealing and abusing the human rights of Uyghurs in China.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, our own democracy, when it is weak, when it looks like it&rsquo;s in disarray, when it seems not to be delivering from for its people when people are questioning its legitimacy, that is arguably good for China because our model looks less attractive than it otherwise would. Well, I think President Trump, unfortunately, has led an assault on our own democracy, its institutions, its values, its people that is served to further delegitimize it, not just in the eyes of Americans but around the world. In that sense, I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re at a strategic disadvantage. China is at a strategic advantage at this particular moment."},{"pid":"68236cdb61b2ea38bdf5749b9abd2687a4782729","tid":2241289,"uid":138409,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-23T03:39:16.000Z","msg":"Having said that, how would we approach things? A few things that are worth underscoring, first, it&rsquo;s vital because we are in a competition with China and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with competition if it&rsquo;s fair. In fact, it hopefully brings out in some ways the best. We need, in the first instance, to invest in our own competitiveness. That means making some very fundamental reorientation of resources and priorities when it comes to investing in American infrastructure, American education, the health care system, our workers and their competitiveness.<br />\n<br />\nSecond, one of the things I think that&rsquo;s been a deficiency in the Trump administration&rsquo;s approach to contending with China is it&rsquo;s done so not with our allies and partners but without them, indeed while alienating them. We need to rally our allies and partners instead of alienating them to deal with some of the challenges that China poses.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, on trade, as you know, Walter, we&rsquo;re about 25% of world GDP alone. When we&rsquo;re working with allies and partners, depending on who we bring into the mix, it&rsquo;s 50 or 60% of GDP. That&rsquo;s a lot more weight and a lot harder for China to ignore.<br />\n<br />\nThird, we need to be standing up for our values and put them back at the center of our foreign policy, not walk away from them. We obviously need to be in a place to effectively deter aggression, if China pursues it.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, I think you&rsquo;d see a Biden demonstration having reestablished a relative strength in the relationship, then be able to engage China and work with China, in areas where our interests clearly overlap, whether it is again, contending with climate change, dealing with global health and pandemics, dealing with the spread of dangerous weapons. We&rsquo;re much better off though, finding ways to cooperate when we&rsquo;re acting from a position of strength than from a position of weakness."},{"pid":"753cb979c662e3ae4ed362263499f1cde836b529","tid":2241289,"uid":58670,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-24T02:02:25.000Z","msg":"<strong><span class=\"orange\">知歐派獲提名掌國務院</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n// 美國聯邦總務署星期一（23日）批准政府移交程序，而已宣佈當選美國總統的拜登當天也開始公佈其政府的官員任命，其中前常務副國務卿布林肯（Antony Blinken）獲提名出任國務卿，對歐洲來說是喜出望外的消息。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n布林肯出掌美國外交，基本上證實了大家之前某些推測。從美歐關係角度而言，布林肯本身是堅定多邊主義者，拜登會重新積極參與國際組織，多跟歐洲協調外交政策。 //<br />\n<br />\n// 目前盛傳下任國防部長熱門之一的 Michele Flournoy ，也是支持伊拉克戰爭，而且主張美國擴軍，她曾批評奧巴馬在軍事政策太軟弱，公開讚揚川普政府的軍事政策，在南海政策方面，她今年提出要在印太地區有震懾中國的力量，例如要顯示出有能力72小時內在南海炸毀中國全部軍事設施，這樣才能避免跟中國戢爭。 //<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://europechinese.blogspot.com/2020/11/blog-post_24.html?\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Feuropechinese.blogspot.com%2F2020%2F11%2Fblog-post_24.html%3F&d=uoj2XAvVwhv3g67ADWIJbQjGR3CVFSgRSSfEWrWQqBA%3D&h=5defc6e1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://europechinese.blogspot.com/2020/11/blog-post_24.html?</a>"},{"pid":"21fae4085c156dab13be776053c445019c20ebb0","tid":2241289,"uid":58670,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-11-27T15:33:06.000Z","msg":"<strong><strong><strong><span class=\"orange\">Iran's top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh assassinated near Tehran<br />\n</span></strong></strong></strong><br />\nIran's most senior nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh has been assassinated near the capital Tehran, the country's defence ministry has confirmed.<br />\n<br />\nFakhrizadeh died in hospital after being attacked in Damavand county.<br />\n<br />\nIranian news agencies said assailants targeted his car with a bomb before shooting at him.<br />\n<br />\nWestern intelligence agencies view him as the mastermind behind Iran's secret nuclear weapons programme.<br />\n<br />\nHe was reportedly been described as the &quot;father of the Iranian bomb&quot;
