On the 1st of October, 2019, HKPF officers fired live rounds at protestors in the areas Tsuen Wan, Mongkok and Wong Tai Sin. In Tsuen Wan, a police officer shot a F.5 student in the left lung with a pistol at point blank range, causing serious injuries to the teenager, putting him in critical condition.  <br />\n<br />\n身為香港教育工作者，作育英材、照顧學生身心成長是我們應盡之義。故此，<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">我們對於警方在十月一日以實彈近距離槍擊學生等暴行，以及特區行政長官的包庇縱容，<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">予以強烈譴責</span>。</span></strong><br />\nAs educators of Hong Kong, nurturing students and addressing students&rsquo; physical and psychological needs are our solemn responsibilities. As such, we strongly condemn the excessive force used by HKPF on 1st of October.  <br />\nAs educators of Hong Kong, nurturing students and addressing students&rsquo; physical and psychological needs are our solemn responsibilities. As such, we strongly condemn the acts of violence (such as the use of live ammunition on students at point blank range) by HKPF on 1st of October, and we also condemn the Chief Executive of the HKSAR for harbouring such acts.  <br />\n<br />\n同時，我們呼籲警方馬上停止使用過度、不對等、以及不必要的武力，並嚴正檢討執法時使用武力的指引。警方自六月起，在行動中濫權濫暴的情況罄竹難書，如多次選擇性執法，在鏡頭前放縱持刀襲擊巿民的凶徒；情緒失控不守警例，<strong><span style=\"color: green;\">推倒甚至暴力對待並無衝突或犯法的途人</span></strong>；<span style=\"color: orange;\">巧言令色歪曲事實，强將受槍傷的胸口指為膊頭等</span>，均惹來社會及國際多方譴責。<br />\nWe hereby urge the HKPF to cease all excessive, disproportionate and unjustified acts of violence, and solemnly evaluate the guidelines of the use of force in law enforcement. Since June, the HKPF has conducted scores of unlawful acts and excessive violence during its operations, such as selective law enforcement, where officers take no action against armed assailants, even when in front of cameras; out-of-control officers pushing and acting violently towards by-standers who were non-hostile and broke no law; dressing up facts such as claiming the officer shot the boy in the shoulder instead of the chest - all of which are rightfully condemned locally and internationally. <br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">凡此種種暴行</span></strong>，皆源於聲稱「只有三萬警隊」而放棄七百萬巿民的<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: orange;\">林鄭月娥及其政府，包庇縱容警隊濫暴，無止境破壞香港法理</span></strong></span>。香港警務處應馬上處分違規的警務人員，以儆效尤；並<span style=\"color: red;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong>全面改革警隊</strong></span></span>，使香港復歸和平理性。<br />\nThe above acts of violence stem from the Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the HKSAR Government who claimed they &ldquo;have nothing but the 30,000 in the Force&rdquo;, will fully neglecting the 7 million population, harbouring the violence of the HKPF and bringing down Hong Kong&rsquo;s rule of law relentlessly. The HKPF needs to bring disciplinary actions against law-breaking officers immediately, so as to put an end to such unacceptable behaviour, and carry out a comprehensive reform on the Force, in order to restore Hong Kong as a peaceful and rational city.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n二〇一九年十月二日<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong>教師簽名link:</strong></span><br />\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14o51zbEhorDmIm1Fk2-hLXce4pu1UZXHBpsaRf8BNjI/edit#responses\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2F14o51zbEhorDmIm1Fk2-hLXce4pu1UZXHBpsaRf8BNjI%2Fedit%23responses&d=beIwg85N8Ddzcl6rIyS0GdlAIsOV5GGnQ0mU6qdzh4w%3D&h=63c787f5\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14o51zbEhorDmIm1Fk2-hLXce4pu1UZXHBpsaRf8BNjI/edit#responses</a>"},{"pid":"5730ac4ae004e44105cbd87e890d659ce59cc945","tid":1617029,"uid":31320,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T15:20:45.000Z","msg":"10.3 十八區開花<br />\n10.4 十八區開花<br />\n10.5 十八區開花<br />\n10.6 十八區開花<br />\n10.7 十八區開花<br />\n10.8 十八區開花<br />\n10.9 十八區開花<br />\n10.10 十八區開花<br />\n10.11 十八區開花<br />\n10.12 十八區開花<br />\n10.13 十八區開花<br />\n10.14 十八區開花<br />\n10.15 十八區開花<br />\n10.16 十八區開花<br />\n10.17 十八區開花<br />\n10.18 十八區開花<br />\n10.19 十八區開花<br />\n10.20 十八區開花<br />\n10.21 十八區開花<br />\n10.22 十八區開花<br />\n10.23 十八區開花<br />\n10.24 十八區開花<br />\n10.25 十八區開花<br />\n10.26 十八區開花<br />\n10.27 十八區開花<br />\n10.28 十八區開花<br />\n10.29 十八區開花<br />\n10.30 十八區開花<br />\n10.31 十八區開花<br />\n－十月完－"},{"pid":"a8e395b55771dc8eca05a7b96ac092b9cd77b26c","tid":1617029,"uid":194325,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-03T15:20:54.000Z","msg":"#請廣傳 <br />\n<br />\n香港人俾政府恰到上心口！<br />\n「反蒙面法」有機會聽日立埋<br />\n如果你連三罷公投都唔表態<br />\n你 註定輸一世！<br />\n<br />\n公投截止日期：10月11日中午12點<br />\n<br />\nThe Government treat all HongKongers as nothing and they also want to pass the anti-mask law to tackle protesters.<br />\nIt is time for us to speak up!
