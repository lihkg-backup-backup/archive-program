He is one of the first ethnic minority registered social workers in Hong Kong and was awarded by the Secretary for Home Affairs' Commendation Scheme in 2016 in recognition of his dedicated service and outstanding contributions to the enhancement of racial harmony and integration. In 2019, he received the Cathay ChangeMaker Award in recognition of his commitment to supporting minority groups and his contribution in advocating inclusion and racial harmony. His participation in the primaries is reflective of his commitment to Hong Kong and to serve Hong Kong people.
