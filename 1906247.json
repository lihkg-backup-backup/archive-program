For me, I usually tell my hairdresser to shave my hair at the sides and gel my hair on top. At home, I use clay and move my fingers towards the back of my hair while I ser them erect at the same time. As I do so, I clench my fingers around my hair for the hair to settle while lifting my strands up. I also use a spray to hold it up afterwards. Do you prefer indoor or outdoor pursuits? You have lots of opportunities for leisure pursuits. How do you usually prepare veggies? For me, I usually plug the drain in the kitchen sink (the plughole) and fill the sink with water. Then soak the vegetables for fifteen minutes. Rinse them with water afterwards. If you want to cook with green peppers you can leave diced green peppers to soak overnight or soak them in red wine for ten minutes. If you accidentally spill red wine on your shirt you can usually soak out the red wine stain by leaving your shirt in water. In years past, only the aristocrats were entitled to learn to play the piano and the violin. Unlike the past, pianists and violinists are thick on the ground today. My friend Joyce is a very kind and thoughtful lady. Good women like her are thin on the ground. She asked me whether if could teach her a magic trick. I then said &quot;what's it worth?&quot; If you can't swim you're in good conpany. Tom failed the driving test on the first try too so you're in good company. Joyce has many calluses on her hands and feet. She should get a scrub and exfoliate her hands and feet so that she can completely get rid of the calluses. Alternatively, she can go to a nail salon and remove the calluses. If you wanna empty the trash on your computer, right-click the trash in the bottom right hand corner of the screen and empty it. If you wanna check out the properties of your computer click the apple icon in the top left hand corner of the screen. I used to live in osaka. I still remember my maid taking me to trick or treat as a kid but after we had moved to where I now live we didn't go trick or treating anymore because it isn't popular in here. I need to be in Shinjuku at five of nine tomorrow morning but I'm not sure if I could face getting up early enough to catch the plane that will get me to Shinjuku at twenty five of nine. Should I take a bus instead? I would appreciate any help you could offer."},{"pid":"68babf12384d7bda0227cf49c1df469991ac2040","tid":1906247,"uid":21646,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"quote":{"pid":"d11f5bbe10f3fe2f5e49eaa7b044e4685ed5fb4f","tid":1906247,"uid":78429,"like":12,"dislike":0,"score":12,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-03-01T21:31:14.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/8nVNTTa.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2F8nVNTTa.jpg&h=ed5c63dc&s={SIZE}\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-07T12:19:56.000Z","msg":"唔想救<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/donno.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
