I'd like to see Hong Kong worked out in a very humanitarian fashion. I hope President Xi can do it. He sure has the ability, I can tell you that, from personal knowledge. He certainly has the ability to do it if he wants to. So, I'd like to see that worked out in a humanitarian fashion.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>華為:</em></strong><br />\nQuestion:<br />\nOn Huawei -- is the administration going to allow U.S. businesses to continue selling to Huawei? Is there going to be an extension of the license tomorrow?<br />\n<br />\nTrump:<br />\nNo. That was reported. And, actually, it's the opposite. Huawei. Huawei is a company we may not do business with at all. And it was sort of reported, I think the opposite, today -- I was surprised -- that we are open to doing business. We're actually open not to doing business with them. So I don't know who gave the report.<br />\nNow, they have little sections of Huawei, like furniture and other things that we could do. But when you cut out sections, it gets very complicated: what's being sold, what's coming in. So, at this moment, it looks much more like we're not going to do business. I don't want to do business at all, because it is a national security threat.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>香港:</em></strong><br />\nQuestion:<br />\nDid you watch any of the coverage of the Hong Kong protest? Huge numbers of people.<br />\n<br />\nTrump:<br />\nI can't believe it. You know, I tell you, I've never seen 2 million people. When you talk about crowd size, Maggie, those are serious crowds -- the Hong Kong crowds. I mean, when they said 2 million people on the streets, that really looked like 2 million people on the streets"},{"pid":"f9b1ba86744b75dd5363e54933fe2c26ee1c5c2c","tid":1486656,"uid":209543,"like":4,"dislike":0,"score":4,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-19T02:54:09.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"13678d3b20b4f143c21e07082f22b4ae49737b44","tid":1486656,"uid":51271,"like":8,"dislike":0,"score":8,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-19T02:54:25.000Z","msg":"記者:<br />\nWhat changed your mind, sir?

And why have you moved?<br />\n<br />\nTrump:<br />\nNo, I think it would be very hard to deal if they do violence. I mean, if it's another Tiananmen Square, it's -- I think it's a very hard thing to do if there's violence. And, you know, that -- I'm President, but that's a little beyond me because I think there'd be -- you know, I think there'd be tremendous political sentiment not to do something.<br />\n<br />\nSo I hope -- because I think we're going to end up doing a very good deal. And I think China, by the way, needs a deal much more than we do. But I really do believe that if this weren't part of the deal, possibly something would have happened already a long time ago<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n記者:<br />\nDo you support the principles of the protestors -- the pro-democracy movement?<br />\n<br />\nTrump:<br />\nThat's -- that's what I'm asking.<br />\n<br />\n記者:<br />\nDo you think democracy matters?<br />\n<br />\nTrump:<br />\nWell, I'll tell you what I do support: I support liberty. I support democracy. I understand what's going on very well over there. I'd love to see it worked out in a humane fashion. And I think they have a great chance of doing it. Look, I put out -- and I told you that I really believe -- I have a confidence in the -- in the talents of President Xi.
