Thousands of Hong Kongers have been arrested, assaulted, tear-gassed and even shot with live-rounds simply for wearing black in public, or for arbitrarily judged as associated with protestors dressed in black. Just this Monday (11/11), a police officer pointed his gun at an unarmed protestor who showed no signs of aggression, and then shot live round at two other unarmed protestors. In the same morning, the police force has also marched into universities on the ridiculous ground that students are illegally assembling on campus.<br />\n<br />\nJoin us on 11/13 your local time and wear black to stand in solidarity with Hong Kongers - for the souls lost, and for those of us who are still fighting for freedom and democracy.
