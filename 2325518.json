That&rsquo;s more than 40,000 vehicles over its last quarterly delivery record.<br />\n<br />\nIn order to achieve this massive increase in volume, Tesla has extended the period for shipments to other markets from Fremont factory later into the quarter, and it is now counting a quick production ramp to deliver more brand new vehicles quickly in California and other regions with short transit times at the end of the quarter.<br />\n<br />\nIn California, Tesla benefits from a new $1,500 EV incentive introduced last month.<br />\n<br />\nWe will know if the strategy paid off during the first week of January, when Tesla releases its Q4 production and delivery numbers."},{"pid":"f7943ececa6b9c6d83f7535f15009cf6e2996f84","tid":2325518,"uid":295230,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-14T15:43:59.000Z","msg":"Model S同Model X本季既產能目標已達成，Model 3既產能需求遠超預期<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/touch.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/touch.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/touch.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d8cb23379be85856de4281155c9fe2d19d76fdc4","tid":2325518,"uid":295230,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-14T15:44:22.000Z","msg":"錯台<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/23.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/23.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}],"pinned":{"pid":"d8cb23379be85856de4281155c9fe2d19d76fdc4","tid":2325518,"uid":295230,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-12-14T15:44:22.000Z","msg":"錯台<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/23.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/23.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}}
