CNN was not present at the briefing, but the US Treasury Department confirmed her comments.<br />\nMandelker said she relayed her concerns in meetings with city officials.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;We have also stressed here in Hong Kong the importance of having the appropriate mechanism in place to enforce UN Security Council resolutions and other regulations prohibiting activities that facilitate financial transactions with North Korea,&quot; she said.<br />\n<br />\nWhen asked about Mandelker's comments, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government said the city &quot;strictly implements the sanction measures decided by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and has been staying highly vigilant about activities and suspected cases that may violate UNSC sanctions.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nHong Kong is governed as a special administrative region of China and operates under its own set of laws and regulations when it comes to the financial and shipping industries.<br />\nThe city's lax regulations when it comes to company registration and reporting requirements -- a legacy of British colonial rule, analysts say -- make it an attractive place to do business but easy for bad actors like North Korea to engage in illicit activities.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Hong Kong, of course, is an international financial hub and at the same time it has company formation and registration rules that we think need to be stronger,&quot; Mandelker said.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/25/asia/hong-kong-north-korea-money-intl/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fedition.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F25%2Fasia%2Fhong-kong-north-korea-money-intl%2F&d=Q%2FfuHUrffkCmMTVCp%2FMfQwtTNu1qqkxUxYmVHECffP4%3D&h=df366a4b\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=http%3A%2F%2Fedition.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F25%2Fasia%2Fhong-kong-north-korea-money-intl%2F&h=396355d1\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/25/asia/hong-kong-north-korea-money-intl/</a>"},{"pid":"5526dd7340ed8046d6a2fb8f0c17c8698aae47ca","tid":540196,"uid":11001,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-25T09:15:41.000Z","msg":"英文冇人理 <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d8f1c0125de4b041e235869babbf6d5ed792b450","tid":540196,"uid":13724,"like":1,"dislike":1,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-25T09:27:54.000Z","msg":"辣興咗美國佬，關係法<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/bye.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 近了"},{"pid":"9ed96d402d2c89f0b221f1d71b5d6cc38ac78e85","tid":540196,"uid":24140,"like":3,"dislike":0,"score":3,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-25T09:33:26.000Z","msg":"呢個時候香港人變左唔係支那人<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0504561e103b34d2c42198c0b3697a78220cd3a4","tid":540196,"uid":10064,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-25T09:50:03.000Z","msg":"港共政府實話冇"},{"pid":"b9eaf26a0312fe861d9f09b6b943ba90f43c0a23","tid":540196,"uid":75326,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-25T09:54:47.000Z","msg":"呢啲咪係上面嘅真正一國兩制囉<br />\n美國佬2018先知? 遲唔遲咗啲?<br />\n特首快快趣加油，閙鳩佢說三道四!<br />\n閙鳩埋班白鬼一邊賺人仔一邊講民主正義<br />\n做雞要拎貞節牌坊? 冇香港你賺到人仔?<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"2d0cff4692e416cd2040eb89fd2025635d4303cf","tid":540196,"uid":87780,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-25T09:56:55.000Z","msg":"快啲取消香港關係法啦<br />\n反正班睪官成日叫人面向祖國<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/369.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1e11e7f503f224d25dfcf24941d483e9f4c50b26","tid":540196,"uid":49392,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-25T09:59:05.000Z","msg":"亞視都死完又翻生，捨得廢香港關係法未"},{"pid":"acaa9bdf8b129acfe155b348662253c6065613f6","tid":540196,"uid":6604,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-25T09:59:15.000Z","msg":"美帝可唔可以開條逃生門畀一啲支持自由開放民主嘅香港人<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c76ec1c330b8aa47f6d509d8db1ce92bb1b6a2d2","tid":540196,"uid":60545,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-01-25T10:00:39.000Z","msg":"取消香港關係法，香港經濟會崩潰"}]}
