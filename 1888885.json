A new U.S. peace plan, unveiled by President Donald Trump last month, envisaged Israel keeping East Jerusalem and swathes of West Bank land, and was rejected by the Palestinians.<br />\n<br />\n(Reporting by Mustafa Abu Ganeyeh; Writing by Rami Ayyub; Editing by Giles Elgood)"},{"pid":"160d0d3dd8d46f3e6bfab8cfbdc7f06b79730a8f","tid":1888885,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-20T12:48:57.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"954a0fabfefdb08c15526294c1968b91b263ef46","tid":1888885,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-20T12:51:35.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"cbce84a55a2cf0c228d9a005cf2b5437a40eef20","tid":1888885,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-20T12:57:11.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1f64b093af17e41a0480453b5bc5736d6fa535f9","tid":1888885,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-20T13:06:41.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"b4553fe409197df44ca0e8d57e9a0605d2e84eb1","tid":1888885,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-20T13:13:47.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"df04fa284661604b718a1bc0b54187a28504da72","tid":1888885,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-20T13:58:25.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
