In an interview with KABC Radio, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the reward money has reached $175,000, after two individuals donated $75,000 to add to the $100,000 offered by the county.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"red\">&quot;This challenge is to Lebron James. I want you to match that and double that reward,&quot;</span> Villanueva said. &quot;I know you care about law enforcement.<span class=\"red\"> You expressed a very interesting statement</span> about your perspective on race relations and on officer-involved shootings and the impact that it has on the African-American community. And I appreciated that. But likewise, <span class=\"red\">we need to appreciate that respect for life goes across professions, across races, creeds</span>, and I'd like to see LeBron James step up to the plate and double that.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"red\">James</span>, who has been vocal about police shootings involving Black people, <span class=\"red\">had not publicly responded to the sheriff's challenge</span> as of early Tuesday morning. Last month, James expressed outrage after an officer shot Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, saying that Black people in America are &quot;terrified.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I know people get tired of hearing me say it but we are scared as a Black people in America,&quot; he said. <span class=\"red\">&quot;Black men, Black women, Black kids, we are terrified.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\nJames has also repeatedly called for justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT who was shot and killed when officers entered her apartment with a no-knock warrant in March.<br />\n<br />\nVillanueva's challenge to James came after the weekend ambush of two deputies who were in their parked police vehicle when a man walked up to the passenger's side and fired multiple rounds. The deputies were struck in the head and critically wounded but both are expected to recover, Villanueva said. The gunman hasn't been captured and a motive has not been determined.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n全文:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/la-sheriff-challenges-lebron-james-reward-money-ambushed-deputies/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fla-sheriff-challenges-lebron-james-reward-money-ambushed-deputies%2F&d=ulKCtXgG4rwmRR8qyGKIuSF8jviwHHlsaTD6zKFHFMM%3D&h=70793d2e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/la-sheriff-challenges-lebron-james-reward-money-ambushed-deputies/</a>"},{"pid":"4f4b6c3f11c14a38209d75acf973d8f410553fd3","tid":2203686,"uid":270889,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-15T13:31:50.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1305842455171002368?s=20\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FCBSNews%2Fstatus%2F1305842455171002368%3Fs%3D20&d=ulKCtXgG4rwmRR8qyGKIuSF8jviwHHlsaTD6zKFHFMM%3D&h=54e65134\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FCBSNews%2Fstatus%2F1305842455171002368%3Fs%3D20&h=849cd90a\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1305842455171002368?s=20</a>"},{"pid":"9e4013643c8faf228e715e385fd591752e28bdd0","tid":2203686,"uid":270889,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-15T13:33:50.000Z","msg":"上面提及嘅警員被埋伏事件<br />\n<br />\n[美國] 兩名加州警身中多槍 情況危殆 凶手仍然在逃<br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/gcbddS\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/gcbddS</a>"},{"pid":"2381b3b93fad2d7cc627c9e9091e097a15908831","tid":2203686,"uid":78470,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-09-15T13:35:27.000Z","msg":"無光環不了"},{"pid":"f9620f706dc4dd72489717c1286bd8b2832d2296","tid":2203686,"uid":270889,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"2381b3b93fad2d7cc627c9e9091e097a15908831","tid":2203686,"uid":78470,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-09-15T13:35:27.000Z","msg":"無光環不了"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-15T13:38:52.000Z","msg":"comment一面倒屌緊個警察<br />\n(不過係CBS)"},{"pid":"b7b397719fc66b05eda0648b710600c409446695","tid":2203686,"uid":55913,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-15T13:49:00.000Z","msg":"左膠好小氣ga"},{"pid":"e314f0a392fa4ceae13c6221727246ffa6b97af0","tid":2203686,"uid":95520,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-15T13:49:49.000Z","msg":"食屎啦占士"}]}
