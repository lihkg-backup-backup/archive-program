While public investments traded as early as 1792 in the U.S., initially they were mostly bonds or banks backed by the government. The Dow Jones industrial average wasn't published until 1896. Return data before that had to be recreated with the help of another research organization.<br />\n<br />\nSecond, while the stock market does at times match the &quot;social mood&quot; of the country, that seems far from the case right now. A recent Gallup poll found that only 14% of Americans were happy with the direction of the country, despite the market being up 32% in the past three years.<br />\n<br />\nIndeed, a number of top stock market strategists have recently said they believe the recent increase in the stock market is signaling a win for Joe Biden, not Mr. Trump. Goldman Sachs, for instance, told clients in a research note last week that the odds of Biden winning the presidency and Democrats gaining a majority in the Senate was roughly 65%. Analysts with the investment bank pointed out that stock prices have been rising since September, coinciding with political polls tilting increasingly toward Biden.<br />\n<br />\nWhat's more, the Socionomics researchers found that the market is more reliable in predicting elections when the gains are across a number of sectors, and not concentrated in a single sector, like tech, as they are now. For instance, when George H.W. Bush lost, the average stock in the broad market was actually down 11% during the prior three years, even though the Dow, which only tracks 30 major stocks, was up in the same time.<br />\n<br />\nThe same is true of the market under Mr. Trump. While the Dow and the S&amp;P 500, each of which tracks a fraction of the stock market, are both up, the average price of all publicly traded stocks has fallen 10% in the past three years.<br />\n<br />\nThe Socionomic Institute itself is headed by market strategist Robert Prechter, who is credited with calling the bull market of the 1980s, but has been less successful since. In 2010, Prechter told the New York Times the Dow was poised to have a plunge of epic proportions, falling from its near 10,000 level at the time to a mere 1,000 over the next six years. Instead, by 2016, the Dow had nearly doubled, rising to just over 18,000."},{"pid":"d12fd3a49b6ad0680da6f7b51d77d195e9ac0d49","tid":2256046,"uid":105176,"like":1,"dislike":2,"score":-1,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2020-10-24T05:03:07.000Z","msg":"靜靜地贏唔得既"},{"pid":"08794f679b308e747c1f2553a3be048a9b09bcac","tid":2256046,"uid":28114,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-10-24T05:03:22.000Z","msg":"Still, Socionomics' Lampert says the stock market numbers are in Mr. Trump's favor.
