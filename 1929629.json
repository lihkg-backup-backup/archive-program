He then followed up by tweeting a report from a conspiracy website, stating that it provided &ldquo;further evidence that the virus originated in the US.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThere are no words to describe the absurdity of the accusation, but for those who monitor China&rsquo;s ruling regime it comes as no surprise. Deflection and blame are par for the course, but what is surprising is how many in the United States media are inadvertently carrying water for Beijing.<br />\n<br />\nJust take the hysteria over basic facts like the virus&rsquo;s origins. Just a month ago, the New York Times regularly referred to it as the &ldquo;Wuhan coronavirus,&rdquo; as did the Associated Press, CNN, and others. A Foreign Policy editor, whom no one could reasonably accuse of insensitivity, referred to it as the &ldquo;Wuhan virus&rdquo; all the while warning &ldquo;prejudices can fuel fear and racism&rdquo; against the Chinese people. A month ago, no one thought twice because geographic elements were common parts of disease names; think Ebola, the Hong Kong flu, or the West Nile virus.<br />\n......<br />\n<br />\nXi Jinping is using state-directed media outlets to do more than blame America; he is orchestrating a campaign of disinformation across the globe and leveraging his nation&rsquo;s economic and military heft to ensure other countries fall in line with the CCP&rsquo;s messaging. He has done so since the virus&rsquo;s initial outbreak, refusing to share vital information about its transmission, lethality, and other data &mdash; depriving other nations the opportunity to prepare for its inevitable spread in the process. Yet, some Western media outlets continue to insist China&rsquo;s actions &ldquo;bought America time&rdquo; &ndash; a headline ripped straight from Beijing&rsquo;s state-run media.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/16/exclusive-marco-rubio-chinas-shameless-coronavirus-pandemic-propaganda-campaign/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fasia%2F2020%2F03%2F16%2Fexclusive-marco-rubio-chinas-shameless-coronavirus-pandemic-propaganda-campaign%2F&d=AC0Zr9jWFF2OJ189utQw8DY9GQwUZQLLS4G4eGYLUm4%3D&h=6561bffd\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/16/exclusive-marco-rubio-chinas-shameless-coronavirus-pandemic-propaganda-campaign/</a>"},{"pid":"e7acf79b922a151e75488ffc705a5c2855954a26","tid":1929629,"uid":51701,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-17T09:19:22.000Z","msg":"Rubio<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"6062e1941387cdc16901150a2187635235ce6e6a","tid":1929629,"uid":49575,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-17T11:13:36.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/3aao2F5.gif\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2F3aao2F5.gif&h=44c6602c&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"bd65d282d347270cf88e15e64831acd0a9f60498","tid":1929629,"uid":19557,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-03-17T11:14:10.000Z","msg":"推"}]}
