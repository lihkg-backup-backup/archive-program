If I&rsquo;m not in it, it&rsquo;s a dream.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThere you have it, Inception fans. Since Caine is in the final scene, it&rsquo;s reality. Case closed. The totem falls.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n簡單總結：路蘭同堅爺講，只要場戲有你份，個場戲就係現實而唔係夢景。<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0d9f74d6c5a780d24b339f4e8d0b50b9b7db49ce","tid":781789,"uid":37759,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-08-16T07:48:39.000Z","msg":"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPy88-E2zo\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXQPy88-E2zo&d=ubJnKnfXtmxWHTX37MQb3e9M5Ue6CDmcYDZznX2R1Ws%3D&h=1a3d0452\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPy88-E2zo</a>"},{"pid":"13fd12d6ab392e9cf322ec72ead246345d9265c6","tid":781789,"uid":41317,"like":2,"dislike":1,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-08-16T08:01:09.000Z","msg":"唔係一早拆解左個陀螺唔係里安納度個totem咩<br />\n個陀螺totem係佢老婆, 而用人地個totem係冇效<br />\n里安納度個totem係佢自己隻戒指"},{"pid":"ff636b7859f832566b2ff2f3f2870db6e7b88d1c","tid":781789,"uid":32527,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-08-16T13:16:57.000Z","msg":"好多之前唔係已經有條片最後個陀螺跌左咩"}]}
