Bill Clinton Adviser: Country Doesn't 'Give a Damn' About Stormy Daniels<br />\n<br />\nA former adviser to President Bill Clinton, Dick Morris, predicted Republicans will overwhelmingly win during the midterms because Democrats are focused on issues that aren't a voting factor to most of the country. <br />\n<br />\nDuring an interview on &ldquo;The Cats Roundtable,&rdquo; Morris explained that in the 1990s when he worked for Clinton, Republicans thought they had a &ldquo;gold mine&rdquo; when the Monica Lewinsky scandal came out.<br />\n<br />\nWhile Republicans only talked about impeachment and the scandal, when election time came, Democrats gained seats, which is what he predicts will happen come midterms. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The Democrats who are attacking [President Donald] Trump think that they have a panacea in the Stormy Daniels scandal and the possibility of impeachment, and that's all they're talking about,&rdquo; he explained.<br />\n<br />\nMorris narrowed in on the topics of Daniels, Trump attorney Michael Cohen, and Russia as Democratic talking points and contrasted it with the Republicans' focus. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The Republicans and Trump are talking about jobs and terrorism and Korea and Iran,&rdquo; he told radio host John Catsimatidis.<br />\n<br />\nHe pointed out that as a whole, Republicans have seen a steady rise in approval ratings while Democrats have been steadily dropping. Morris said Trump's approval rating since the scandal has gone from 40 percent to 45 percent. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The same sort of fool's gold that deceived the Republicans in '98 is now luring the Democrats into making the same mistake this year,&rdquo; the former Clinton adviser warned. <br />\n<br />\nMorris cautioned the Democrats of putting everything into the scandal because &ldquo;the country doesn't give a damn.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nHe told Catsimatidis that unlike his alleged affair with Daniels, Americans care about Trump's success with North Korea and ISIS.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;There is no blue wave coming,&rdquo; Morris concluded. &ldquo;There's a red wave, and what makes it red is the blood of the Democratic Party.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"26a4455a48ceeccb90a624c357fff99ee36dbeb6","tid":668538,"uid":31637,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"61fe2934466927eccbdbef1f55e7f80fdd0e617a","tid":668538,"uid":29167,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-05-17T16:57:57.000Z","msg":"用桃色醜聞攻擊侵係邊個智將諗出嚟？"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-05-17T17:00:53.000Z","msg":"屌, 跟本冇位入,咪同香港D濕鳩政黨一撚樣, 唔係陰謀論屈鬼攻擊就係黑材料醜聞攻擊架啦, 反共都比佢地吹撚到奶共"},{"pid":"b2e495dfb4afa63a916ebe80ec3720af3a2dcb19","tid":668538,"uid":4783,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"26a4455a48ceeccb90a624c357fff99ee36dbeb6","tid":668538,"uid":31637,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"61fe2934466927eccbdbef1f55e7f80fdd0e617a","tid":668538,"uid":29167,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-05-17T16:57:57.000Z","msg":"用桃色醜聞攻擊侵係邊個智將諗出嚟？"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-05-17T17:00:53.000Z","msg":"屌, 跟本冇位入,咪同香港D濕鳩政黨一撚樣, 唔係陰謀論屈鬼攻擊就係黑材料醜聞攻擊架啦, 反共都比佢地吹撚到奶共"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-05-17T17:06:23.000Z","msg":"問題在於，侵侵係有錢佬<br />\n叫雞有咩出奇<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n佢又唔係呀BILL咁出軌<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
