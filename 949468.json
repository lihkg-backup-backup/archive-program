/>\n民主共和兩黨將發文件　啟動檢討港政策法<br />\n<br />\n【本報訊】早前訪美的公民黨郭榮鏗曾透露，若香港再發生如剝奪參選權等五種情況，美將取消《美國－－香港政策法》或稱《香港政策法》及獨立關稅地位，他昨接受訪問時披露更多內容。郭直言美民主、共和兩黨已有共識，將發出文件詳述關注香港哪些問題，以及何時會重新檢視《美國－－香港政策法》，形容美方已有具體計劃並按部就班啟動，對香港是一大警號。他已向美方表明取消《政策法》會傷害香港，但美取態取決於港府，「（港府）繼續去畀人覺得根本上其實一國兩制係有名無實，個後果就喺度」。<br />\n<br />\n郭榮鏗昨接受電台訪問總結訪美之行，指《政策法》與一國兩制表現掛鈎，「如果你根本上係一國一制嘅，或者你口講一國兩制、其實實際上係一國一制，咁我點解要畀個特別關稅區？」<span style=\"color: red;\">又指《政策法》容許美元與港元自由兌換，這與香港將港元與美元掛鈎息息相關，一旦美國取消《政策法》，「我哋香港就唔可以同美金掛鈎，呢個後果我相信大家都諗到，對我哋國際金融中心嘅地位係點」。</span><br />\n<br />\n表明希望不要取消<br />\n<br />\n他理解美方「唔可以無條件咁延續（政策法）落去」，因為「一國兩制係繼續咁樣差落去，或者係畀人個感覺係你完全都唔顧及呢啲法治、民主、自由嘅，而同時間你係做緊白手套，從美方嘅角度去睇，咁我點解仲要當你係唔同呢？」但強調已向美方表明不要取消《政策法》，否則等如把香港「最基本嘅國際社會地位都取消埋」，受傷害的只會是港人。<br />\n<br />\n郭榮鏗之後再回覆《蘋果》時稱，他訪美見過民主、共和兩黨國會中，對外交及對華政策有深入研究人士，亦見過華爾街大型金融機構人士，他們雖表明希望繼續在港投資，但也關注香港情況。更重要的是，郭理解民主、共和兩黨已有共識，在不久將來會發出文件，講述兩黨具體關注香港哪些問題，並會講明一旦出現哪些情況，又或到那些關鍵時候，即會重新檢視《政策法》。他認為美方要改變《政策法》固然不能輕率，但對方明顯已有計劃按部就班處理，這對港無疑是一大警號。<br />\n<br />\n早前亦曾訪美的民主黨涂謹申也不建議美國取消《政策法》，因對香港是災難，亦無助推動香港民主運動。但他表示取消與否主導權在美國，從港府推動民主的工作看「港府梗係做得唔好，唔好到一個程度可能會令人焗住要取消」。<br />\n<br />\n自由黨黨魁鍾國斌覺得，若郭所言屬實將是很大問題，他早已提醒政府不要對美國會委員會報告建議重檢香港獨立關稅區地位掉以輕心，要多做游說、解釋工作，他希望隨着早前總理李克強會見林鄭時提到香港獨立關稅區地位後，港府能再着緊些及處理得更好。<br
