Im counting down the days until i holiday there. Can't wait ! For Tokyo, a dazzling sun has been forecast for the whole month. In Osaka, there's been a long spell of dry hot weather while in Kyoto there's been a long spell of wet cold weather. In Hiroshima, the weather forecast is for a hot and sunny day and a warm and breezy night tomorrow, just right for swimming. In Hong Kong, the weather forecast is for sunny spells and scattered showers the whole week. For Kagoshima, light rain has been forecast for tomorrow whereas for Miyazaki, a hailstorm and light snowfalls have been predicted. For Fukuoka, a sunny and breezy day has been predicted just right for sailing while for Hokkaido, heavy rainfall and scattered hail showers have been forecast. In Okinawa, the weather forecast said there would be dry sunny spells today. It also stated it was going to be hot and sunny tomorrow. Of course, sleet showers and snow showers are much better than thundery showers and wintry showers. In Tokyo, we had fog and drizzle earlier but now it's sleeting. Yesterday I forgot to bring my umbrella and raincoat so I got caught in a sleet shower while touring the tourist attractions there and a snow shower on my way to the hotel."},{"pid":"72c53c6152fe35d46a443d5f361758476c3d39af","tid":1515837,"uid":256585,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T09:44:10.000Z","msg":"今日呀"},{"pid":"c30b841bae44adc3b8392f6616acbf19ab9c282d","tid":1515837,"uid":139917,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"65fdc8913815e9975e123e55489728ca06505c6b","tid":1515837,"uid":241171,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-08-29T10:30:46.000Z","msg":"有無手足下星期去日本箱根?<br />\n<br />\n我自己一個去放鬆下，有緣既一齊食過飯"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-04T11:14:44.000Z","msg":"大涌谷關左好可惜 其實冇左呢個景點其他野好似冇特別？温泉就好多地方都有得浸 河口湖都得？<br />\n我兩度都未去過..黎緊去.不過如果陰天..咩湖都唔好睇睇<br />\nHappi trip anyway!"}]}
