The use of PT drivers has been in existence in HK for over 40 years since I was at CMB and did occasional PT driving myself. I am unaware of evidence they are more accident prone than their FT colleagues. Indeed, some PT drivers have been driving buses for so many years, they are probably more experienced than their newer FT colleagues. The other three franchised bus companies with a driver shortage, will undoubtedly benefit from this unexpected windfall of PT drivers during the CNY holidays when the rate of FT absenteeism can reach serious levels with many cancelled bus journeys.<br />\n<br />\nAs for the recent unfortunate accident, the issue is not whether the driver was an FT or a PT driver but, what was it that caused the driver to behave in the way he so calamitously did. Something very serious must have happened to cause him &lsquo;to snap&rsquo; and do what he did. This must be rooted out. Surely, whatever it was could have affected any human being and, his status as a PT driver is irrelevant. However, we cannot forgive him for his actions.<br />\n<br />\nDouble deck buses when driven appropriately are entirely safe and stable. Indeed, each new bus type must pass a stability test by being successfully tilted to 28 degrees without toppling over and with the top deck only loaded with water containers simulating the weight of the full seating capacity. In normal circumstances the modern low-floor, low-centre-of-gravity double deck buses with a fully distributed passenger load, are extremely difficult to capsize. It is only when a bus makes contact with a solid object at speed that the momentum will cause it to capsize.<br />\n<br />\nInstead of giving the impression of doubt about the suitability for employment of certain PT drivers, a more sensible attitude would have been to comfort the traveling public about their good record. Otherwise, how can the public now be convinced otherwise in the event of their being reinstated in a few months ?"},{"pid":"3c9649af2806efe6a37678e586af49462a05ec5d","tid":562896,"uid":82917,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-16T10:54:33.000Z","msg":"好多英文<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 睇5明牙"},{"pid":"8fe438f5a6992318fc3012dd2d81dfcf2a249566","tid":562896,"uid":62445,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"3c9649af2806efe6a37678e586af49462a05ec5d","tid":562896,"uid":82917,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-16T10:54:33.000Z","msg":"好多英文<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 睇5明牙"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-16T11:12:15.000Z","msg":"Google translate"},{"pid":"6c2d0a907099da9ce2a50792f293fa35df0deffb","tid":562896,"uid":80294,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"quote":{"pid":"8fe438f5a6992318fc3012dd2d81dfcf2a249566","tid":562896,"uid":62445,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"3c9649af2806efe6a37678e586af49462a05ec5d","tid":562896,"uid":82917,"like":0,"dislike":3,"score":-3,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-16T10:54:33.000Z","msg":"好多英文<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> 睇5明牙"},"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2018-02-16T11:12:15.000Z","msg":"Google translate"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-02-16T12:11:12.000Z","msg":"識咁多字 個腦會唔會爆炸架<img src=\"/assets/faces/lny/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"48a194bad264869afd248338153b550a7c8bbb2a","tid":562896,"uid":149877,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-02-16T12:15:56.000Z","msg":"打得英文個篇 條友起碼講出個問題出來<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
