Even I can leave for the States anytime, I would rather die in this city. <br />\n<br />\nAmerica fought in World War II against evil tyrants who wished to enslave the entire world.  For years we stand for freedom and democracy, as the leader of the free world, I believe that it is our obligation to continue to support those who fight for freedom and democracy, in this case Hong Kong.<br />\n<br />\nAs Winston Churchill addressed the British Parliament in the 1940, &ldquo;we shall defend our  island, whatever the cost may be.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nThe American Congress is working on a bill called &ldquo;Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act&rdquo;, which I believe will make sure the Chinese and Hong Kong Communist governments not dare to contempt. <br />\n<br />\nHowever, this Act will not provide a swift ending to this power struggle. So, I beg my fellow Hong Kongers with good conscious that we will continue the fight until the victory is ours. I hope you all hold tight to our value, our cause and our believes to bring this tyrannical government and this corrupted system to justice. <br />\n<br />\nAs President Abraham Lincoln said during the Gettysburg Address in 1863, &ldquo;that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nIs the Hong Kong government doing its job now? <br />\n<br />\nWhen a government does not represent its people, here is my words to it and its leader: it is your intention to push Hong Kong over the cliff into the abyss, do NOT frame true Hong Kongers for your fault. How dare you sold Hong Kong out! Carrie Lam, be prepared to suffer eternal damnation!<br />\n<br />\nSucceed may not come in a brink of the eyes, but it is the courage to continue that counts. Therefore, courage and hope are our biggest ammunitions. Courage to carry on, hope for freedom and democracy. <br />\n<br />\nAmerica, support Hong Kongers as much as you can. Hong Kong, keep calm, be rational and carry on. We shall never surrender. <br />\n<br />\nMay God bless you, may God bless Hong Kong, may God bless the Untied states of America. <br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span style=\"color: gold;\">光復香港 時代革命<br />\n五大訴求 缺一不可</span></span>"},{"pid":"4fa2f60c7c65adc45db5fffdccf3170702630795","tid":1549746,"uid":123991,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T12:21:42.000Z","msg":"<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong><div style=\"text-align: center;\">出黎呀，自由閪！</div></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color: red;\"><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong>不闖入、不塗鴉、不鐳射</strong></span></span><br />\n如有發現，批淮大家往死裡打 <img src=\"/assets/faces/pig/drum.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">明日之公眾集會(遮打花園)及公眾遊行(前往美領)已獲發不反對通知書。</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n集會部分<br />\n地點：中環遮打花園<br />\n時間：13:30 - 18:30<br />\n四節主題：時代子民、獄中讚歌、審判將至、天佑美國<br />\n<br />\n※※ 遮打現場將收集香港人權與民主宣言聯署至14:30﹐隨後出發向美領遞交 ※※<br />\n<br />\n遊行部分<br />\n集合地點：中環遮打花園金鐘道出口<br />\n集合時間：14:30<br />\n遊行路線：遮打花園經花園道往下亞厘畢道巴士站公眾活動區，向美國領事館遞交請願信<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/ZY3Vs7C.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FZY3Vs7C.jpg&h=2d1d3d5a&s={SIZE}\" />"},{"pid":"7bab1b848ea13bd792f50d1edf8887459e042572","tid":1549746,"uid":249171,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T12:28:46.000Z","msg":"聽日各位加油，嚟到就領事館見面<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/good.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a6ffe6200532f1580624dd5cd032ca651087b8c1","tid":1549746,"uid":249171,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T12:35:05.000Z","msg":"From TG<br />\n<br />\n[#戰友建議]<br />\n(9/8) English Slogan<br />\n<br />\nLiberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times!<br />\n5 Demands, Not One Less!<br />\nStand With Hong Kong, Fight For Freedom! <br />\nTogether We Stand, Together We Can!"},{"pid":"3b5a77f9d4bff35f5fc7b5b08a024ca8c5d40619","tid":1549746,"uid":61766,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T12:47:06.000Z","msg":"有人要餓死啦<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/cry.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n《急推》 前線唔好餓死呀<br />\n<a href=\"https://lih.kg/1540938\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://lih.kg/1540938</a><br />\n- 分享自 LIHKG 討論區"},{"pid":"260e3b3dba533370cd092d449770b50866076421","tid":1549746,"uid":258370,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-09-07T12:47:46.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"}]}
