Hong Kong Police Force launched 10 hotlines for &lsquo;report of violence&rsquo; through Whatsapp on Sept 10. The hotlines only allow online conversations for collecting evidence and information regarding the social movement. It's criticized by citizens that the hotlines are the replication of &lsquo; criticize and judge&rsquo; during Cultural Revolution which is another kind of white terror. I have reason to believe that they have violated the terms of service of Whatsapp. Details are as follows.<br />\n<br />\nPersonal Account:<br />\nViolated the Terms of Service of WhatsApp as the account owner is using this account for &ldquo;non-personal use&rdquo;<br />\nBusiness Account:<br />\nInappropriate massive data collection of personal info without other users&rsquo; consensus<br />\n<br />\nAs the hotlines were switching between business account and personal account from time to time, they may have violated both regulations above.<br />\n<br />\nBelow are some evidence of the official announcement from HKPF.https://<a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-law-and-crime/article/2152375/hong-kong-police-launch-new-online-reporting\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Fnews%2Fhong-kong%2Fhong-kong-law-and-crime%2Farticle%2F2152375%2Fhong-kong-police-launch-new-online-reporting&d=fwl9YqZIxHA797AeyThx4erkGmmZttFFipzpmUasbQ8%3D&h=75ac7027\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-law-and-crime/article/2152375/hong-kong-police-launch-new-online-reporting</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_yqH3GAnL8\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0_yqH3GAnL8&d=fwl9YqZIxHA797AeyThx4erkGmmZttFFipzpmUasbQ8%3D&h=953d3d1d\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_yqH3GAnL8</a><br />\n<br />\nThese are the numbers HKPF used for the hotlines:5566 95005566 95015566 95025566 95035566 95045566 95055566 95065566 95075566 95085566 9509<br />\n<br />\nI know that Whatsapp has been enforcing on abusers of the platform.
