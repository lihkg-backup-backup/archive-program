Here are five claims that caught our attention during his CNN town hall in Moosic, Pa., moderated by Anderson Cooper.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"orange\"><em>&quot;If the president had done his job, had done his job from the beginning, all the people would still be alive. All the people &mdash; I&rsquo;m not making this up. Just look at the data. Look at the data.&rdquo;</em></span><br />\n<br />\nActually, <span class=\"red\">Biden is making this up. There is no data to support this</span>, even if the president had moved rapidly in January to deal with the coronavirus and been able to persuade the Chinese leadership to be more forthcoming about the situation. Even nations that have been praised for their handling of the pandemic, such as South Korea, New Zealand and Iceland, have suffered some deaths (377 in South Korea, 25 in New Zealand and 10 in Iceland).<br />\n<span class=\"brown\">老作 就算防疫再好嘅國家都避免唔到有人死</span><br />\n<br />\nIn the United States,<span class=\"red\"> with 50 states run by governors, policies have varied greatly</span>. Trump has been faulted for not articulating a national plan, but he <span class=\"red\">would have had trouble persuading every governor to follow</span> the exact same path.<br />\n<span class=\"brown\">美國50個州係由州長管理 當中政策各異<br />\n侵比人鬧得多係佢無做全國性計劃 就算有佢要州長聽佢枝笛其實都唔易</span><br />\n<br />\n<em><span class=\"orange\">&quot;When, back in January, I wrote an article for USA Today saying, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got a pandemic. We&rsquo;ve got a real problem.&rdquo;</span></em><br />\n<br />\nBiden<span class=\"red\"> overstates what he said in January</span>; he <span class=\"red\">did not flatly say it was a pandemic</span>.<br />\n<span class=\"brown\">誇張 佢根本無係一月講有大爆發</span><br />\n<br />\nThe USA Today piece is <span class=\"red\">more of an attack on Trump</span> and a recollection of Obama administration steps taken against the 2014 Ebola outbreak than a <span class=\"red\">detailed plan for action against a possible pandemic</span>. But at the same time, Biden indicated that he took the threat seriously, even if he did not explicitly say a pandemic was on the way.<br />\n<span class=\"brown\">主要係攻擊侵 講返obama點應付ebola  但biden自己都無講有咩措施防止大爆發</span><br />\n<span class=\"brown\"><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></span><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"orange\"><em>&ldquo;We should expect another 215,000 dead by January. But if we wore a mask, we&rsquo;d save 100,000 of those lives, doing nothing but that.&rdquo;</em></span><br />\n<br />\nThese numbers are on target. Deaths from the novel coronavirus are near 200,000 in the United States, and one influential group of researchers predicts the total will reach 415,000 by 2021. The projection comes from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. The IHME model currently forecasts 415,090 U.S. deaths by Jan. 1, 2021.<br />\n<br />\nThe institute&rsquo;s forecasts were influential earlier in the pandemic in guiding policies developed by the White House coronavirus task force, <span class=\"red\">but they have been criticized by some experts</span> as projecting further into the future than can be done reliably, The Washington Post reported.<br />\n<span class=\"brown\">呢到講嘅數字係有研究咁講  但個研究同時都有比好多專家批評</span><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dislike.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n全文仲有兩三個point 可以入去睇:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/17/joe-bidens-cnn-town-hall-an-occasional-whopper/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2F2020%2F09%2F17%2Fjoe-bidens-cnn-town-hall-an-occasional-whopper%2F&d=1nW%2FAbATR%2BcU2iH%2BEMdxEw2E5jpmEl9YQHmcT4noKO0%3D&h=37d9222c\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/17/joe-bidens-cnn-town-hall-an-occasional-whopper/</a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://unfoxnews.com/joe-bidens-cnn-town-hall-an-occasional-whopper/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Funfoxnews.com%2Fjoe-bidens-cnn-town-hall-an-occasional-whopper%2F&d=1nW%2FAbATR%2BcU2iH%2BEMdxEw2E5jpmEl9YQHmcT4noKO0%3D&h=08ea369e\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://unfoxnews.com/joe-bidens-cnn-town-hall-an-occasional-whopper/</a>"},{"pid":"d90e94f68b126058dfb24b174ac75d67a6320cc2","tid":2209038,"uid":25825,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-19T11:04:30.000Z","msg":"，"},{"pid":"c5b743e3d742f27deaeb15670a320d5a2fcde90e","tid":2209038,"uid":266294,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-09-19T11:04:31.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yo.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yo.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/yo.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"5587ed2608ef4e7ef3d734e61258ab45eba22a5a","tid":2209038,"uid":270889,"like":10,"dislike":0,"score":10,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2020-09-19T11:06:05.000Z","msg":"尋日呀糟想扮貼地 好似想向藍領拉票<br />\n&quot;侵睇我唔起 睇唔起靠自己雙手搵食嘅人&quot;<br />\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1307067229440225280?s=20\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FABC%2Fstatus%2F1307067229440225280%3Fs%3D20&d=1nW%2FAbATR%2BcU2iH%2BEMdxEw2E5jpmEl9YQHmcT4noKO0%3D&h=66b9a8b9\" data-ef-url=\"https://embed.lih.kg/frame?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FABC%2Fstatus%2F1307067229440225280%3Fs%3D20&h=603c0bc2\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1307067229440225280?s=20</a><br />\n<br />\n之後比人屌鳩佢:<br />\n<em>Nothing says blue collar like being a politician for 40 years and a lawyer before that<br />\n<br />\nHe&rsquo;s been a US Senator for most of his adult life.<br />\n<br />\nDude who hasn&rsquo;t worked in 40+ years<br />\n<br />\nSeems pretty out of touch as to who his base is.<br />\n<br />\nI've spent 27 years of my life working in factories, warehouses, working with my hands, all while raising a family along with my wife without assistance on limited funds.</em><br />\n<br />\nJoe Biden doesn't represent me.
