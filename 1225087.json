The HSTDV test has been conducted within three months of anti-satellite missile test 'Mission Shakti' from a defence test facility in the Indian coastal state of Odisha.<br />\n<br />\nA defence source said the Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle, an unmanned scramjet demonstration aircraft, test-fired from launch pad no-4 of the integrated test range facility at Abdul Kalam Island off Odisha coast at 11.22 hrs local time on Wednesday.<br />\n<br />\nThe HSTDV was mounted on an Agni series missile and launched in the presence of Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. &quot;Data generated during the mission are being analysed,&quot; the source added.<br />\n<br />\nOn 27 March, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the first ever test of anti-satellite missile which had successfully engaged an Indian orbiting target satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in 'Hit to Kill' mode.
