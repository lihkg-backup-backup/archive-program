I have received &ldquo;congrats&rdquo; messages from people in United States and Australia. <br />\n<br />\nThe reason is that Carrie Lam&rsquo;s English version is &ldquo;suspend indefinitely&rdquo;.  The top definition in urban dictionary (how people commonly understand the word at this age) is &ldquo;without ending, forever, endless period of time, infinite.&rdquo;  In Chinese, &ldquo;暫緩&rdquo; means &ldquo;slow it down temporarily&rdquo;. <br />\n<br />\nCarrie Lam is playing the translation trick so that the international world will not make so much noise and that the investors won&rsquo;t go away.<br />\n<br />\nPlease spread this to people outside of Hong Kong so that they are aware of this trick.<br />\n<br />\nKindly pass this on, thanks."}]}
