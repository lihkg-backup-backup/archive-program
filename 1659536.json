There have been successful European tours and Chinese tours. This year a new Chief Executive, Benedikt Fohr, took over. Van Zweden, now also the Music Director of the New York Philharmonic, will stay in charge until at least 2022, but other conductors are being nurtured, among them the territory&rsquo;s own rising star, Elim Chan. Alongside the 2020 Beethoven tributes next year (of which performances by Lang Lang and V&iacute;kingur &Oacute;lafsson are part), there will be the Asian premiere of Philip Glass&rsquo;s David Bowie inspired Symphony No 1, Low. And within the next decade it is hoped that the Philharmonic will finally be able to move into its new home, part of the enormous engineering and architectural project that is the West Kowloon Cultural District. <span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Hongkongers, ardent about their special status and willing to fight for it, can be sure that its orchestra is flying its own flag.</strong></span></span><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"040d454c2da89013fae9f4978cb4b6196b0ebeea","tid":1659536,"uid":195904,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-17T04:11:40.000Z","msg":"奶共架啦屌你老母"},{"pid":"bf6f0e6ca223dba67292ad1bb47e0c36f751a612","tid":1659536,"uid":91857,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"040d454c2da89013fae9f4978cb4b6196b0ebeea","tid":1659536,"uid":195904,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-10-17T04:11:40.000Z","msg":"奶共架啦屌你老母"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-10-17T04:15:50.000Z","msg":"太古集團首席贊助喎<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/chicken.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
