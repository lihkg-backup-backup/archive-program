I used to work in a gym and whenever a customer paid a visit to the gym I always followed it up with a call or an email. Some of my colleagues followed it up with a visit to the customer. My friend Tomiko is interested in joining his gym. She had a meeting yesterday and a follow-up has been scheduled for tomorrow. She's also writing a sequel to the acclaimed &quot;the invisible man&quot; so she's so busy that she won't have time to pay a follow-up visit to the gym for the time being. Therefore I handed her the membership agreement for Jason and will follow up with her in the next couple days. The membership costs eight hundred and fifty dollars a month which is well worth it for the whole range of facilities you can use. The membership grants you access to the swimming pool as well as the gym. They sell a tub of whey protein for five hundred dollars which is worth it as its normally twice as expensive. The cost of a tub of soy protein has edged up by three dollars while that of casein protein has edged lower by six dollars. The cost of creatine has edged down to three hundred dollars whereas that of nitric oxide has edged higher from three hundred to three twenty dollars. Last Friday Tomiko complained that she was treated badly at Starbucks. As a result a barista provided a referral to a senior staff member who in turn referred her case to the manager. She'll follow the case up with the manager to be sure that it'll be dealt with seriously. In addition she's been suffering from a stomachache so I referred her to a gastroenterologist. Recently she posted on an online forum and suggested the government build an art gallery so as to boost tourism which was supported by many people on the forum. They asked the forum administrator for a referral to a district councilor. They'll follow up the matter being discussed with the district councilor. I'll follow the issue up too. Her suggestion of building an art museum so as to boost tourism is deemed necessary. Last Monday Jason and I went to the museum where we looked at every single nineteenth-century oil painting in minute detail so as not to miss any wonderful things. He recently gave a party in Rosewood hotel instead of his house so as not to bother his neighbours. Last sunday Tomiko got off at the wrong stop and do had to wait for another train. I asked &quot;how on earth did you miss your stop?&quot; She said &quot;I'm sorry. What can I say?&quot; I complimented her on her trumpet skills. She said &quot;yes what can I say?&quot; The current situation is bad. I then said &quot;well yes what can I say?&quot; We aren't able to fix it. This morning I was shocked when I saw a car crash in the street. She said &quot;I can imagine&quot; Her boyfriend said &quot;I'm sure you were&quot;"},{"pid":"1caabe9626a085cda3040097141eca5e8a1026ea","tid":1823735,"uid":1654,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-01-14T10:41:15.000Z","msg":"too long didn't read"}]}
