The motion urged the Commissioner of Police TANG Ping-keung to lead 3,000 police officers to go to Wuhan to fight the epidemic, implement the spirit of &quot;honour, duty and loyalty&quot;, and assist local residents and the government to fight the epidemic with concrete, decisive and professional actions.<br />\n<br />\nTaking into account the lack of experienced and professional personnel in the infected areas to assist in the handling of the epidemic, the Police decided to move about 3,000 police officers to the area, including some police officers with extensive first aid knowledge. We are beginning to recruit volunteers and will arrive the destination shortly to provide assistance. We hope that the operation will play a role as a police partner in the Greater Bay Area, contributing to the compatriots in the Mainland, while achieving the effect of police communication."}]}
