A forth team, the Raptors, ambushed the animals, beating them with batons and shields.  They successfully caught the rabbit whose legs were broken and skull cracked.<br />\n<br />\nFailing to find another spare rabbit, the judges put the dead rabbit back into the forest.<br />\n<br />\nLast came the Chinese.  Without a hint of nervousness, they set up shop for a friendly mahjong game.
