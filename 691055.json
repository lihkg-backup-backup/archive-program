Documents listing locations of United States Cyber Command outposts. A passcode-protected thumb drive, hidden behind a sock in the toe of a shoe.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the Justice Department, these are among the items that United States agents found over the years while searching the luggage of Ron Rockwell Hansen, a former Defense Intelligence Agency case officer, as he flew numerous times between the United States and China. Mr. Hansen, 58, a fluent Mandarin speaker who first visited China in 1981, has allegedly received at least $800,000 in &ldquo;funds originating from China&rdquo; since May 2013.<br />\n<br />\nOn Saturday, Mr. Hansen was arrested in Seattle and charged with attempted espionage, in what appears to be another high-profile mole hunt by F.B.I. investigators intent on uncovering Chinese spying against the United States.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;His alleged actions are a betrayal of our nation&rsquo;s security and the American people and are an affront to his former intelligence community colleagues,&rdquo; John C. Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement posted on the Justice Department&rsquo;s website on Monday.<br />\n<br />\nIf convicted, Mr. Hansen faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. He is also accused of &ldquo;acting as an unregistered foreign agent for China, bulk cash smuggling, structuring monetary transactions and smuggling goods from the United States,&rdquo; the Justice Department said.<br />\n<br />\nThe charges come less than a month after a former Central Intelligence Agency officer suspected of helping China unravel the agency&rsquo;s spy network in that country was indicted on a charge of conspiring to commit espionage.<br />\n<br />\nThat officer, Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 53, had been arrested at Kennedy International Airport in New York in January, capping an intense F.B.I. mole hunt that began around 2012, after the C.I.A. began losing its informants in China.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Hansen began working as a civilian intelligence case officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon&rsquo;s main intelligence arm, in 2006, after serving in the Army for more than 20 years, according to the Justice Department. He was a case officer for the agency for several years while on active duty, and possessed top-secret security clearances for both his civilian and active-duty work.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Hansen, who once kept an apartment and office in Beijing, repeatedly offered to be a double agent for the United States against China, the Justice Department said in a 15-count complaint against him. But the F.B.I. began investigating his activities in 2014."},{"pid":"2dd141e4f638cff666a679650f173fa78142027e","tid":691055,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T11:32:30.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/lomore_agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"af4c528c4284417a5aab210460667fa60471119c","tid":691055,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-05T12:04:26.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"d8577093b2a8c0afde106a65d18075c1e38a5688","tid":691055,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-06T00:51:19.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/10.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"96c3255d098dcf9bd7af178d5441cbbac5e5cff8","tid":691055,"uid":143499,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-06T01:15:03.000Z","msg":"投靠支国<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/10.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1dad1a64d27ef0cfec2bab94e3d659c809a9bef4","tid":691055,"uid":47259,"like":5,"dislike":0,"score":5,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-06T03:01:44.000Z","msg":"所以D人係咁吹放生中興華為<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/clown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <br />\n屌你老母成個情報網俾支那收左皮仲放生你<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/fuck.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/fuck.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/fuck.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"26843a96fbb1e80b2e054d2c54e37c325d71c694","tid":691055,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-07T00:50:07.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ab96991c1e68271ba61cd6081390a9df81205c50","tid":691055,"uid":59898,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-07T00:55:59.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/04.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"0cf902dea94f8b144121382659ccf2a5243f84eb","tid":691055,"uid":141151,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-09T04:22:04.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/big/lomore_agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e838018f0b47c222bd418bc6a54737b6fa848281","tid":691055,"uid":66618,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-09T04:24:37.000Z","msg":"死刑先足夠"},{"pid":"aa838ff95f4b237eeba6d95faea8a6cfa352f825","tid":691055,"uid":136249,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-09T13:45:11.000Z","msg":"佳士得個個搞成點"},{"pid":"3640532aca165dd4b8bcb8f53b8b1cc550d95c27","tid":691055,"uid":112935,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-09T14:09:58.000Z","msg":"左膠真係隨時玩殘美國佬<br />\n仲諗住同人和理非非<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8e23b4d401d41b63a415c210710d41fa17503160","tid":691055,"uid":131157,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-06-09T22:53:55.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
