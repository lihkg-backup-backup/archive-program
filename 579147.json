If he were willing to do so for any less, he would have packed his bags after winning the FA Cup in May.<br />\n<br />\nHe still feels he has it in him to turn around this situation, however bizarre that may seem at this juncture. It's a stubbornness he simply can't change.<br />\n<br />\nIn fairness to Wenger, no one cares more about results than him. I recall one press conference a few years back when he described to a group of us how significant defeats have sometimes seen him not leave the house for two days afterwards. The pain hits him hard, and he will be feeling that right now.<br />\n<br />\nSources who know Wenger believe he is determined to continue managing into his 70s. He turns 69 in October, so there is motivation to make it through the tenure of this current contract. If he has his way, he'll sign another contract on top of it, too.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2761954-time-up-for-arsene-wenger-answering-the-big-questions-on-arsenals-boss\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2761954-time-up-for-arsene-wenger-answering-the-big-questions-on-arsenals-boss&d=mNAIbFpH%2FXaHed9whc5ruf6YfqAiA4jm3R2Vm1010vU%3D&h=628f71f5\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2761954-time-up-for-arsene-wenger-answering-the-big-questions-on-arsenals-boss</a>"},{"pid":"f7093051d4e0ccd903f3daf4c31d0f578bc79db9","tid":579147,"uid":38189,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-03-03T22:22:11.000Z","msg":"下年就走<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/@.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"50de9dbd30d567e5a1a0c10f03c53087279ea898","tid":579147,"uid":40804,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-03-03T22:35:43.000Z","msg":"爺爺70歲去考dse啦，唔好阻頭阻勢<img src=\"/assets/faces/lomoji/23.png\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"}]}
