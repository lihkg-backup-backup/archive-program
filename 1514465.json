Look in the mirror and you&rsquo;ll know. Look into your own eyes and tell me you are not heroic, that you have not endured, or suffered, or lost the things you care about most. And yet, here you are, a survivor of Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen, the hottest place anyone&rsquo;s ever known. A place where cowards don&rsquo;t last long, so you must be a hero. We all are. Some more than others, but none of us alone. Some bloody their fists trying to keep the Kitchen safe. Others bloody the streets in the hope they can stop the tide, the crime, the cruelty, the disregard for human life all around them. But this is Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen. <strong><em><ins>Angel or devil, rich or poor, young or old, you live here.</ins></em></strong> You didn&rsquo;t choose this town, it chose you. Because a hero isn&rsquo;t someone who lives above us, keeping us safe. A hero&rsquo;s not a God, or an idea. A hero lives here, on the street, among us, with us. Always here but rarely recognized. Look in the mirror and see yourself for what you truly are. You&rsquo;re a New Yorker. You&rsquo;re a hero. This is your Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen. Welcome home Hong Kongers.</span>"},{"pid":"992fadc2263b84de2ad9f0d648964da1991ec6c4","tid":1514465,"uid":149566,"like":3,"dislike":1,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-08-28T17:57:48.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"https://na.cx/i/kECxHtp.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fna.cx%2Fi%2FkECxHtp.jpg&h=b997b00f&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\">All right, Frank. You don&rsquo;t want to tell us? I&rsquo;ll tell you. I&rsquo;m gonna tell you exactly what kind of man you are. You&rsquo;re the kind of man this city needs. Because ladies and gentlemen of the jury, <strong><em><ins>we all know this city needs help. Needs it now. Not tomorrow, not next week, not when the day comes</ins></em></strong>, when the corruption that Wilson Fisk left in his wake is flushed out for good, and the police force is finally back on its feet. We need it now. &lsquo;<strong><em><ins>Cause this city&rsquo;s been sick. And the cops, they can&rsquo;t fix it alone, they need, we all need men and women who are willing to take the fight themselves. The kind of people who risk their lives so that we can walk safe at night in our own neighborhoods.</ins></em></strong> The ones our esteemed District Attorney here is trying so hard to destroy. New York needs these people.
