The snailfish will be featured as part of the Challenger Conference 2018 which kicks off at Newcastle University from today and runs until Friday.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/media/wwwnclacuk/pressoffice/images/news/september2018/Snailfish2-news-grid.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncl.ac.uk%2Fmedia%2Fwwwnclacuk%2Fpressoffice%2Fimages%2Fnews%2Fseptember2018%2FSnailfish2-news-grid.jpg&h=70de6cb3&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\nCT scan of the Atacama snailfish<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/media/wwwnclacuk/pressoffice/images/news/september2018/Snailfish-standard-right-aligned.jpg\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.lih.kg/thumbnail?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncl.ac.uk%2Fmedia%2Fwwwnclacuk%2Fpressoffice%2Fimages%2Fnews%2Fseptember2018%2FSnailfish-standard-right-aligned.jpg&h=439dabb3&s={SIZE}\" /><br />\nThe Atacama snailfish<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDetails:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/latest/2018/09/threenewspecies/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncl.ac.uk%2Fpress%2Farticles%2Flatest%2F2018%2F09%2Fthreenewspecies%2F&d=yzDWzY8%2F1k9pWZDPZiwDOu9M5Ue6CDmcYDZznX2R1Ws%3D&h=5b78b7e2\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/latest/2018/09/threenewspecies/</a>"},{"pid":"db10ba7b7e055775b8d499c1283b9708d0246d11","tid":822189,"uid":136662,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-16T08:17:32.000Z","msg":"個口定晒型但其實食緊野?"},{"pid":"bfbef82a53a103d5cf6b53adacd1d132d2ab60b4","tid":822189,"uid":77569,"like":4,"dislike":17,"score":-13,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-09-16T08:26:49.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},{"pid":"082136e5bdc51264840b83901fe776ee4dbe8e69","tid":822189,"uid":37125,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-16T09:40:04.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1c74dcc6ef1ed0340f300bb886eb8d19b568f7d4","tid":822189,"uid":37125,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-16T14:11:22.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"149c0b098f54797c31265b79b251c23927124df8","tid":822189,"uid":165773,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-17T02:21:20.000Z","msg":"靚"},{"pid":"b9d249d70a03098696e6e78afdbbd7d2b37ef385","tid":822189,"uid":181822,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-17T02:30:11.000Z","msg":"唔知好唔好食<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/tongue.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /> <img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/tongue.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1cf3b895ad6d854856de1aa8453f8dfb76a88af4","tid":822189,"uid":168366,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"quote":{"pid":"bfbef82a53a103d5cf6b53adacd1d132d2ab60b4","tid":822189,"uid":77569,"like":4,"dislike":17,"score":-13,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-09-16T08:26:49.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-17T02:30:40.000Z","msg":"引戰撚真係好撚on9而不自知<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"71c3c450ed1102f8a0858546a1f2f1b802dab12a","tid":822189,"uid":37125,"like":1,"dislike":0,"score":1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-17T07:13:46.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/hoho.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"8170a1ff4de30630f0508659cc8846f6c4e97d6e","tid":822189,"uid":82929,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-17T07:42:14.000Z","msg":"蛇形身物（其實我識分魚、爬蟲、節肢），進化出黎d動作真係好似<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/sosad.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"ae0e4484dbaa1b94b6f6ac80054044fb7b10dc62","tid":822189,"uid":10133,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"quote":{"pid":"bfbef82a53a103d5cf6b53adacd1d132d2ab60b4","tid":822189,"uid":77569,"like":4,"dislike":17,"score":-13,"citedBy":2,"replyTime":"2018-09-16T08:26:49.000Z","msg":"此回覆已被刪除"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2018-09-17T08:33:38.000Z","msg":"屌你老母"}]}
