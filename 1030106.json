It has yet to be approved by the Senate but is expected to pass.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com.hk/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6709801/amp/French-national-assembly-votes-remove-words-mother-father-school-forms.html\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com.hk%2Famp%2Fs%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Farticle-6709801%2Famp%2FFrench-national-assembly-votes-remove-words-mother-father-school-forms.html&d=IyvsStEAH7GPomOhwpmPFVJiVKGJ8LWvq%2BeQg4NrPGo%3D&h=19618d72\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.google.com.hk/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6709801/amp/French-national-assembly-votes-remove-words-mother-father-school-forms.html</a><br />\n<br />\n然後一陣如果阿媽係家長II又會話父權打壓<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/agree.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"c9f7c8bcf679c3cb5eb7972699f1c15aaa0a11b2","tid":1030106,"uid":78429,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T17:50:59.000Z","msg":"dailymail<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/beg.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"e54f233e4a1fb6bc2416c23d62b1531d516cc699","tid":1030106,"uid":41245,"like":0,"dislike":2,"score":-2,"quote":{"pid":"c9f7c8bcf679c3cb5eb7972699f1c15aaa0a11b2","tid":1030106,"uid":78429,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":1,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T17:50:59.000Z","msg":"dailymail<img src=\"/assets/faces/dog/beg.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T18:54:06.000Z","msg":"右翼先會屌左膠嘅新聞㗎嘛"},{"pid":"0f3209e9d2db33d1f81065c9890993956b189fd2","tid":1030106,"uid":136002,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T19:08:35.000Z","msg":"cls <img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/brain.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/oh.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><img src=\"/assets/faces/lm2/bang.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"9d9732b10837351e108973f4c67395ced68d5224","tid":1030106,"uid":15830,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T19:31:59.000Z","msg":"咁家長III呢？"},{"pid":"9a50b3c142f2bf51ccc1958ac74dcb479eb7c47a","tid":1030106,"uid":35598,"like":2,"dislike":0,"score":2,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2019-02-20T19:35:43.000Z","msg":"一定要兩個？<br />\n歧視多元家庭/單親家庭/單細胞繁殖生物呀？"}]}
