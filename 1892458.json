Esrig &rsquo;20 replied over the email list that he found it &ldquo;immensely disappointing&rdquo; to see the message sent during Shabbat, a time during which some Jewish people refrain from using technology.<br />\n<br />\nEsrig &mdash; a former Crimson editorial editor &mdash; also said in a Monday interview that he disagrees with the BDS movement.<br />\n<br />\nADVERTISEMENT<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;At the end of the day, BDS is not about human rights or social justice,&rdquo; Esrig said. &ldquo;It is not about ending the occupation. It's not about Israeli human rights abuses. It is about ending the Jewish state.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nSarah Bolnick &rsquo;23 wrote in an email that she was similarly &ldquo;distressed&rdquo; by the new organization&rsquo;s messaging and platform.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Even if they claim that they&rsquo;re committed to fighting anti-Semitism, this new organization is, even if unwittingly, alligning themselves with groups that have historically sought the oppression of Jews,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;To oppose Israel&rsquo;s policies or government is one thing. To reject its legitimacy is quite another.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nHillel President Rebecca S. Araten &rsquo;22 wrote in email that Hillel is committed to an &ldquo;active and constructive relationship&rdquo; with Israel, rather than one of &ldquo;alienation and vilification.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Israel is a vital crucible of modern Jewish culture and the home of nearly half of the world&rsquo;s Jewish population,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;We oppose BDS and all efforts that seek to delegitimize the State of Israel.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe coalition&rsquo;s public statement also stated that it does not claim to represent the majority of Jewish students at Harvard, but hopes to offer a space for those who agree with its mission and have felt &ldquo;alienated&rdquo; by Harvard Hillel.<br />\n<br />\nAraten, a former Crimson editor, wrote that Hillel seeks to accomodate a broad spectrum of political and ethical thought on Israel-Palestine relations.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;As a community, Harvard Hillel is dedicated to inclusive, multi-vocal conversation about Israel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Students active in our community represent a diversity of voices and political opinions, which we amplify in programming that seeks to explore the different facets of Israel.&rdquo;"},{"pid":"9cef3ba88a52af9fc1da5798302ac3ae741167b4","tid":1892458,"uid":133680,"like":1,"dislike":2,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-22T14:14:52.000Z","msg":"「抵制、撤資、制裁」（英語：Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement，簡稱「BDS運動」）是自2005年7月9日起，由英國社會運動組織一項全球性的運動[1]，目的是向以色列施壓，呼籲以色列政府停止占領巴勒斯坦國的領土，尊重阿拉伯裔以色列人的平等權益，並尊重居於海外的巴勒斯坦難民的回歸權。[1][2]<br />\n<br />\n運動組織把以色列和巴勒斯坦的現狀，把以色列對待巴勒斯坦人，在其居住地區興起隔離牆，與南非白人統治時對黑人的種族隔離政策相提並論。"},{"pid":"cf4a173fa0b794b65d58ffdf22a0b424795ca0ba","tid":1892458,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-22T14:18:24.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"80723a0156f79fdd41e59cdcbbdfbb097a107d4c","tid":1892458,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-22T14:21:24.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/frown.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"fc8cb0262fd58dda7e783498f2f7eff87e6c0d9c","tid":1892458,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-22T14:22:38.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"99743c1e698e18241aae33e3676786a21998c559","tid":1892458,"uid":26389,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-22T14:34:33.000Z","msg":"已經唔係土地問題 而係國家民族尊嚴問題<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"60efd1cf0a31ad6820b0eaa8011214a1e2c9fa61","tid":1892458,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-22T14:49:53.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/smile.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"15c88653e96a97b3c6f90ff9c4a3f5d6b1b95ba8","tid":1892458,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-22T15:01:59.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/dead.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"1a96fcae889b0431444ea3cbc3aaf26f4fb16d34","tid":1892458,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-22T15:41:14.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"3dbcf8f6222eeec26b84734987122ff485f1e72c","tid":1892458,"uid":133680,"like":0,"dislike":1,"score":-1,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-02-23T08:25:04.000Z","msg":"<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/angel.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />"},{"pid":"a9b30dcb7a0399fded43020b60d7f7f72ec793e6","tid":1892458,"uid":265192,"like":0,"dislike":0,"score":0,"citedBy":0,"replyTime":"2020-04-10T08:12:58.000Z","msg":"<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong><span style=\"color: teal;\">【國際戰線，靠你支持！】</span><br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /><span style=\"color: orange;\">頂住人民幣，對抗大外宣</span><img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/kill2.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" /></span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>為美國醫護捐贈醫療物資</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/masks-empowerment-campaign\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcharity.gofundme.com%2Fo%2Fen%2Fcampaign%2Fmasks-empowerment-campaign&d=l2jL6rfoxymyXK22uA%2BdggoJw9ynFthkhoOYQBA%2BRXM%3D&h=fbd38506\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/masks-empowerment-campaign</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>美國人權基金會成立「香港專案小組」</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://hrf-hk-desk.funraise.org/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrf-hk-desk.funraise.org%2F&d=l2jL6rfoxymyXK22uA%2BdggoJw9ynFthkhoOYQBA%2BRXM%3D&h=51131fe3\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://hrf-hk-desk.funraise.org/</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>支援台灣登報，俾世界聽到中國以外既聲音</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.zeczec.com/projects/thisattackcomesfromtaiwan\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeczec.com%2Fprojects%2Fthisattackcomesfromtaiwan&d=l2jL6rfoxymyXK22uA%2BdggoJw9ynFthkhoOYQBA%2BRXM%3D&h=eaa1d257\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://www.zeczec.com/projects/thisattackcomesfromtaiwan</a><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color: teal;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong>【登記選民，請即行動！】</strong></span></span><br />\n<a href=\"https://hk2020.vote/\" data-sr-url=\"https://r.lihkg.com/link?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhk2020.vote%2F&d=l2jL6rfoxymyXK22uA%2BdggoJw9ynFthkhoOYQBA%2BRXM%3D&h=333126a7\" data-auto-link target=\"_blank\">https://hk2020.vote/</a><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/assets/faces/normal/adore.gif\" class=\"hkgmoji\" />借位</div>"}]}
